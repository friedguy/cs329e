    "body": "I\u2019ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it\u2019s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you\u2019re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine. But in the real world, people who can\u2019t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don\u2019t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don\u2019t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people\u2019s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub\u2019s judgement of who\u2019s the asshole in a given situation. I don\u2019t know if the disparity is just because of reddit\u2019s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don\u2019t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you\u2019re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you\u2019re an asshole, well\u2026 there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they\u2019re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never seen this movie, but it\u2019s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole\u201d",

    "body": "I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",

Everyone\u2019s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. \n\nSince I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I\u2019m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \n\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI\u2019m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven\u2019t reached out to any of Marcy\u2019s family and I don\u2019t plan to.

He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff.

Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n\nAITA for this joke?",

Madeline\u2019s father died before she was born. \n \nMadeline is currently 15, and she\u2019s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad. I don\u2019t have to follow you\u201d. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that.

My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\n\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\n\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said \u201cShut up, I\u2019m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.\u201d My brother hadn\u2019t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \n\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he\u2019s a virgin and she didn\u2019t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn\u2019t need to be made fun of like this.\n\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it\u2019s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn\u2019t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\n\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems.

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n\n\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit.

This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan. \n\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. \n\nfrankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick.

He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. \n\nHe said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. \n\nLast week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him.

However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says \"but I didn't\". \n\nWhen she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd \"threatened\" to do it before (I literally just said \"okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything\" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \"expect\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \"grounded\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her \"slave\" for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/Update kinda:\n\nWow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. ",

We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her.

She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids.

He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.\n\nHowever, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.\n\nI've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.\n\nVictoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'\n\nShe looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?\n\nEdit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

I\u2019m losing sleep over this.\n\nI\u2019m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.\n\nMy brother is gay, but my family doesn\u2019t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.\n\nSo my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\u2019t told my family he is gay.\n\nI\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.\n\nBut he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\u2019t accept my brother being gay.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\u2019t say anything.\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.\n\nIf it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reason\n\nI asked him why my wedding day, he said it\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. \n\nI didn\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse\n\nWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.\n\nNext day I got a text and he said \u201c dont worry, going alone\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s happening because they didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nHe eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us\n\nThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?\n\nPS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\n\nPS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!\n\nUpdate: spoke to fianc\u00e9e, couldn\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.\n\nClarification: I know it won\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING.

C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She\u2019s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.\n\nI have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.\n\nE and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she\u2019s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time.

We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. \n\n\nThe problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn\u2019t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have \u201cblamed\u201d me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. \n\n\nI\u2019ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I\u2019ve explained that there\u2019s no chance we will ever get back together. \n\n\nSo tonight I go over to my mom\u2019s place because she\u2019s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I\u2019m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it\u2019s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. \n\n\nI\u2019m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. \n\n\nMy mom called a short while ago saying she\u2019s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she\u2019s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn\u2019t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",

It honestly helped me so much and without it I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d end up in this position.\n\nSo I went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. They of course said no. I\u2019m kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. Afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he\u2019d come to me if it meant so much. However he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn\u2019t work he\u2019d definitely accompany me to the principals office.\n\nSo I went to my teacher. I already knew how everything was going to go out so I didn\u2019t have any hope. I told her that I don\u2019t appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues I would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the Mrs.). She told me that I was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. I told her that many people don\u2019t think she\u2019s fair and in return she just looked confused. I handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she\u2019s my English teacher). Her face went from nothing to just sadness. I swear it was so weird. It\u2019s like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.\n\nShe apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. And saying my name just gets her bad memories I guess? She told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. At this point I kinda felt guilty because I never took this thought into consideration.\n\nShe told me she\u2019d try to say my name ( and won\u2019t cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime I can still call her by her first name. ( All my classmates are jealous because I\u2019m the only person allowed lol)\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about the past detentions she\u2019s given me and she said she\u2019ll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.\n\nHonestly this isn\u2019t how I thought things were going to turn out. And I\u2019m pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",

I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \"mistakes can happen.\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website.

    "body": "# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. \n\n**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!\n\n**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**\n\n> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. \n\n> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)\n\n> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)\n\n> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. \n\n**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**\n\n> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?\n\n> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). \n\n\n**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**\n\n\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n------\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n\n# Original Thread Info\n\nHey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). \n\nWe think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered \"top\" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub. \n\n---\n\n# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode\n\nFor the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be \"Best\" instead. \n\n**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",

On phone format is bad.\n\nI was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.\n\nWe end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\n\nGirl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong. \n\nSo Reddit, ATIA?",

My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents.

Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\n\r\nWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents.

I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.\n\nMy freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. \n\nAnyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.\n\nI'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything\n\nThen my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.\n\nI said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.\n\nSo I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. \n\nAnd she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.\n\nI said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. \n\nHer husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.\n\nI was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.\n\nMy mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.\n\nAITA for giving that number?",

    "body": "Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.\n\nThis is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.\n\nMe: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?\n\nMy Mom: Nothing.\n\nA long ass pause.\n\nMe: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?\n\nMy Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!\n\nMy dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.\n\nSo later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.\n\nThe conversation ended with this:\n\nSister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)\n\nSo my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.\n\nSo I say my part before leaving.\n\nMe: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.\n\nMy mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-\n\nMe: No.\n\nMy mom: But [me], we really need the money...\n\nMe: That's too bad.\n\nI get up and go off to my room.\n\nSo this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, \"what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!\"\n\nMy mom, who's listening in.\n\n\"You've seen her! She won't listen to us!\"\n\nMe: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.\n\nMy mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.\n\nThat was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.\n\nAs I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents.

    "body": "Since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time I ranted about voting on this sub. So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.\n\nYou may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:\n\n* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!\n* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!\n* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.\n\nAs you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)\n\nAlso important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. If you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and GTFO. You have come to the wrong place.\n\nP.S. If you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. Maybe you're not an asshole after all.  \n\n\nEdit:  I see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  I suggest you read the full rule book and the FAQ if you think you've got a new idea.  \n\n\n* **Rule Book**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index)\n* **FAQ:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)",

Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.\n\nThen the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.\n\nWe put our foot down and said:\n\n>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   \n>  \n>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  \n>  \n>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it.

Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak](https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak)\n\n[https://imgur.com/QySEGOS](https://imgur.com/QySEGOS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/w074cpg](https://imgur.com/w074cpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.\n\nSince my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).\n\nInspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!\n\nThank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Holiday's y'all.",

I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she\u2019s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn\u2019t understand stuff. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to put it. She\u2019s just a human body with nothing inside. \n\nShe\u2019s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don\u2019t know my stepmom very well and I don\u2019t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I\u2019m basically living with strangers because she\u2019s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I\u2019m used to it now.\n\nEver since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That\u2019s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don\u2019t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they\u2019re disappointed that I don\u2019t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. \n\nMy own mom passed away when I was small so I can\u2019t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I\u2019m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don\u2019t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don\u2019t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn\u2019t ask for this. \n\nAnyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don\u2019t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don\u2019t want to go and visit someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m there. \n\nMy stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven\u2019t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don\u2019t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don\u2019t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I\u2019m assuming my dad has told her I\u2019m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I\u2019m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. \n\nI just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I\u2019m justified in saying no.",

She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\n\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\n\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?\n\nEdit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.",

    "body": "This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\nEdit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.\n\nI sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.\n\nEdit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.\n\nBUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.\n\nI am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \n\nI thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. \n\nThis post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",

It\u2019s a huge, busy airport. There are hundreds of business travelers coming through even at 1 AM, and a huge fleet of taxis / ubers standing by to take them home.

So many people wanted me to update on my previous post and wanted me to seek professional advice first before I take matters into my own hands. Apologies if it is long. I'll try to make it as detailed as possible while making this short.\n\nI went to my local therapist and told him about my situation and asked what to do. To keep it short, he said he's heard similar recounts from before and said it is best if I tell him as soon as possible for multiple reasons and to **make sure that my bio-children are present** (multiple reasons). I asked a few of my closest friends and the majority said more or less the same thing.\n\nMy wife and I decided to sit the kids down and burst the big bubble. I asked my brother Josh to come closer and I made sure I held him close and make him feel comfortable. He asked \"What's going on?\" but I started by telling us how much we cared and loved for him, then told him everything about my parents (I put them in a bright light in hopes of a reunion) and who I am to him, then quickly hugged him and my other two kids together and told him that I love all my children the same and NOTHING is going to change my love for him. He was shocked and asked if I was joking, but I was starting to cry a little at this point, so he knew I was serious. My bio-children were very surprised too. He was in tears and asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. I didn't know what to say and said \"I was just trying to protect you, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me\", but unfortunately and understandably, he left.\n\nHe didn't talk to me as much, again, understandably so. I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said \"I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before.\" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up. There's no longer anything to hide anymore and it feels like we are born again.\n\nJosh is a tough kid, and he handled this far better than I believed he would. I'll be looking into therapy for him to help him recover just incase it doesn't go well in the long run. I'll strive and continue to be a great dad to my kids, and a great dad to my brother/son. Thank you Reddit for pushing me towards this happy ending. Thank you for all the advice and judgements I got (excluding the rude ones about my uncles and aunts -- eeek!) I love you all. Good night.",

My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\n\nToday I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined. \n\nI have said no.

We had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....\n\nMiles Trayvon\n\nWe thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be \"Tray\" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, \"This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence.\" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.\n\nI had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, \"Her name is Daisy.\" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put \"Ray Smith\", Demarcus Jones would put \"Marcus Jones\", Keshawnda Nelson would put \"Shawna Nelson\", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone. It's a family name on my husband's side.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the DMs but please stop sending me articles about the woman named Marijuana Pepsi and the black Spider-Man named Miles.

I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. \n\nMy wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old \"daddy wishes you were never born\" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.\n\nYes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. \n\nIt has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. \n \nAITA for saying it though?\n\nEdit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. \n\nWhen I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. \n\nYeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  \n\nJust because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. \n\nMy first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.\n\nRegarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",

    "body": "\nI sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender \"new skin\". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. \n\nIn some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.\n\nBut in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as \"the girl with the scar\" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.\n\nThis week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.\n\nI'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. \n\nIt also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.\n\nSo I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.\n\nI wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... \n\nHis father said to me, \"Can you cover that injury?\" \n\nI said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. \n\nHe started snapping at me saying \"there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.\"\n\nI said \"this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.\"\n\nHe started to backtrack saying \"just until it's healed\" and I said \"it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. \n\nHe actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.\n\nAITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?",

My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.\n\nMy son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.\n\nI asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a \"test run\" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.\n\nWe had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.\n\nI was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his \"first experience\" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.\n\nAITA?\n\nINFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one!

I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams \"Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!\" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor: \"Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.\n\nSupervisor: \"I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain.

While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n\nMy parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.\n\nAs I said, I know my parents.

So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \n\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \n\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

    "body": "My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.\n\nWhen I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was \"cooler\" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like \"fatass\" and \"chubster\". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).\n\nBy the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, \"He's still pretty big\", \"Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness\", \"Maybe lose a little more around that gut\". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.\n\nNow here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, \"Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?\" I flipped out. I yelled, \"Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?\"She said back to me, \"Defensive much?\"  \n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?\" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. \"Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!\" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, \"Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!\"  \n\"But you're way older!\" she whined.\n\nI left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not \"bordering\" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",

I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.\n\nShe exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.\n\nAfter her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.\n\nBut I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.\n\nHer boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

    "body": "Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. \n\nTen years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. \n\nSo here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. \n\nSo recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",

I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.\n\nAs soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.\n\nThis released an even bigger tirade and series of \"what the fuck is your problem\"-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her \"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now\". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.\n\nI noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.",

Llamas spit in self-defense.\" But they kind of laughed my warning off.\n\nNow, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.\n\nThe llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a \"warning spit\" (just saliva) and they went \"eww\" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.\n\nFinally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.\n\nTo make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.\n\nAITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",

They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. \n\nSo the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. Obviously there's no way I could have known this.\n\nI'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there.

    "body": "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",

So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. \n\nWhile it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.\n\nSo that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, \"what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?\" Without a thought I said, \"same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table\". \n\nLong story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end \"dogs aren't comparable to humans\".

This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. \n\nI was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.\n\nAfter talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.\n\nHowever, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he \"really liked it\" and \"it would only be fair\", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \"fair\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\n\nThis obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say \"but I need a chair!\" or \"What am I supposed to do now\" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.\n\nHe's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",

    "body": "I have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

    "body": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\n\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\n\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\n\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\n\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\n\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\n\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\n\nEDIT #2:\n\nNo, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \"Tiara\"\n\nNo, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\n\nNo, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\n\nYes, I correct them every time.\n\nNo, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!\n\nResponding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

I decided that I didn't want this hanging over my head in our marriage. So it was tough, but shortly afterwards one night I had a few glasses of wine and told him I had something I needed to talk about. I had considered seducing him, having sex and then telling him so I could at least do it one last time but decided that would be manipulative and dishonest. \n\nSo I sat down and told him: When I said I had \"a lot\" of sexual partners it was over a stint of about 4 months as an escort.\n\nHe was taken back a bit and said \"That's not something I'd expect.\" I figured no one would, I dress modestly, I'm pretty conservative with drinking and I volunteer with the kids programs at my church.\n\nI had tears in my eyes and asked him if his opinion of me had changed. He said \"Well what you did didn't stop you from being the woman I fell in love with so why should it?\" I started crying more...tears of joy. \n\nI begged him to let me know if he had any apprehensions or questions or if it'd come between us in any way. He said he might have questions about any cool or sexy stories sometime but for now no. He even made a quip about \"No wonder you blow my mind in having sex, you were a professional!\" Not really the type of joke I'd normally appreciate but in that time it was perfect. And we ended up going to the bedroom not too much later.\n\nSo now I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I know just how much my fiancee loves me and what he's willing to tolerate in me. It's wonderful! We're both in lockdown basically now, both working from home and I'm so thankful to be able to be with a wonderful and amazing man who I love so much and who loves me so much.\n\nThanks to everyone!",

I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL\u2019s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy.\n\nFor clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",

She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match.

I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding.

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.\n\nDad told me to bring my \"partner\" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.\n\nI notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say \"*we* will check if *we're* free\".\n\nDad replies that \"this is family only\"\n\nI reply, \"I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones\"\n\nDad says \"that's different.

I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\n\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\n\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\n\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\n\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\n\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\n\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!\n\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!\n\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\n\nI'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",

I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. \n\nI brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones \"supposed\" to carry on our name.\n\nI think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?\n\n*UPDATE* \n\nDid not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands\u2014I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I\u2019ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) \n\nAs for my fianc\u00e9\u2014 he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He\u2019s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.\n\nThank you for all the encouragement! My fianc\u00e9 and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough.",

    "body": "This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, \n\nI live on an obscure little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that\u2019s aired on the telly that I appeared on a few years ago. \n\nThe premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.\n\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \u2018room\u2019 filled with something you\u2019re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. \n\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \n\nWhen I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\u2019t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\n\nI did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.\n\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\u2019t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\n\nI told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\n\nI\u2019m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",

My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn\u2019t feel good about giving her Leyla\u2019s social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\n\nAfter explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn\u2019t have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.\n\nYesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.\n\nMoral of the story: Trust your gut on financial matters.

After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. \n\nSince all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\nI'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",

However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.\n\nThey said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.\n\nAnyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open\n\nMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. \n\nRight now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.\n\nSo I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\n\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\n\nAITA for what I did?",

Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said \"a coffee, black\", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely\n\n\"Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, h\u00e8?

Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?).

    "body": "Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. \n\nSo I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nAbout six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \n\nSo the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nMy potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\n\nETA: some questions people keep asking: \n1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and \"just do\". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. \n2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) \n3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.\n4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",

I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.\n\nThe other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nI asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?\n\nETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again.",

Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious.

He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex.

I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

    "body": "Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we\u2019d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn\u2019t find out until 20 years later. \n\nTori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he\u2019s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. \n\nHe\u2019s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It\u2019s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he\u2019s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it\u2019s been completely different since he found out about Chris.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn\u2019t matter. Any time we\u2019d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I\u2019d ask him how classes or friends were and he\u2019d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn\u2019t even mention it to me until a year later. \n\nI told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he\u2019d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\n\nWhat was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris\u2019 because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I told him this \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are going to do this. That\u2019s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I\u2019m no longer your Father and I don\u2019t want to be involved in your life.\u201d \n\nHe hung up on me. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn\u2019t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he\u2019s 22).\n\nMy family told me I\u2019m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it\u2019s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\n\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn\u2019t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn\u2019t contact me. I didn\u2019t contact them. I needed a break.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he\u2019s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \n\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \n\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son\u2019s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this \u201cAdam, you haven\u2019t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn\u2019t sit well with me. That\u2019s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I\u2019m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.\u201d Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \n\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex\u2019s affair. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",

    "body": "Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

    "body": "I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",

    "body": "Ok. I fucked up.\n\nMy brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.\n\nI told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.\n\nLast week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.\n\nMy nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?\n\nMy nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.\n\nHe had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.\n\nI spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.\n\nNow, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.\n\nAnd I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit.\n\nI tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.\n\n1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.\n2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.\n3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.\n4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.\n5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.\n6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.\n7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.\n\nEdit 2\n\nIn retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes. \n\nThanks for your comments.",

She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.\n\nI don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. \n\nWhen Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. \n\nAmy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back.

    "body": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\n\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\n\nedit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually.\n\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\n\nEdit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\n\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means?

Thanks!\n\nEdit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco.

    "body": "Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",

    "body": "My mom and I bought a duplex for me to manage and live in during my years in college. Bought the house in 2018, I moved in the summer of 2019. We installed a ring video security system, along with a front yard doorbell and backyard video floodlights.\n\nWhen I moved in, there were a ton of branches and limbs by my neighbors fence. That was odd since we only had one medium-sized tree, nearly ten feet from the fence.\n\nLater that summer, the backyard ring camera caught the neighbor throwing branches over. We realized that that is where the huge pile came from.\n\nHalloween came around and my roommate and I decided to throw a party on Friday, November 1st. We tried to talk to Ms. Stick thrower, but they were not home during our three attempts. We left a note explaining it, along with our names and numbers.\n\nThe party was 30+ people coming and going, along with music and a beerpong table in the backyard. Cops were (rightfully) called at 11:45PM; we shut it down.\n\nThe 4th, I was in class and got a front doorbell notification. It was Ms. Stick thrower pulling up my decorative styrofoam tombstones and throwing them behind my bushes. When I got home I saw that one was broken. \n\nMy roommate and I decided to call the non-emergency line about this, because obviously she had no respect for us, and this is the south so anyone could have a gun.\n\nA cop came out, we showed her everything, and we went to talk to the neighbor. Her fiancee opened the door, claimed she was not home despite her car being there.\n\nAnyways, time went on and I noticed that she came into our backyard via a gate, which was deep in my backyard. This freaked me out, as video showed her smoking and wandering around my backyard. I put a carabiner on the gate to keep her out.\n\nEnd of November, I come home and see these huge limbs flying over the fence. I get out, confront her, we argue, and she claims that she owns two feet of my backyard. She ends the conversation with \"Do you want to make these next four years a living hell?\" \n\nCalled the non-emergency number, and once again she hid from the cops. I found out that she is a professor at my university. \n\nI emailed the dean of students, told him everything and provided proof. Their resources were useless, and I am beyond fed up. Cops say they can't do anything, despite video evidence and four no trespassing signs. I want her to stop.\n\nWe got a survey done, and she does NOT own two feet into my backyard.\n\nI have edited together a video montage of her throwing limbs, branches, sticks, rocks, and cigarettes together, along with her trespassing in my backyard.\n\nWIBTA if I posted this video online with the caption \"University Professor's Actions\"?\n\nEdit: I have spoken to my mom and we just sent an email, entailing all the details plus video, to her Dean. Also, I posted to legal advice.\n\nEdit: Wow, okay, really did not expect this to get so much traction. I appreciate everyone's advice, and I plan on making many calls tomorrow. The Dean's office reopens tomorrow as well, so I might hear back from them then. Not sure whats going on with my legal post, I'll try to fix it. There is also NO TREES/BRANCHES HANGING OVER THE FENCE. She is throwing branches from her yard into mine. In the beginning, I threw the branches back over, but they would magically appear with even more. So I gave up.\n\nFinal Update: Here\u2019s a podcast I went on! https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aita-being-pissed-that-i-got-peloton-for-my-birthday/id1457999881?i=1000465821291",

I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to \u201chumor\u201d me. \n\nMark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. \n\nHe sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me.

    "body": "I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",

At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff.

Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201cI mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201d\n\n\nI made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201cgift card\u201d on the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like \u201calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201d But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not.

We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.\n\nSo anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n\nI\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. \n\nWhen the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off. \n\nA manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave.

It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount).

    "body": "So I had an overwhelming response to my post about asking if I was TA for kicking a girl out of my bridal party for being sensitive about dresses, and I got a lot of NTA/ESH, and I could see both sides, understood that I could have handled it better, and I was glad to see that a lot of people also believed that Joy was being \u201ca lot to handle\u201d. Anyways, I decided to take your advice, and here\u2019s an update on the situation, for anyone that\u2019s interested!\n\nSo after reading a ton of your comments, I decided to call Joy and invite her over to talk. Luckily, she said yes (by the way, before this, she didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want to be at my wedding, so she was still planning on becoming a guest), and I apologized for kicking her out with no warning, but I laid out my frustrations. She apologized for being really picky about the dress and realized that the attention wasn\u2019t going to be on her and it wasn\u2019t her day, so it wasn\u2019t really appropriate for her to get upset over fine details on a dress. She also revealed to me that this was going to be her first time being a bridesmaid (she doesn\u2019t usually wear dresses, she\u2019s more of a leggings and sweatshirt type of girl). I took some of your guys\u2019 advice again and asked Joy to show me a couple of dresses online she would be comfortable with (didn\u2019t matter what color, I just wanted to see her style), and she searched for about 10 minutes and couldn\u2019t find one that she \u201cloved\u201d. She kind of looked bummed and a little apologetic, so I came up with a plan. The official dress shopping day for the bridesmaids was the next day, and I invited Joy to go with us, to get a feel for the dresses, to see if she would be comfortable. She agreed.\n\nSo the next day, my girls and I met up at a dress place, tried on a couple of dresses, and Joy didn\u2019t really like them, even though my other bridesmaids did. Finally, we tried on the 4th dress, which was THE one. The girls fell in LOVE with it, and I looked at joy and she was staring at herself in the mirror, but she had a smile on her face! :) I came up to her and told her again I didn\u2019t mind if she wore a shawl or cover up for some moments, and she nodded and smiled again. Actually one of my bridesmaids (who didn\u2019t really know about the situation) came up to joy and told her how gorgeous she looked in the dress. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears because they all looked so beautiful.\n\nSo we found a dress that was matching and all the girls were happy with, and Joy is back in the bridal party. Hope that this was a happy ending that everyone enjoyed :) Now for me, I have to go to plan other parts of the wedding with my fianc\u00e9:)\n\nEdit: I couldn\u2019t find the actual dress, but I did find something very similar online.\n\nhttps://www.kleinfeldbridalparty.com/shop/dresses/viewitem-KL2160586?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn8nqwo-q5wIVWgOzAB3N9wO6EAkYASABEgJuE_D_Bw\n\nEdit 2: and thank you guys for all the rewards!! <3. I just wanted to say that a little bit of communication can go a long way.

I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?\n\nEdit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",

    "body": "\nI'm in high school, we had a final presentation before winter break, and we had judges from the community come in to reward the best presentations. Like not actual court room judges, just people who were involved in stuff locally. The prize was some scholarship money for college. \n\nOur classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.\n\nIt was annoying how the \"outside judge\"kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??\n\nIt was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.\n\nSo I went up and said \"Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.\"\n\nShe sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. \n\nThe girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.\n\nMy principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detention\n\nAITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?\n\nEdit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be.",

    "body": " My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\n\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\n\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\n\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There's really no chance.\"\n\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\n\nI said \"We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\n\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\n\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\n\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother.\" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\n\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\n\nI hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",

    "body": "Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a \"puppy package\" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\n\nVT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...\n\nMe: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.\n\nVT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.\n\nMe: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\n\n\\*silence\\*\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...\n\nVT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.\n\nMe: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.\n\nVT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.\n\nMe: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.\n\nVT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.\n\nMe: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?\n\nVT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.\n\nMe: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:\n\n1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.\n2. It amazes me how many of you post things like \"you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this\"... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.\n3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).\n4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.\n5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.\n\nTo maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks?

    "body": "[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)\n\nSo, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \n\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn\u2019t I tell her earlier and she\u2019s so proud of me\n\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\n\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\n\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn\u2019t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \n\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\n\n> I\u2019m sorry for how I reacted; please don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It\u2019s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you\u2019re going to be where I wanted to be and I\u2019m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ranting I just need more time\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\u2019re best friends and I just don\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\n\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \n\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\n\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\n\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",

    "body": "For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n\nI told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n\nIn all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. \n\nShe's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n\nHad another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n\nEDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. \n\nAlso, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n\nRegarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n\nAnd for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. \n\nRegarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n\nLast but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",

Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?",

    "body": "My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). \n\nHe's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said \"I want to wear this.\" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. \n\nI figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. \n\nI drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. \n\nMy wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as \"the one who wore a dress\" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. \n\nAt the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it.

    "body": "My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.\n\nThere was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.\n\nThe whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a \"super duper cool girl\".\n\nAnyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)\n\nThe final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.\n\nthe SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.\n\nMy daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying \"why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??\". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.\n\nMy daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:\n\nD \"hey its me\"\n\nSB \"thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha\"\n\nD \"what\"\n\nSB: \"arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts\"\n\nSB \"slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool\"\n\nD \"u dont like the party..?\"\n\nSB \"I jus wish i could go home looool\"\n\n\\~end\n\nIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).\n\nI took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said \"because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go.\" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.\n\nI talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said \"its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.\"\n\nI thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.\n\nMy wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?",

    "body": "My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.\n\nMy mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.\n\nLong story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.\n\nWas I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).\n\nedit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?\n\nThere's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.\n\nLike one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.\n\nThis is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. \n\nMuch of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not \"trying harder\" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator.",

    "body": "I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. \n\n\n\nMy father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. \n\nMy mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. \n\nShe was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. \n\nMy mother was devastated and stopped eating properly.\n\n\n In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. \n\nAll this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. \n\nDuring her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. \n\nWhen he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) \n\nMy mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.\n\nI believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time.\n \n---------\n\nEdit : I want to make some facts clear -\n\n1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. \n\n\n2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit 2 :\n\n\n3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. \n\nIn fact, she didn't mention him at all. \n\n4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.\n\nWe have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.\n\nI plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support.",

    "body": "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\n\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nWell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?\n\nEdit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as \"why are you so shity?\" because I've been banned.\n\nEdit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\n\nEdit3: gotta address this one directly:\n\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.\n\nIf the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process.\n\nEdit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him. \n\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\n\n\nEdit5: a good question:\n\n>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.\n\nNo he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.\n\nEdit6: another good question\n\n>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?\n\n\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nEdit7: \n\n>INFO\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\n\nSo this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine \"nerd\" could correct me if I'm way off base.\n\nEdit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.\n\n> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.\n\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\n\n1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\n\n2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the \"you're a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \n\n3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. \n\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \n\n5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).\n\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\n\n>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEdit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\n\n\nEdit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the \"malfunction voids all pays and plays\" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

I was like \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. At first, I was like \u201cHell no.\u201d But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I\u2019m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\n\n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it\u2019s weird).\n\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\n\n3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\n\n4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman\u2019s history with her father? \n\n5. What\u2019s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\n\nI know, I\u2019m not the girl\u2019s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \n\nSo, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I\u2019m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \n\nAfter only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is \u201cNone of my business.\u201d I got a little pissed at that. \n\nI told him he\u2019s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I\u2019m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. I replied that I\u2019m uncomfortable having a dude who\u2019s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you\u2019re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.\n\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it\u2019s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\n\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?\n\nEDIT: some info:\n\nI asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.\n\nI would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \n\nWhen I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\n\nI would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what\u2019s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They\u2019re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. \n\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. \n\nAsked why they broke up.\n\nThe guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.",

    "body": "My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \"fun\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \"acceptable\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\n\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \"green\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\n\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \"unethical\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\n\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.\n\n**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",

    "body": "A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\n\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\n\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\n\nWas I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\n\nEdit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.\n\nEdit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.",

    "body": "I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.\n\nWe hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.\n\nOn Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.\n\nI got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.\n\nI fucking screamed \"What the hell are you doing?!\" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.\n\nAfter I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that \"ugly ass\" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.\n\nBlack Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.\n\nI asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned \"Get the fuck out of my house. Now.\" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.\n\nOf course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't \"graciously\" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an \"honest mistake\" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said \"You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that.\" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.\n\n**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",

Septum piercings are usually tagged as \u201clooking like a bull\u201d (I don\u2019t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of \u201ctake that thing out of your nose, you\u2019re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.\u201d The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn\u2019t be so polite.

And for that matter, I shouldn\u2019t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. \n\nFast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she\u2019s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times?

    "body": "First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?",

Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d \n\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \n\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \n\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \n\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \n\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far?\n\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did.\n\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. \n\nAnd to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate.

Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.\n\nI made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are \"boycotting\" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast. She apparently cried over it.\n\nEDIT: did not expect this post to blow up like that, thanks for the awards and the comments. ",

Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.\n\nI was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.\n\nJosh, now almost 13, has been calling me \"dad\" and my wife \"mum\" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.\n\nSome of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me \"dad\" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.\n\nI discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the \"father figure\" everyone deserves.\n\nI feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying \"sooner than later\". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys.",

    "body": "My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.\n\nMy husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )\n\nI would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.\n\nIt's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. \n\nYesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.\n\nToday I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.\n\nTLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.\n\nEdit: to answer questions that people have been asking.\n\nYes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.\n\nYes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.",

Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone.\n\nSo I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it).\n\nAfter dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than \"I'm sorry you're right\" people will say \"Accept your judgment!\" and if I reply \"Thanks\" to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation.\n\nShout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote:\n\nLooks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies.

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like \"I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago\" \"They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park\". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.\n\nOne of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.\n \nNow yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.\n\nMy boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",

Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don\u2019t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend \u201cUgh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.\u201d\n\nI shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s an actual well known exercise) \n\nThe same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf \u201cLook there she goes again, and her forms terrible.\u201d Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.\n\nAt this point I call her out. I said \u201cOi, you.\u201d She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically \u201cYou in the purple top.\u201d \n\nShe turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:\n\nMe; Do you want to fuck me?\nHer: What?!\nMe: I said do you want to fuck me?\nHer: What the fuck is wrong with you?\nMe: Well you keep staring at me, so I\u2019m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?\n\nShe went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn\u2019t see them again.\n\nWhen I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. \n\nMy defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn\u2019t talk shit if she doesn\u2019t want called out on it.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business.",

    "body": "Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?\n\nTHIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.\n\nINFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. \n\nAs for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her \"stuff\".  She already has \"stuff\".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with \"stuff\".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.\n\nUpdate for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.\n\nUpdate for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to \"retire\" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week \"preschool\" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and \"bless\" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.\n\nLastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  \n\nI still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.\n\n\nUPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough \"things\" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on \"giving\" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a \"new tradition\" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.\n\nTo those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and \"not bothered to budget for it once it came\" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",

This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. \n\nSo for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said \"I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am.

    "body": "This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.\n\nHere we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he \"looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair\". I texted back, \"I'll take it for $4,000\" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.\n\nHere's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, \"well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask.\" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to \"sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam.\" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: \n\nWell this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:\n\nThe guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.\n\nThe dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.\n\nI would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would \"do bad things\" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.\n\nAnd to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",

    "body": "Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.\n\nBackground: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.\n\nWe were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'\n\nHe replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.\n\nWe didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'\n\nI was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.\n\nHe told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??\n\nHe screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.\n\nI tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.\n\nI'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. \n\nHis mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.\n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!",

I thought he had a little cold with the only reasoning being that his ears felt a little warm, he wasn't eating as much as he normally does and he was due for his shots anyway. So I cooked dinner for all of us while they took him to the vet on my dime. I called them after an hour and asked how things were going and my father told me everything was good and he had a little fever. Fast forward another hour, they come back and let themselves in and I open the door to my mother sobbing and my father slinking in the corner. Turns out the vet found a large mass on his Kidney and suspected it was stage 3-4 cancer. So my parents, without calling me, had him put down to \"spare my feelings\".\n\nI told them both to leave and that I never wanted to speak to them again. That it wasn't their decision to make and they should have called and told me the situation so I could at the very least say good bye and be with him. That by failing to tell me, they stole an opportunity for any closure I could have. I raised that cat from a feral kitten with his mother and his brother from the time he had his eye's open. He was only 10.\n\nI'm equally heart broken and furious and they can't seem to understand why. They proceeded to berate and belittle me, going as far as to say I wasn't sad, just angry and that I was: \"ruining a beautiful and tragic moment\" and that it was my fault because I didn't go with them. Edit: As just to be clear the never wanting to see them again bit was after this attempt to make me feel bad for being angry.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I'm turning off reply notifications. 99% of you can form a reasonable response, NTA/YTA/ETA.

    "body": "I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.\n\nSo I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.\n\nThis is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.\n\nI asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.\n\nOverall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.\n\nEDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. \n\nFast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like \"What kinda name is Dimitri?\", or \"You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name.\" \n\nIt's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of \"You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.\"\n\nSo my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either.

We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.\n\nMy mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.\n\nSo, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.\n\nHe's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?",

We are in the middle of a divorce because while she\u2019s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. \n\nFor financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and \u201cyeah yeahed\u201d me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it.

Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. \n\nI\u2019ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future.

It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.

    "body": "My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn\u2019t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn\u2019t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nAfter the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn\u2019t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.\n\nThings got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.\n\nThe conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn\u2019t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I\u2019ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we\u2019re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.\n\nSo I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can\u2019t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife\u2019s parents, her sister, and my mom.\n\nA lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?",

The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). \n\nBoyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to \"accept\" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. \n\n\nFast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's \"hers\" and \"you already bought it\".

I didn't write down my thought process properly; I've got them gifts before but they were \"experiences\" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a \"proper\" gift that they can actually keep and immediately \"have\" if that makes sense.

I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her). Thanks for all the ideas as to how to approach her and this conversation. And yes I understand that she is still dealing with her parents breaking up and I feel for her, I really do.**",

He\u2019d think it\u2019s way too fancy, way too much. \n\nHe and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201d \n\nTo remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren\u2019t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, \n\nThis morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. \n\nI also reached out to some of my brother\u2019 s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we\u2019re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.\n\nThanks again.",

Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they\u2019ve never don\u2019t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they\u2019ve only dated for a little more than a year. \n\nI told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.\n\nThe problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn\u2019t have to work at all during the school year. \n\nSince I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.\n\nShe now says that she\u2019s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she\u2019s not going to school, she\u2019d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.\n\nI told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she\u2019s married, I\u2019ll be happy to contribute the money. But it\u2019s not just a free handout.\n\nShe\u2019s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he\u2019s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fianc\u00e9, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.\n\nWell we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don\u2019t want her to think I support this decision.\n\nShe told me she sorta saw my point, but she\u2019s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she\u2019s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she\u2019s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",

Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.\n\nI am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (\"Im an adult OP, I can do what I want\"). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a \"bullet dodged\" party. \n\nHe had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because \"Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill.\" \u2026.. right. \n\nI was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words \"pack your shit and get the fuck out\" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, \"all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.\"\n\nHere's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.\n\nso reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: so I didn\u2019t think this would get as much traction. I\u2019ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don\u2019t care what your views on abortion are, or how you don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for her pregnancy. So please do not comment if you\u2019re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.\n\nEDIT 2: I cam currently trying to track the girl down.

Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too.

There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.\n\nAt the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short.

I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure.

We had the \"what if\" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.\n\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.\n\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\n\nAITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?\n\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\u2019m going to get snipped ASAP.\n\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",

Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.\n\n\nRecently, we had a watch party at Jan\u2019s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said \u201cI sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.\u201d \n\nJan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn\u2019t appreciate that I called him skinny. \n\nThis caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying \u201cwhat makes you think that you can call him skinny when you\u2019re literally built of twigs?\u201d \u201cYou would die playing football. Tbh I don\u2019t think you could even lift a helmet!\u201d \n\nAt first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.\n\n\u201cLook at you, you\u2019re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials\u201d  (I\u2019m brown but not African)\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you.

But then I snapped.\n\nHer: \u201cGo lift some weights. It\u2019s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIf you could tell me what your current diet is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll put on weight in no time.\u201d\n\n*silence*\n\nHer: \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m saying that if I\u2019m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser.

The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.\u201d\n\nAt this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.\n\nSince this was at Jan\u2019s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan\u2019s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far.

My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing.

He\u2019s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it\u2019s helped somewhat.\n\nTheir dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son\u2019s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. \n\nMy daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. \n\nHer college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn\u2019t leave, and he wasn\u2019t calm for hours. I\u2019d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it. \n\nShe called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I\u2019d missed every game and performance she\u2019d had as a child and it clearly wasn\u2019t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can\u2019t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I\u2019ve barely spoken with her since. She didn\u2019t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn\u2019t shown up for holidays and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s engaged but didn\u2019t call to tell me. She\u2019s cut us out, and in the one of three times we\u2019ve spoken since she said it\u2019s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn\u2019t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. \n\nAITA - I\u2019ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn\u2019t a perfect mom growing up - I didn\u2019t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I\u2019m heartbroken but I don\u2019t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",

It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. \n\nEnter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).\n\nHer kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. \n\nI tried being polite about it \"Sweetie where's your mommy?\" -points to mom- \"Ma'am!\" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says \"I don't wanna\" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. \n\n\nFinally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record \"why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that\" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. \n\nI'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. \"LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!\" \n\nPeople looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn\u2019t want her boys to see it. \n\nNow it\u2019s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. \n\nAnyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. \n\nNow I\u2019m back she\u2019s started a new thing.

We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. \n\nWhen my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn\u2019t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. \n\nSince I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that\u2019s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I\u2019m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. \n\nI moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we\u2019ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I\u2019m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. \n\nFor the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don\u2019t. She keeps telling me that \u2018even if I don\u2019t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they\u2019re innocent in all this\u2019 \n\nAITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family?

    "body": "Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. \n\nIn my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. \n\nIt came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. \n\nTonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. \n\nAfter not much googling at all I found \"our\" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. \n\nThis leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. \n\nI think this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I shared this knowledge with my mom?",

    "body": "So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.\n\nI knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nThese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.\n\nSuffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.\n\nI've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to \"work it out\" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to \"Reconcile\" i've shut it down,\n\nMy friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",

    "body": "I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\n\nI'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).\n\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.\n\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. \n\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\n\nUpdate: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",

    "body": "Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.\n\nThat was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would \"basically be the same thing\". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for \"shaming him and his wife on the internet\". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",

We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.\n\nWhen I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. \n\nBut after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, \"Dirty little sheet heads!\" became his favorite punchline.\n\nThe final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.\n\nThe wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident.

You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.\n\nShe's a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. \n\nIf you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.\n\n(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)\n\nThat's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.\n\nOur anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, \"I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again.\" We ended up going out instead.\n\nIt kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden \"because she likes the red sauce\" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.\n\nShe also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.\n\nI just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.\n\nTL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?\n\nEdit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.\n\nEdit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick\n\nEdit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?\n\nAlso, yes, I wash the dishes\n\n#Final Edit:\n\nOkay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess.\n\nI really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.\n\nSo her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.\n\nShe said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. \n\nI'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.\n\nSo, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.\n\n",

My sister was there when I pushed her out and apologized for being a bridezilla so all is well and I have a cute baby.\n\nSorry that this was an anticlimactic update but I give the people what they want.\n\n\n\nETA: sorry guys no baby tax. I\u2019m not comfortable posting photos on a public forum, especially with some creeps and assholes on here.\n\nWow I\u2019m an idiot I should absolutely update what happened at the wedding sorry I got that mommy brain\n\nShe still wanted everyone to wear black, but she did go lax on style.

    "body": "Heya. \n\nSo this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. \n\nI take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background: \n\n I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). \n\nIve had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. \n\nNow onto the story: \n\nI'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. \n\nI look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. \n\nThe man was stuttering and saying things like \"I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says \"seizure alert dog\").\" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes \"my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog\" \n\nI told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. \n\nI was then at my stop and ran home.\n\nI felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. \n\nShould I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?\n\nEdit to clear up some things: \n\n-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation\n-I'm a female :) \n-I live in Canada\n-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse \n-If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.\n\n\n\nEdit: I didnt know about the dog tax! Attached: [The headshot my work took for our HR Directory! ](https://imgur.com/a/Xm2lRpc)",

My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I\u2019ve never cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. \n\n\nDinner was going alright until Amy\u2019s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entr\u00e9e. After that, Amy, who isn\u2019t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn\u2019t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. \n\n\nI loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary. Amy isn\u2019t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and Amy\u2019s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy\u2019s boyfriend to get up and leave with her.

It's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.\n\nIt seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to \"get out\" is actually incredibly scary to me.\n\nThis isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.\n\nI *am* the asshole, I already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. Sorry, teenagers, but I kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. I wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but I would also be looking at their advice differently if I knew their lack of life experience. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust be careful everyone. And please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub.

She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.\n\nIt's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is \"ridiculous\", and she needs to \"get some therapy\" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.\n\nShe was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. \n\nJust to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold.",

I will most likely not be continuing the week on/off arrangement at my dad's house this year.\n\nThe reason I initially got from my dad is that apparently I'm better at getting rides, while my step brother keeps bugging them for rides. And also because my stepbrother is there full time and I'm only there every other week.  I think that's totally bullshit. He knows how difficult it has been to get to my part time job. My stepbrother doesn't even have a job, like damn. And now the custody bs is my problem? I don't think so.\n\nI took the gift card and told my dad not to bother with getting me a car. I'm currently \"borrowing\" my grandmom's 2002 Corolla and I love it. And all I have to do in exchange is drive my grandmom around whenever she wants. It's awesome. We have a blast going around town.\n\nThere were a lot of different judgements on my initial post but at least I know I'm not completely crazy.\n\nPeople might think I'm being an entitled brat and that's fair. But I was legit so grateful for the gift card. I was freaking out. But I felt so stupid when I found out what my stepbrother got. It's not that I needed a car. I just wanted to be treated equally.\n\nThis is the first time ever I've been actually resentful about having my step brother in my life. Which I don't want to feel but it's the truth. They could've bought two cars for what they spent on my step brother's car. \n\nI don't hate my dad. But I realized that I can't really expect him to do right by me without me bitching about it. He's been sending money to my mother now since I'm here full-time. Some of that money is used to pay for my insurance. \n\nHe does text me a few times a week and I reply but I don't really have long conversations with him. I know he's sorry and he wants me around. But I just need some space from him. It kinda sucks realizing that a parent might not love you as much as you thought they did. But I'm sure our relationship will improve in time.\n\nI'm on track for college this year and I want to focus on school and put all this behind me. I'll be one of the few people from our family going to college so everyone is pretty excited.\n\nSo all in all, I think the outcome is pretty positive. \n\nThanks guys.",

    "body": "I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! \nI\u2019m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced \u201cAcadian/Chiac\u201d accent. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I\u2019m perfectly bilingual in both languages.\n\nI started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they\u2019ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn\u2019t want to be rude to his family but it\u2019s getting super weird. I don\u2019t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I\u2019m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said \u201ca la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cto the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth\u201d when she meant \u201cthis pumpkin pie tastes delicious\u201d) \nShe constantly criticizes my \u201caccent\u201d.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to \u201cpick a language\u201d when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper \u201cfran\u00e7ais standard\u201d is actually getting harder for me since I\u2019ve been only studying/working in English). \n\nSo last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn\u2019t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  \nTurns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might\u2019ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it\u2019s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn\u2019t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",

    "body": "I've \\[F21\\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. \n\n\nIt came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. \n\n\nAs I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says \"Dear, will you sit down for just another moment.\" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. \"With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,\". I looked at her like \"what the fuck\" and she continued \"well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,\". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say \"you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,\".\n\nI was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don\u2019t want to go after anybody\u2019s job, but I don\u2019t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. \n\nWill I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?\n\nEdit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said \u201cI appreciate your openness and honesty tho\u201d (like that mattered after anything she just said \ud83d\ude29) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said \u201cthanks\u201d and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn\u2019t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. \n\nAlso, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. \n\nAnd for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I\u2019m having more fun than u \ud83d\ude18\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nBefore I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. \n\n1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. \n\n2) for ever man calling me a slut: you\u2019re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so \u201cclosing my legs\u201d or \u201cquit being easy\u201d doesn\u2019t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single \u201cwhore\u201d had one thing in common and that\u2019s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! \n\n3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody\u2019s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. \n\nNow to the update: \nI called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn\u2019t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. \n\nFirst and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. \n\nI explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she\u2019s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. \n\nI then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn\u2019t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. \n\nThe lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she\u2019d \u201ccall the doctor (her supervisor)\u201d right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn\u2019t be back in the office until next Monday. \n\nWith all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You\u2019ve truly been so helpful. \n\nAnd for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn\u2019t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",

I\u2019m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. \n\nWhen I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. \n\nThis has put a strain on my mothers and I\u2019s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. \nShe didn\u2019t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I\u2019d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn\u2019t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. \n\nPeople ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this \u201cfamily friend\u201d. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. \n\nI\u2019ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. \n\nMy mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it\u2019s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she\u2019s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it\u2019s been years, why else would you want to catch up?\n\nMy new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn\u2019t agree with it, it\u2019s been years, he wasn\u2019t in her life yet.\n\nShe asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; \n\n\u201cTo be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy\u2019s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn\u2019t ruin this one, but why don\u2019t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?\u201d\n\nShe cried, said she couldn\u2019t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven\u2019t spoken for a few days.\n\nToday, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy\u2019s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she\u2019s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I\u2019m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",

Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few years after we married I decided to go to law school. Long story short, I ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. Since I managed not to go into debt, I have a good bit of money left over after I make my contributions to our joint expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that I get to buy most of the things I want while she is on a much more limited budget), and I told her I would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. I think fair is fair since this was her idea, but I do wonder if  I am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

    "body": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.\n\nMe and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.\n\nLast year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.\n\nAs she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'.\n\nSince I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. \n\nUnfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.\n\nEDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

    "body": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I'm your friendly, neighborhood subreddit founder.  The rest of the team and I have been busting our humps day in and day out moderating away the very worst vitriol and troll traffic we find in this space and we think we've earned the right to consider our growing forum **NOT the most evil place on reddit**...maybe even not bottom five.  This is just ducky, but we think we can do more to make this a positive and generous place, even if we can't get y'all to behave all the time.   In addition to being really jazzed about telling others how to act, we have also discovered that we're a cabal of unapologetic dog lovers punctuated by a few weirdos who like cats.\n\nWith that in mind, we've decided to try to do some good with our moralizing, finger-wagging forum by trying something new:\n\n# The Rescue Dog of the Moment\n\nIf you miss the cute segment on morning news when they bring out a group of local shelter pets, to get them a publicity bump, but you never get to see that because *who the hell is watching local morning news anymore,* then this post is for YOU!\n\n# [This is Hazel](https://imgur.com/gallery/tAqmmCX)!\n\nHazel is a 4 year old Rottweiler/Boxer(?)/Pittie(?) who's been living in her foster home for 2 years waiting for her furever home.  She's healthy and happy.  She is a sweet, gentle lady who loves to kiss faces and is prone to occasional bursts of silliness.\n\nShe's available to adopters in and around New England.  If you'd like to consider giving Hazel the home she richly deserves, her adoption profile is here: [https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/](https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/) (And if you DO eventually adopt her, be sure to come back here to brag so you can be sub hero for a week!)\n\nIf you aren't in the Northeast, but have the kindness to adopt a dog in need, try searching for a rescue organization on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/animal-shelters-and-rescues/search/). I promise that there are many great dogs and probably many great rescue orgs in your area!\n\n**Some ground rules:**\n\nThe way it works is we're going to sticky this post until Hazel gets a home with a \"furever\" family.  We're not going to show you a dog and say he's on death row.  We're not going to shock or depress you with a canine trainwreck and ask for donations for vet bills.  We'll just keep one happy pup's picture up, while she's safe in a loving foster home, and hope that you'll share her pics and check out her rescue site until somone takes this lovable little fuzzface home.  If a subscriber does adopt her, we'll even keep her  sticky post up for a while after adoption, giving the adopter plenty of time to brag about their new furkid and post happy pictures of their new best goodgirl at home.  **Let's see if 1.5 million potential assholes can bring a family together before the year's over!**\n\nIf you don't want to see rescue dogs, all you have to do is ignore one sticky post, quit yer whining, and enjoy the sub as usual.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a board member of Hazel's rescue.  No money is changing hands and no considerations are being offered or transferred between us.  I just want to make room for one more deserving dog to get out of the shelter system and get as many of you thinking about fostering, rescuing, and adopting-not-shopping as possible.\n\nP.S. If you happen to be Chrissy Teigen, please tweet about this!\n\n*Edit:  It seems there is a substantial group of people with hatred for dogs or specific breeds out there on reddit, and they have come to this discussion to try to spoil a good thing with baseless accusations fueled by paranoia. Whenever any dog has shown the slightest interest in chasing cats (or in Hazel's case, because she has chased squirrels and rabbits in her foster's yard), the rescue puts the exaggerated statement \"They think that cats are tasty treats\" into the Petfinder description so that no one with a cat becomes interested, and we never have to risk an adopter irresponsibly mixing that dog with their cat. Hazel has NO history of aggression against people or cats.  --Anyone saying she was abandoned because of either of these things is making up stories.--*  \n\n*Out of abundant concern, the rescue will not place her with any households that will mix her with cats. As for small children...there is no history of aggression toward people of any age. It's my feeling that a healthy and friendly 65lb dog who occasionally runs around with excitement can knock little kids down and bump them by accident. (Ever have a dog headbutt you because you were leaning over them when they decided to jump up? That kind of thing.) The rescue will explain her energy level in detail to any family with small children who applies and let them decide if they think their child is old/large/mature enough to handle this. In some cases, the rescue will make that evaluation and not approve the application. This is a very thoughtful, careful process that is carried out in private between the individual who applies and the co-ordinator who knows the dog much better than I (or anyone in a comment stream making gross assumptions) does.*",

    "body": "So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.\n\nMy boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.\n\nFor an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.\n\nA few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.\n\nSo last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.\n\nHe doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).\n\nI've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.\n\n\nEdit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.\n\nThough I haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, I'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  Whether you think I'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and I appreciate that.",

    "body": "BACKSTORY:\n\nI failed my first 400-level\u00a0 physical chemistry test 2 months ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn\u2019t quite what I expected it to be. (That\u2019s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)\n\nSide Note: The class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is \u2018easy\u2019. I didn\u2019t know this. The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn\u2019t think it was \u2018easy\u2019 after those 2 exams.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: Our professor is old and I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)\u00a0 and some students had used that to score A\u2019s and B\u2019s. (We can\u2019t really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful).\u00a0Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online.\u00a0\n\nEXAM DAY:\n\nI was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this. This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy\u00a0 for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. I didn\u2019t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.\u00a0 I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped it up.\u00a0\n\nOnce I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.\u00a0 I answered ALL of them incorrectly, though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn\u2019t answer them in the given time (I was right).\u00a0\n\nPRESENT DAY:\n\nI scored a high B, and the curve put my grade at an A.\u00a0\n\nI had the fourth-highest score on the exam.\n\nMost students failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. I saw that a LOT of them (I\u2019d estimate about 13-15 students based on what I saw ) used the \u201dfake\u201d methods I had used on those incorrect answers.\u00a0 More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that I\u2019d screwed some of the cheating students.\u00a0\n\nI honestly can\u2019t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my GPA and my future.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: \nA common argument I see here is \u201cSee you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!\u201d \nI studied like a maniac. I didn\u2019t go out, didn\u2019t attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. It\u2019s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because I didn\u2019t have much going on in my other classes.",

    "body": "My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn\u2019t the issue... it\u2019s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she\u2019s lying left & right. I just don\u2019t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\n\nThe theft: \n\nOn Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband\u2019s aunt & uncle\u2019s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we\u2019ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn\u2019t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\n\nWell..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\n\nMy kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle\u2019s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\n\nDue to Cousin\u2019s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It\u2019s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed about the thievery, but I\u2019m even more upset over my kid\u2019s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn\u2019t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \n\nI feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter\u2019s help from money she would \u201cearn\u201d by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\n\nI mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don\u2019t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. \n\nAlso - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.\n\n\n\n***Edit: I\u2019ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I\u2019m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her \u201cno\u201d to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",

It blew up. It ended up on Twitter. People shared it to Facebook.\n\nThe general consensus was, yes, that I am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. A couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. More than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. \n\nWell.\n\nAfter I posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. She started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. Everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.\n\nThen one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, \"Do you seriously fucking think that I *actually like* eating at Olive Garden?\"\n\nGuys, she saw the post. She was *furious*. \n\nShe doesn't like Olive Garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. I was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, \"she never developed a taste for pasta, she's Latino, do I ever see her make pasta? No. A meal isn't complete without rice. You don't know me at all.\"\n\nShe yelled about Olive Garden for a solid twenty minutes. It wasn't just about Olive Garden, but it was a lot about Olive Garden.\n\nLong story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. She \"loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage\" from me for her own personal betterment.\n\n So, yeah.\n\nTL;DR: I ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. I didn't take her out on dates and I didn't pay enough attention. I would do anything to fix everything.\n\nEdit: To clarify a few things\n\n1. I didn't post on April First.\n\n2. I say that she yelled about \"mostly Olive Garden\" because she did. She was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over Olive Garden, where the kids are catered to.\n\n3. She did not call herself Latino. She calls herself Latinx, but I thought Latino would be less confusing. Guess it just made me look like a dick.",

She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.\n\nMy issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).\n\nI asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.\n\nSince then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?\n\nEdit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked??\n\nEdit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me\n\nEdit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone\n\nFinal edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.\n\nAlso, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

    "body": "Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the \"best unwatchable episode of TV ever\" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. \n\nSo how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the \"removed\" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. \n\nMy cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. \n\nI basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  \n\nThat's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of \"Scott's Tots\" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. \n\nNo amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). \n\nThere is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. \n\nI have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?\n\nEdit: just for my own notes since I\u2019m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.\n\nCousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.\n\nCousin/sister  J, 32: paid.\n\nMe: paid \n\nCousin B, 25: not paid.\n\nCousin J2, 20: in school.\n\nNiece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).\n\nA, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.",

My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.\n\nThis women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.\n\nAnyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.\n\nSo for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.\n\nSo a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)\n\n\"Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.\"\n\nI did not say it calmly.

At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to \"disown\" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)\n\nAlrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. Despite the chain of advice I sent her, she ignored me still. I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.\n\nI had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. LMAO. What a fucking asshole. Glad my sister finally returned to her senses. She told me she broke it off with him and I sincerely hope that's the truth.\n\nThis past Monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. According to my mom, she was begging that they do is ASAP, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.\n\nThe future seems pretty bright right now for her. My parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and I think it'd be great for her). She's officially starting next Monday. I'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)\n\nTL;DR: Sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. Delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and McDonald's. Sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. I urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",

We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I\u2019ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We\u2019re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. \n\nThe next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an \u201cannouncement\u201d to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, \u201cNope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It\u2019s my day. Thank you for understanding.\u201d and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nFlash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens!

He\u2019s been my best friend for a long time and we\u2019re so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. \n\nI had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He\u2019s really goofy with me, and treats me like I\u2019m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he\u2019s family. \n\nA couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I\u2019m in the right place in life and I\u2019m so happy. \n\nWhen James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won\u2019t go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn\u2019t feel like going to the mall, can\u2019t come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. \n\nMy mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said \u2018I know it\u2019s really weird of me but it just creeps me out\u2019 \n\nI found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. I\u2019m so upset that he\u2019s ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! I want to reach out but I just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the one that\u2019s being difficult or if it\u2019s him.",

I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. \n\nI was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, \"aww that's sweet of her.\" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. \n\nOne of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. \n\nSo I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, \"That's not okay.\" \n\nNow I feel like absolute shit.

It\u2019s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she\u2019ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it\u2019s a multi day hike). \n\nIt made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.\n\nNow, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It \u201cfeels like\u201d 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren\u2019t connected to an endless supply of water.\n\nThey were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I\u2019ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. \n\nThey had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl\u2019s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way.

Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and I did.\n\nI overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a \"hot list\" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing this morning, and now I feel terrible.\n\nI hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn't think they should be fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person who reported them, and I've overheard people say that the person is a \"snitch\".

I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I hate that I even have to write this\n\n**ETA: wow this is just about the most toxic thing that has ever happened to me.

I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.\n\nNow, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine.

I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.\n\nHere's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. \nWe both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.\n\nTheir relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. \n\nOn an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.\n\nMy mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently.

However, she still expects me to take on all the duties of a bridesmaid. I told her that was ridiculous and that she needed to find a new bridesmaid.

I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.\n\nNow, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.\n\nShe's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money.

When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left.

I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. \n\nThey get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don\u2019t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  \n\nI used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn\u2019t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. \n\nEven though I\u2019m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She\u2019d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. \n\nFor the last six months I\u2019ve been having my 30 mins \u2018meditating\u2019 out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have \u2018meditative time\u2019 and it\u2019s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. \n\nI recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and \u2018ruining it\u2019 for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I\u2019m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",

She had 3 kids from a previous marriage, an 18yo girl 17yo boy and 15yo girl, I am 18 so I'm the same age as the oldest, but I'm older by a couple months. At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm \"not one of them\" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  \n\nMain problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.  My step siblings have had a problem with going into my room cause I keep my stuff organized and I\u2019m the only one with a tv in my room (I paid for it). And they watch tv, I usually just let them to avoid talking to them.   I have a mini memorial of my mom in my room that has a plaque of my mom and her urn.  It\u2019s not much but I like it, I guess all 3 were watching tv and somehow my urn got knocked over.........a lot of the ash is now in my carpet and now it\u2019s basically just an empty thing.  When I got home I flipped my shit, it got bad enough that my dad came into my room and sent them out.  When I told him what happened he said that he\u2019s sorry and that he will talk to him.  (This is where I may be the AH) my dad said something about never being too mad at \u201cfamily\u201d.  I had enough and told him exactly this \u201cthey aren\u2019t my family, they have made home life shit for years and now knocked over the ashes of my mom.  I fucking HATE them.\u201d  He went quiet and didn\u2019t say anything and just left my room. \n\nMy step siblings haven\u2019t apologized (not that I\u2019d accept anything they say). I feel bad what I said to my dad but I don\u2019t regret a word of what I said.  AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards!!! \n\nEdit 2: when I was 7 I did something really stupid and put the plastic bag out and poured the ashes straight into the urn.  I regretted once I did it but I was a dumb 7yo.  And the urn has a chip in the ring so it never screwed on right and was wobbly",

Last Friday I get a frantic call from my wife around noon that our son fell off the top bunk while she wasn\u2019t looking and now his arm looks really really swollen.\n\nSo I find him crying and holding an incredibly swollen, red arm sitting on the ground and refuses to let anyone touch it. My wife is sitting on the couch crying and saying how his arm looks so bad. I pick him up to go to the emergency room. I try to dress him since he can\u2019t open his arms and ask her to get the car seat ready. She doesn\u2019t move and keeps crying. I give up and do the best I can and call for my wife to get in...she just sobs and shakes her head saying \u201cI can\u2019t I can\u2019t.\u201d So I drive off without her.\n\nI got really annoyed at my wife at this point. We get to the hospital and they want to run him through some X-rays and he\u2019s screaming bloody murder. Around 3pm I get a call from my daughter\u2019s school saying that no one\u2019s picked her up (my wife\u2019s job) so I call my wife. No one picks up. I call 3-4 more times before I rush out to the school. My son was inconsolable at me leaving him. Even the doctors were confused why I had to leave so soon. \n\nI get home with my daughter and rush in to find my wife STILL CRYING on the phone to her sister. I absolutely let loose and yelled \u201cwhere the FUCK were you??? Why didn\u2019t you answer my calls?\u201d She\u2019s shocked and just screams at me back that she\u2019s overwhelmed and can\u2019t handle all this right now. I get our daughter out and tell my wife to look after her. My daughter is crying because mom\u2019s crying and hangs on to my legs wanting to go with me. My wife makes no move to help me so I just ended up bringing our daughter with me to the hospital.\n\nThe next day while our kids were both sleeping I couldn\u2019t hold back and yelled at my wife for being absolutely zero help. She got equally mad and told me I humiliated her in front of her sister (when I yelled when she was on the phone) and that I should\u2019ve been more considerate of the fact that she is really bad in emergencies. While I know she\u2019s not great in emergencies, this was something else and I felt like I didn\u2019t have a partner at all. \n\nNow she wants an emergency couples counseling session to \u201caddress my rage\u201d but I am honestly conflicted.

When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.\n\nDuring my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them \"forget that I was making dumb decisions\". When I spoke to other relatives my sister \"joked\" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.\n\nWhich brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated \"as an independent adult\". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.\n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole here?",

It boiled down to \"This is stupid, will you meet Alice so she can properly explain?\" I try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on Sunday I go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. \n\nShe was cute, my crush was strong, but I managed to sit down with a decent poker face. She pretty much burst into tears the moment I arrived. Lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and I really nearly bolted bc I felt so awkward. \n\nGabby was the one to suggest Alice use her pictures. Alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on Tinder. All of herself... and she was bigger. \n\nI feel really fucking dumb. Still. Alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on Tinder without scaring everyone off. So that's why Gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe Alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if I'm being honest, not that I care. Never did just thought I was being lied to).\n\nWhen I sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. I'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. Sucks to be all those other guys I guess because I'm taking her out this weekend again. \n\nI'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but I don't know.

I took convalescent leave and decided to fly to my home state. I'm originally from CA but stationed in NC this is relevant so everyone understands the time frame for the flight in question. \n\nTo avoid any added pain and to be able to prop my leg up I paid for the entire row of seats. Thank God for miles points. Flying can cause swelling so I wanted to alleviate it for myself as much as possible. When I got onto my flight I sat in the window seat and stretched my leg out across the seats. \n\nWhen everyone else started boarding a couple approached me asking if anyone was sitting next to me. I said no, no one is sitting next to me because I bought out the entire row of seats. So the husband (an older man maybe mid-40s?) asked if they could use the vacant seats because she wanted to sit next to his wife. I POLITELY told him I'm sorry sir but no I need them that's why I paid for all three. He kept at it but I stood firm that these were my seats. \n\nThe called the flight attendant came over because we were starting to make a scene and asked me to put my leg down and not occupy the other seats. I again explained I paid for all three seats and showed her the tickets. She told me while I did pay for the seats I was being rather selfish as it was a booked up flight and said couldn't I just be more accommodating to others. \n\nI was extremely pissed off at this point I mean it was blatant I had a broken leg. I told her no I'm not going up my seats not sitting together is the risk you take if you book late.

It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. \n\nWe decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.\n\nBased on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.\n\nWe've been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more \"normal\" time of day.

I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) \"Andy, Sara, Kate\". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. \n\nThe problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads \"Andy\" and not \"Athena\" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change \"Andy\" to \"Athena\". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't \"get my act together\". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.\n\nSo im basically wondering if im the asshole in this situation.",

We have been dating for awhile now and she\u2019s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn\u2019t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn\u2019t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn\u2019t eat much since she\u2019s smaller but I didn\u2019t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can\u2019t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me\u2019s so often though since she\u2019s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don\u2019t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she\u2019s always making sure I\u2019m taken care of and comfortable.

So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. \n\nNow I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. \n\nI'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. \n\nWhen she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her \"Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me.\" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. \n\nShe cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: When I said \"taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't\" I wasn't trying to be malicious. \nA) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. \nB) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.\n\nEdit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her.

We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle. \n\nOur friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.\n\nDuring our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue. \n\nHowever, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. \n\nMy wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners.

My gf said \"Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me\" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I \"downgraded\" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex \"I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again\". \n\nShe went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?",

I think it\u2019s impossible for someone in my position to see my wife\u2019s point of view fairly so tell me who\u2019s the asshole here. I\u2019m also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it\u2019s solely this topic/argument that I\u2019m interested in hearing your judgement on.\n\nSo my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven\u2019t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.\n\nI still own the same house as then and I\u2019ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it\u2019s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can\u2019t really explain the logic behind it because I don\u2019t think there is any. It just doesn\u2019t feel right to change her room.\n\nThis has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there\u2019s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it\u2019s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It\u2019s therapeutic in some weird way.\n\nMy wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. \n\nWe\u2019re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn\u2019t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.\n\n She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.\n\nWhen she said these things I was really hurt. But I\u2019ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It\u2019s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won\u2019t let go of the past. It\u2019s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn\u2019t my first love. \n\nAITA?",

I\u2019m a firefighter so I\u2019m always on my feet and simply put, I just love foooooood.

    "body": "I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \\[26M\\] gf \\[24F\\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?\n\nI understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.\n\n**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.\n\nHe rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.\n\n**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.\n\n**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, \"in stained shirts and greasy hair\". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.\n\nI think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.\n\n**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",

(e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)\n\nShe texted me asking if I was looking to buy a new bed and I said yes without thinking much of it. She then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).\n\nWe sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and I apologized for starting a fight over something so small. \n\nShe said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. I told her this isn't necessary and that I would deal with it but she insisted. \n\nI've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. \n\nEverything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. The new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. She switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. A lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. \n\n\nThanks to everyone who Pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. \n\nI tried to emphasize this as much as I could in the comments but seriously my wife and I never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. \n\nEverything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on Saturday and it's been going well. Feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the \"honey moon\" period kinda thing. \n\nBut yeah, everything's fine now. To be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion.

So I\u2019m posting here to get an unbiased perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my \u201chigh school sweetheart\u201d for well over a decade.\n\nMy late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn\u2019t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.\n\nWhen I met my current wife she wasn\u2019t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it\u2019s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.\n\nOver the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she\u2019d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can\u2019t she accept it\u2019s very important to me?\n\nLong story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.\n\n I don\u2019t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past.

    "body": "My girlfriend and I had planned to get married on Saturday. We wrapped up all our planning around Halloween, all that was left was to ring some time this week and make sure everything was running smoothly.\n\nShe called the venue and the person she spoke to asked her to confirm some changes she'd apparently made. My girlfriend had no clue what he was talking about, and he reminded her of all the changes that had been put in recently. We had not approved any of these changes. We were able to get some of it put back the way it was but there are some things that we couldn't change back at such short notice.\n\nThe venue forwarded us the emails asking for the changes so we could look over them. Our communication was being done via an email account we created solely for wedding stuff, and the email address which asked for the changes is the exact same address, except 2 letters are switched round. The venue is very apologetic for not calling us directly but can only fix so much of it at this stage.\n\nWe think we know what happened. The whole time we were planning the wedding we got pushback from both sets of parents, and the stuff they had the biggest issues with have all been changed. I'm willing to bet that all of this was related to at least one of our respective parents. We don't know anyone who would want to fuck with us or the wedding this badly except our parents, who got pissy when we told them they couldn't financially contribute to the wedding because they were trying to trade their money for whatever wedding stuff they wanted.\n\nRight now the stuff that we wanted that is still in this wedding is my suit, the venue and the DJ. My girlfriend has gone to pick up her dress and she's not heard from the shop so we're assuming that hasn't changed. I'm calling round everyone and it looks like the menu has been changed, as has the guest list and the cake. We paid for the wedding we'd planned and it looks like any additional costs from the changes (such as the extra people) were paid for by someone else, but they wouldn't give me any of the card info for legal reasons.\n\nWe probably won't be speaking to our parents again after this, unless one of them owns up in which case we'll just stop speaking to that one, but this feels like a joint effort as it's dealt with both sets of parent's complaints.\n\nBefore my girlfriend left to get the dress she gave me permission to post this as we are seriously considering eloping. We have the marriage certificate here, the honeymoon is unaltered and exactly what we wanted, and there's a few appointments we could make between now and Saturday at the town hall to get the certificate legally signed/filed.\n\nHowever, we now have around 200 people attending this wedding in 3 days (our original guest list was about 100 including families and plus ones). People have booked hotels, planes, trains, and are coming from other countries to be here. None of these people have done anything to us and would be getting caught in the crossfire if we were to elope instead.\n\nWould we be the arseholes?\n\nUpdate: I posted in the group chat I have with all 4 parents that someone has been screwing with the wedding, we've found the email they used and we'd be tracking the IP address to a device and location (this was all absolute bullshit, we don't even know how to find an IP address). As soon as I said we'd be tracking the email they all started pointing fingers and accusing each other. It looks like all 4 of them were in on it together. Still not sure what we're doing about the wedding but all 4 parents are uninvited.\n\nWe're thinking that we might elope for the ceremony and then have the reception as planned (it's all the same party/venue and we won't get money back) because of the number of people who are coming from all over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 2: My mother made up the email and her mother helped re-plan the wedding. We knew they'd been meeting for lunch but we didn't realise what they were doing in that time. Caterer and baker can fix the menu and cake, and the clothing is all safe. Venue think they might be able to fix the decorations and the parents have paid for the changes.\n\nThe ceremony itself is the same (we were worried it had been changed from a non religious ceremony to a religious one but it hadn't) so we'll probably just go through with the day as it currently stands, with a couple changes.\n\nWe've decided that we will meet up before the ceremony with some close friends (no parents) to sign the certificate so we're not doing it surrounded by strangers, then have the ceremony and rings as planned with everyone invited, go to the reception with everyone who has been invited because innocent people have paid out money to be here, and then afterwards we will go for drinks with the people who were at the signing earlier in the day.\n\nThe venue offered us security, but we're not going to uninvite the additional people or turn them away, and as for our parents, we're not sure. The options are either invite them and let them deal with their invitees so we don't have to, then cut them out of speeches and just don't acknowledge them all day and after the reception cut contact, or just don't let them come, in which case we will need the security the venue offered because I can't see them just not going.\n\nVenue have also said to pretty much just leave it with them, they'll put what they can back to what we'd planned and they're prepared to offer a partial refund based on what they can't fix (so if they fix 50% of it, they're prepared to refund 25% for the 50% they can't fix)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\n\n**We had a small private thing where we signed the certificate with our closest friends, then we went to the planned ceremony and had a short service where we exchanged rings, followed by a reception.**\n\n**We told the parents that they were not invited, told the venue they weren't invited, the venue put what was essentially a bouncer at the door, and they still got in. They don't seem to understand what they did wrong as they boasted to their guests that \"they planned this, but we changed it to what you're currently seeing\" and their own guests ended up being the ones to tell them how fucked up that was. They were pretty much shamed by their guests into leaving about an hour after they arrived. Also, half their guests didn't show, it was probably about 60-70% our guests in the end, and we definitely had the majority. Food (including cake) was sorted out but not decor, and venue are refunding us 50%, which was going to be 30%, but then they let the parents in.**\n\n**We only spoke to them once to tell them that because after completely fucking up our wedding plans they then couldn't honour one simple request to not come, they would not be hearing from us, potentially ever again, and if they contacted us that would change to definitely never hearing from us again.**\n\n**We are currently in the cab on our way to get drinks with the same friends who were at the signing earlier and then off on our honeymoon.**",

I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.\n\nTo make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.\n\nIt took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.\n\nI'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nWas I the asshole?\n\n**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.\n\nChild services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.\n\nI didn't \"put the kid up for adoption\" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.\n\nAnd I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return.",

Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.\n\nI had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to \"take my power back\" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.\n\nThe problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of \" you can change the worst memories\" or some shit like that.\n\nMy sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of \"oh well if you are not using it i will\".

    "body": "Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. \n\nOn Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. \n\nThis morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would \"confront\" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm \"this is something we're concerned about\" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an \"adolescent sex ring\" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do \"something\" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend! \n\nI guess that's about it...but am I the asshole for how I'm handling the issue with my son?",

The proposal time was a surprise but the actual proposal was not, she knew it was coming for a while but this is where it starts to get a little weird. I got her advice and opinions on the *PERFECT* ring for her. We both make decent money but I wanted it to be special so I saved up about $9000 of my spending money over the years(we live together) so I can afford to have the perfect ring for her. She was pointing out this ring and that ring and these rings how perfect they were, what her ring size was, what kind of cut she wanted, what setting, what band, etc...\n\n\nAnyways I landed on the perfect ring for her, she approved of it, and we were all set just waiting for it to be fitted properly. The ring came in about 3 weeks before the proposal and I made it special and she said yes, excitedly. I'm talking dinner, wine, roses, backrubs, movie in bed, THE WHOLE SHEBANG. There was not a detail I missed, I can assure you I went full perfect boyfriend(fiance now) lmao\n\n\nCue to now, which is now 5 weeks after the proposal, and suddenly the whole style of cut and setting that she wanted for her ring is awful. Apparently she made a HUGE mistake with what she wanted and now suddenly she doesn't like it. I asked her \"Maybe just wait a few weeks and see if your mind changes? You never know, maybe this is just proposal jitters or something\" and no she's adamantly against it. I told her in no uncertain terms that this ring cost me a lot of money and we did research for months(almost a full year) together and I thought her mind was made up. I can't return the ring so now I'm kind of fucked and she's crying and telling me to leave her alone all night tonight. I personally think she's being childish but I called my mom and she tells me that I should have gotten her something she wanted. I told her that I DID get her something she wanted but now she doesn't want it, now my mom is telling me to just sell it for a loss and get one she does want. I said fuck all that, not trying to be mean but I'm not going to return a ring that cost me almost 5 figures just because she changed her mind TWO MONTHS after I bought it and had proposed. I think she's talking to her friends now but idk what to think anymore. Am I being an asshole by not returning it? I could *technically* afford it but this will put a huge dent in my savings and our overall account in general not to mention how stressful all this has been for me.\n\n\n\nedit: no longer engaged, she cheated on me\n\n\nedit2: I'm done guys, sorry for the shitty edit",

The first person I came out to was my dad (40) and he has always been supportive of me. He was 16 when I was born and practically raised me as a single dad so we have an exceptionally close relationship. Anyway onto the story.\n\nMy dad recently turned 40, only earlier this month. He had a huge party and drank a bit too much and was severely hungover the following morning. He\u2019s a freelance photographer and had accepted a contract with a local business and was meant to hand in some photography work he\u2019d done to them the morning after his birthday. He was too hungover to do so, so he asked if I\u2019d do it, he called their office to tell them he was sending his son with the work and I went in.\n\nEverything was fine and I ended up meeting a bunch of people he\u2019s currently working with.

Well, turns out these women then started blatantly calling me for an AH as I apparently let them embarrass themselves by openly hitting on me when there was no chance I\u2019d ever be interested.

My wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. They gave the rest to Jessica. They made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and Jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and I. This was all bogus.\n\nWe made a post on our community Facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. I guess Jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.\n\nJessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. They found it condescending to give Jessica a prize just for having ASD. It was a joint decision between Jessica and her parents.\n\nWe talked a bit and learned Jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an Asperger's Syndrome organization. She's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. Part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as ASD/ASS and hopefully win, of course. We didn't know any of this at all, and I guess this is why the organizers wanted good PR.\n\nMy wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. She's going to help out where she can or if Jessica needs assistance. Things like editing, photography, etc. I guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.\n\nPS: [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/em15ywu/)'s the recipe I used, a lot of people asked for it in the previous thread.

I've learned a lot about ASD in the last few days. I only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. Autism and Asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, I should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",

    "body": "I\u2019m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first child- a little girl!  I\u2019ve known for years what I want to name my child.  The first name has sentimental meaning for me, and my husband and I chose the second name together.  We\u2019ve planned the name for years- when we were dating and talking about the future, one of the things we always said was that our firstborn would have this name.  It\u2019s gender neutral, so it didn\u2019t matter if it was a girl or a boy.  \n\nAs soon as we found out I was pregnant, we started referring to the baby by name.  Because we\u2019ve had this name in mind for so many years, our whole family knows the name and the meaning behind it.  We\u2019ve already started decorating the nursery with little items that have the name or initials on them. There\u2019s basically been no question that this would be our child\u2019s name.\n\nMy cousin\u2019s wife gave birth two weeks ago.  They had refused to tell anyone what name(s) they were thinking about during the pregnancy, which is fine.  But the name that they ended up choosing is pretty much exactly the same as the name my husband and I chose for our baby.  It\u2019s exactly the same first name and then an almost identical second name.  It would be like if our baby\u2019s name was Mary Elizabeth, then the name they chose is Mary Eliza. The actual name isn\u2019t as traditional/common as that, so it really does stand out as being the same name.\n\nI was pretty upset when I found out, because they definitely knew the name we\u2019d chosen and it feels weird and kind of spiteful to use it.  I know we don\u2019t own the name or anything, so we can\u2019t stop them from using it, but it still felt pretty icky.  My husband and I basically decided to just be sort of privately weirded out but to try our best to ignore it.  I sent my cousin a text to tell him and his wife congrats on the baby, and then didn\u2019t reach out any further than that. I didn\u2019t say anything to him about the name.\n\nWell, it turns out that even though my husband and I are trying to take the high road here, the rest of the family is pretty mad.  Apparently, a bunch of them (including my cousin\u2019s mom) have reached out and told my cousin and his wife that what they did is really shitty and that they need to think about changing their baby\u2019s name. They\u2019ve also reached out to me to say that they think it\u2019s awful and that they know how much meaning the name has for me.  I absolutely didn\u2019t ask them to do this, but I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m not happy that people are \u201ctaking our side.\u201d\n\nMy cousin called me yesterday and said that I need to call all of our family and tell them to stop pressuring him about the name and that I\u2019m fine with it, because they\u2019re ruining his and his wife\u2019s time with their newborn.  I have no intention of doing so because A) I didn\u2019t ask them to talk to him about it in the first place and B) I\u2019m not fine with it; I think it\u2019s weird that he and his wife did this and I have no interest in defending him.

It was his dream & I was happy to support him!\nWhen we moved \u2013 to a house a few blocks away from his parents \u2013 we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids.

They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times.

I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn\u2019t add to it. I chose the easy way out.\n\n2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man\u2019s last wish.

It just looks the same to me.\n\nThis is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.\n\nSo i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.\n\nThe professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.\n\n(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).\n\nAnyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! \n\nI got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.\n\nI feel pretty bad.

Everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like \u201cOh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite.\u201d \u201cA plaid skirt. WOW. I\u2019m blessed.\u201d \n\n\nI was prepared for an angsty teen, but I soon reached my limit.

Fuck this!\u201d she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.\n\n\n\nOur parents were a lot less well-off when I was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me.

They think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. I agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. Besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?\n\n\nSister came back to get the markers, but I took them back. I said that she was ungrateful and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. She started screaming at me but I just left the \u201cparty\u201d prematurely with the gift in tow.\n\n\n\nMy whole family is blowing up my phone because I \u201cruined her birthday\u201d. In my eyes, I spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. This will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase.

I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I\u2019m in college.

Dad says he has a new one he\u2019ll give you to replace it.\u201d  She didn\u2019t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn\u2019t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. \nI obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. \u201cThey\u2019re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.\u201d Wtf.\n\nMy dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn\u2019t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money.

We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a \"peak bagger\" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. \n\nFor reference, I am a 5'3\" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. \n\nOn Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. \n\nBF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. \n\nHe told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. \n\nWe've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general. \n\nAITA? Is this just really dumb?",

We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. \n\nRecently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. \n\nI was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes.

There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the \"mom\" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for \"dad\" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.\n\nBut as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. \n\nMy husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do.

I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement.

I\u2019ve always had a great bond with my mother, but she died about two years ago, which deeply traumatized me.\n\nHalf a year later, my dad started to date someone else, let\u2019s call her Elise (32f), she\u2019s currently living at our place as well. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Elise is not a bad person. My brothers really needed someone to cling to and she really takes good care for them. She makes dad smile again.\n\nHowever, she is a lot more controlling than my mom was. I am quite independent, do chores around the house, have friends and go out etc. But she insists that I should follow her rules, to be home at a certain time etc. I don\u2019t like that. I\u2019m used to have more freedom and am actually planning to move out next year, I don\u2019t want to risk losing my friends over her controlling behavior. I am respectful towards her, trying not to pick a fight, but she\u2019s not someone I would want to share me feelings with.\n\nShe also insists that I call her \u2018mom\u2019 like my brothers do but I refuse. For me there was only one mother in my life and calling Elise mom just feels wrong, as if I\u2019m forgetting my real mom. I also feel like if I call her mom I would accept that she has authority over me, but I never chose this person, my dad did. My dad just wants everyone to get along and live a happy new family but is afraid of confrontation and in general just lacks a spine. He also doesn\u2019t like it if anyone mentions my real mom so I can barely talk to him about her.\n\nElise has called me an unruly teenager multiple times. When I got home \u2018late\u2019 she gets angry. Among other things she\u2019s told me at times that I refuse to accept her even though she\u2019s trying, that I am the one thing stopping this family from being happy again. That I\u2019m confusing my brothers by refusing to call her mom (which I doubt). I told her she should accept that I\u2019m not a kid, that I\u2019m still getting over the loss of someone she hasn\u2019t even met.

I\u2019m writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because I want people to see my friend isn\u2019t actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.\n\nI texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don\u2019t live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). It turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. Her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. Like I said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. She\u2019s also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. That\u2019s why she told me she couldn\u2019t pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. Neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when I told her over the phone. That\u2019s also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren\u2019t covered. It turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn\u2019t want to tell us that because she\u2019s already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law\u2019s money. (Apparently it\u2019s her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) \n\nThat\u2019s why her reasons didn\u2019t ring true to me as well. She didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. She assured me she thinks I look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought I look bad. \n\nI know people will question how I can believe her, but I\u2019ve been friends with her for nearly ten years and I give her the benefit of the doubt. We\u2019ve been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. \n\nI\u2019m still side eyeing the plantation wedding but I didn\u2019t tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family I didn\u2019t want to pile on. I do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. I went to the plantation\u2019s website and they do acknowledge slavery\u2019s evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. \n\nI did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and I explained why. She was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. She wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn\u2019t even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. She\u2019s kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times I\u2019ve had to point out something she said could be hurtful she\u2019s always been understanding instead of defensive. \n\nI decided I\u2019m going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. It\u2019ll still be pretty short, so that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s fine with that too except she was worried I\u2019ll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. I reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair I\u2019ve pretty much heard it all. By the time we hung up I felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",

    "body": "\n\nSome background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. \n\nThis is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. \n\nHere's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was \"it's between the two of them.\" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. \n\n\nNow she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. \n\nThis is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:\nNo matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. \n\nI can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as \"enough\" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. \n\nI do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. \n\nBut this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. \n\nBasically, WIBTA if I don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",

I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the \"Money\" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.\n\nLast year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.\n\nWell, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm i being unfair here?",

It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope. When I was 20, I went drunk driving, crashed my car and my right leg was amputated from the knee and I\u2019ve worn a prosthetic leg ever since.\n\nSince it\u2019s March, the weather is warmer now and I had to go out to get some standard shopping so I on instinct wore a jumper and shorts with it as it\u2019s not cold out. On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.\n\nAnyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn\u2019t much people around but there\u2019s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that\u2019s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue. I was expecting this so I was waiting and eventually, a mom and her son of about 3/4 went in line behind me. Nothing was said but I could feel the kid staring at me and he eventually started crying.\n\nI then get a pat on my shoulder from the mom asking if I\u2019d let them go in front of me so they wouldn\u2019t have to stare at my \u201cdeformed leg\u201d and my \u201crobot one\u201d as I was really upsetting her kid.

    "body": "My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?",

    "body": "This is the dumbest argument I've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.\n\nI have a friend, \"Julie\", who has just come back from maternity leave. She and I work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. We were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and Julie asks me about when my husband and I are planning on having kids.\n\nI reply \"it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. Definitely sooner rather than later\"\n\nThen another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. Her name is \"Anna\" and I'll admit that Julie and I don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.\n\nAnna interrupts us and says \"Hubby and I are working on having a baby right now.\"\n\nJulie says \"that's lovely.\"\n\nAnna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby \"Joseph\".\n\nI say \"that's a lovely name, my father is called Joseph.\"\n\nAnna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, \"don't you go stealing my name now\" and laughs.\n\nI'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. I'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because I know about a dozen Josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could \"steal\".\n\nJulie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where Anna just sort of says something to me about not \"stealing her name\", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. At this stage she's getting on my nerves.\n\nAnd then Anna says right as we're leaving \"promise me you'll wait until after me so I get Joseph\", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. Julie and I give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and I realise that she's said I should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case I \"steal\" the name Joseph.\n\nWe all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and Julie asks about my plans for tonight. I say, totally deadpan, \"going to make a baby. The name Joseph is so rare I'm worried someone is going to steal it if I'm not quick enough\" and Julie and I both burst out laughing.\n\nAnna is really really offended. Cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. Julie and I both think it's really funny but I told my sister and she says that while it was funny, I was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. I am now doubting how funny it actually was.\n\nAm I TA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackstory because people are asking: Anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too \"by the book\" and got a bit email-happy with HR early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, CCing in whoever it was about, reporting Coworker X for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and Coworker Y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. We all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for HR. She eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. Me, Julie, Anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed HR in a while. Anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. Anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then Anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. We've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. We're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I know I could have said \"I'm not naming my child Joseph\" and been done with it but first off I'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker I don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that I get pregnant with a boy.",

Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. \n\nThe child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. \n\nUnfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. \n\nUnfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault.

About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table.

    "body": "Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fianc\u00e9 for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. \n\nI confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. \n\nAnd on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll \"make it up to me.\" \n\nI've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. \n\nWoukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?\n\nEdit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t been reading I\u2019ll try and catch up\n\nEdit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from \"Panama\" where she said \"remember, you liked tounging my asshole?\" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.\n\n\nEdit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fianc\u00e9 not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fianc\u00e9 to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",

She would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. The first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. I took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. She replied with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with \"I got tired of listening to your music\". I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and \"threatened\" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing but I gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.\nEDIT: It is my vehicle I pay gas and Insurance. I didn't feel like this was relevant but I digress.

Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. \n\nWhen she did pass away I was surprised she hadn\u2019t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn\u2019t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. \n\nSince I wasn\u2019t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. \n\nWhen I got the ring I didn\u2019t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It\u2019s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. \n\nNow, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it\u2019s fair. I didn\u2019t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?\n\nEdit to add INFO:\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone.

If he had his way he'd only eat french fries and Goldfish. Obviously I'm not going to let him only eat those two things. I'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. What I've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, I'll just say something like \"Alright, I guess you can eat this later\" and put the food in the fridge. If he asks for a snack, I offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, I'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. He carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. He's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did I'd probably feed him something else. My mom friends are horrified I'd do this to my kid, and tell me I'm old fashioned.

It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.\n\nThere is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).\n\nLinda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.\n\nNow, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.\n\nThis now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.\n\nHer face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.\n\nI was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.\n\nLinda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.\n\nAITA for saying what I said?",

In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the \"oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah\".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like \"it's the right thing to do\" and \"she just wants to pay respects\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying \"feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.\" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.\n\nA lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.

    "body": "As I said in my title, last night I sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major I will cease her tuition payments.\n\nMy daughter is currently a freshman in college. She has just started her first semester and I'm the one paying the bill. I have been saving for over 10 years to do this and I am happy to do it, as long as I feel she is actually setting herself up for success. During high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. She took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. I supported her through all this because I thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.\n\nThis last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. My daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. I was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. She is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. Now I know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but I was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. When I tried to get why she was switching all I got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in LA. Apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.\n\nI tried to ask her the regular stuff \"what about your future\", \"How do you plan to get a job\", etc. And she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. This angered me. I'm the one paying for this I feel I have a right to know and not be blown off like that. I thought over it all day and so last night I sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. I am the one paying for her education and I won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. I told her if she doesn't want to do CS that's fine. But she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys AND can get her a career. And if in the end she decides that she's an \"adult\" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. She can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.\n\nThis did not sit well with her. We fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. My ex called me up after and told me that I'm no better than a dictator right now and that I'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what I want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. AITA here?\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, did not expect this.\n\nI have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. Before I say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because I see the same question sent to me and I don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.\n\nI do not have a problem with my daughter getting a LA degree.\n\nIf my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, I would support her 100%. I don't care what my daughter does with her life. I just want her to do something with her life. I am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. The least I feel I can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. I get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. And many of you have told me that I should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a \"academic experience\" to teach her life lessons. For those two last points, I feel you are wrong.\n\nThis money that I have saved is not a \"gift\". This is what I have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. This is my investment in her. For people who claim that I should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, I respectfully disagree. Giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing I could do for her right now. Supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. And the fact that she seems to think that I am owed no explanation and that I should \"mind my own business because she's an adult\" is an insult to the investment I am making in her.\n\nI am not arguing whether or not I am wrong. If you all feel I am an asshole for this, then I will accept that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called my daughter and left a message saying that I wish to talk with her about this and that I feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. If my daughter wants to go into LA, then that is her choice. Weather or not I pay for it will be mine.",

He even stole a bottle of painkillers from my mom, and I found them hidden in his truck. When we were married, he was literally doped up all the time.

She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. \n\nAt this point I was just over it.

    "body": "FINAL EDIT AT BOTTOM:\nAs a side gig I teach once a week for a local university. The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors, so college work is not new to them. \n\nThis semester I have a student who just has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can\u2019t be turned in late for full credit \ud83d\ude44 The students are also allowed to redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it\u2019s a required assignment to pass the course. \n\nShe shows up exactly on time or 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she\u2019s been 2-3 minutes late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I\u2019ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm evaluation. \n\nShe missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass. She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn\u2019t historically been an issue. \n\nHer course professor had a conversation with her in class last week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there, dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said \u201cYou are late and you are not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.\u201d \n\nSo, my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance to make it up and it\u2019s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can\u2019t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very justified in sending her home. She\u2019s been given several warnings and multiple breaks with late work. But now I\u2019m feeling kind of like I might have been an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I\u2019ve let her stay when she was late in the past. What do you think, Reddit?\n\nEDIT:\nI\u2019ve had a few comments where I\u2019ve addressed this and it should probably be added to the original post. \n\nI did discuss her tardiness with her several times. At the beginning of the term she was 2-3 minutes late every day. At first I said \u201cBe careful of your time!\u201d Then a more stern \u201cWe start on time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.\u201d But I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments. The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be sent home.\n\nEDIT 2:\nHoly cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to go see a movie and this is exploding!! I\u2019m trying really hard to catch up on reading everyone\u2019s comments and answer questions. Bear with me if you posted a question, I\u2019m trying to weave me way through this thread. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a few comments and gotten a bunch of dm\u2019s calling me a misogynistic pig. I\u2019m a female. This student being a female had zero to do with my decision. Last term I had a male student who behaved similarly and nearly failed, but finally got his shit together and showed up on time. I don\u2019t care what their gender is, just do your freaking work. \n\nAnd for the people saying I\u2019m TA because why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents, students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group to present each patient\u2019s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I\u2019ve told my students it\u2019s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came in late and wasn\u2019t dressed.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn\u2019t expect this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most frequently asked questions here. \n\nYes, I did attempt to find out what was going on in her personal life. I\u2019m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would have been willing to help her in any way I could if she\u2019d given me anything I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there. So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what I should have done. \n\nShe did not fail because she was late for class. She had a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3 months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from not completing a required assignment. \n\nI do not know if she has ADHD. I will keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. \n\nI have requested that the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late assignments. It\u2019s not my syllabus to write. I don\u2019t teach in the classroom. \n\nDue to a lot of comments I\u2019ve read, I now realize that I need to be more of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn\u2019t doing anyone any favors trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning. Second time I will send them home. \n\nThank you everyone for your feedback! I really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home. I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment. But you\u2019ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted. It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future.",

    "body": "My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. \n\nShe recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.\n\nWe talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.\n\nBefore this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.\n\nThey (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the \"this is probably why she cheated!\" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?\n\n**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said \"we talk every month\" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the \"entire\" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. To the mods, I'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. I'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",

My sister reached out to me the day of the proposal and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I was ecstatic about. My sister and I are very close, so she said it would be really meaningful to her if I was in the wedding party. I\u2019m really excited for her, and I feel great that she values me enough to give me a spot. \n\nHer and her fiance have been on top of planning everything to avoid stress and pushing things off to the last minute. One of the things they already have picked are the venue and catering. I asked my sister about food options knowing there will likely only be a couple of dishes we can eat, but she told me there won\u2019t be any options for us. Now I\u2019m used to picking from a few side dishes, so I wasn\u2019t expecting a lot, but my sister knows I\u2019m vegan and knew it well before she got engaged. Apparently even the vegetables are going to be very buttery, so we can\u2019t even eat those. I don\u2019t expect a whole vegan friendly wedding, but I\u2019m sure at least one option couldn\u2019t have hurt. \n\nI asked my sister about including at least one thing for me, and she just told me I was probably going to have to find something else to bring in to eat or that I should eat before the wedding so I won\u2019t be hungry when everyone else sits down to eat. Like what? \n\nThis honestly would not be a huge deal if I was going to someone else\u2019s wedding who I wasn\u2019t very close to, but my sister stressed and emphasized so much about how important it was to her that my boyfriend and I be there, then she won\u2019t bother to make sure we can actually eat anything then tells me to just bring something else in while everyone else is catered to. \n\nI understand it\u2019s her wedding. She has enough on her plate already, and I won\u2019t try to make her change the menu for us, but we both feel hurt that we\u2019re just being tossed to the side and told to fend for our own food.\n\nEdit: A piece of info that I did not include is that my parents keep kosher, and they are being provided with options.",

I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.\n\nLast week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\nToday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nWhen I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?\n\n**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nBut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

    "body": "My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is \"easy\" and not \"really that hard\". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.\n\nSince then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:\n\n1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.\n2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.\n3. While playing one of his games, I told him his \"baby\" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.\n4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him \"You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you.\" He has not gone anywhere in a week.\n5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.\n\nAfter his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.\n\nHis mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.\n\nTell me the truth; Am I being too much of an asshole here?",

I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. \n\nShe came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more \"appropriate\" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.\n\nFor her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.\n\nLunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. \n\nSo I explained that she shouldn't share \"spicy\" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send \"age appropriate\" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.\n\nI called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is \"a little kid\" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating \"adult food\" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said \"No\" and \"This really shouldn't be a big deal.\"\n\nThis might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. \n\nJust to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and \"Are the other kids making fun of you?\" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. \n\nSo AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?",

R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told \"this is important\", or \"i need to hear this\". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.\n\nit drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.\n\nshe's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.\n\nEdit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.\n\ni always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again\n\ni can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.\n\nI've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.\n\nafter thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",

    "body": "My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.\n\nMy husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our \u201creal\u201d one. \nWe were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.\n\nThe bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. \n\nOur villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. \n\nWe have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. \n\nWell, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to \u201cslave\u201d and live as \u201cpeasants\u201d while their grandchildren get a nicer room. \n\nThis is bora bora we\u2019re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. \n\nThere was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would\u2019ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would\u2019ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.\n\nI obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn\u2019t one just sit back and be grateful they\u2019re on a free vacation instead of complaining?\n\nMy grandparents freaked out. Saying I\u2019m holding money above their head and that I\u2019m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. \n\nIdk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it\u2019s falling apart. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole at all, but I\u2019ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. \n\nSo Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?\n\n\n\n***UPDATE***\nEven though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it\u2019d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.\n\nDuring breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we\u2019re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. \n\nI made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn\u2019t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. \n\nThey kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. \n\nWell, I\u2019m not doing that. \nI\u2019ll pay for their flight back home, but I\u2019ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. \n\nSo there you have it. My grandparents weren\u2019t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. \n\nAfter breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn\u2019t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. \n\nStaff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn\u2019t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words \u201cthey kill the vibe\u201d. So everyone\u2019s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. \n\nI\u2019m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. \n\nI have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can\u2019t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. \n\nI did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. My dad is also an entrepreneur, I looked up to him and am so glad I had him as an inspiration who paved the way. Don\u2019t give up on your dreams.",

    "body": "My partner and I bought a house this summer, and for Thanksgiving we\u2019re hosting my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law (SIL), and her husband. SIL is due with her first baby at the end of February.\n\nThe plan is to have parents (in their late 60\u2019s) sleep in our guest bedroom on a proper frame and mattress. That leaves our office, with an air mattress (a decent one, but still) for SIL and her husband. \n\nLast time SIL visited overnight a few months ago, we had other guests already staying in the guest bedroom for several weeks and felt it would be a lot to have them move all their personal items, so we gave her the air mattress again.  She made a big deal about how pregnant people should get priority sleeping arrangements, even if it means uprooting someone for a night. She recently mentioned to my partner that maybe she and her husband should take our master bedroom when they come in a few days for the holiday.\n\nI\u2019ve never been pregnant, and I can respect that maybe you just want some damn comfort as you grow a human. However, I think my judgment may be clouded by my annoyance that she historically makes a stink about getting what she wants, pregnant or not. Further, I currently live long-distance from my partner, and I am only home for the week. I just want to enjoy the visit, appreciate the home we\u2019ve bought AND sleep in my master bedroom, dammit. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of your suggestions and reality checks. I really liked the suggestion from /u/lizard_windowpane to leave it to the in-laws in a group chat to determine who sleeps where. Realistically, it feels a bit late in the game to insinuate via text that SIL would be better off not showing up, so my partner and I have decided to put our nice comfy mattress into the office for SIL and rock out on the air mattress in our room for the visit. Is it a perfect solution? No, but SIL and elder in-laws get much-needed comfort, we keep our room. Hopefully next year, we\u2019ll just be guests!",

    "body": "Hi AITA. I am going to try to make this as brief as possible so I don't ramble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dated Em for a year and a half. During this time I confided in her some personal secrets, which I don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. Because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that I am very sensitive towards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. I broke up with her because I found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. Recently I found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. She basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information I shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. She replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. That was the last straw for me, and I sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that \"this is what Em sends me when I ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer familly is quite religious and they lost it. Apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. I sent them to her family. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Well this blew up. I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",

I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.\n\nMy manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it\u2019s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.\n\nThere is no way to prove there wasn\u2019t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn\u2019t put liquor in that shot.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t and didn\u2019t care enough to argue with her about it. I\u2019m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.\n\nI trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don\u2019t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.\n\nI told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I\u2019m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it.

It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! \n\nMy fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. \n\nSurprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.\n\nThe phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. \n\nLess than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.\n\nShe sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. \n\nFor days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. \n\nMy fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! \n\nTLDR: We are eloping, bitches!\n\nEdit; Since everyone here has become a dictionary for the word \"elopement\", take it however you like. Small wedding/elopement, I don't care. I'm marrying the love of my life in the way I want, so, I won either way \ud83d\udc4d",

I am Latina, but third generation, but I guess I must look very racially ambiguous because I get a lot of questions and guesses. That being said, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad KNOWS I\u2019m Latina. He\u2019s met my parents, and he\u2019s asked before. \n\nEver since we announced our engagement, his moms been very involved in planning so we\u2019re around his parents a lot more often. FIL has asked NUMEROUS times \u201cwhat are you again?\u201d Or \u201cyou\u2019re (insert random race of brown people) right?\u201d And other variations. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it but it happens SO often that I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s on purpose. My fianc\u00e9 and his mom seem to not think much of it, or they\u2019ll just laugh it off as if he\u2019s joking or implying it\u2019s funny that he\u2019s \u201cforgotten\u201d again. This seriously happens like once a week I wanna say. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve just started \u201cjoking\u201d back and either confirming I\u2019m whatever he thinks I am that day, or I just tell him something random. My fianc\u00e9 thought it was funny at first but has now changed his mind and thinks I\u2019m being disrespectful. I think it\u2019s his dad being disrespectful, and I\u2019m dealing with it in a funny lighthearted way. AITA\n\nEDIT: I meant ethnicity not race! Sorry!\n\nANOTHER EDIT: guys... it\u2019s okay! I think this has gotten out of hand. My future FIL is being annoying at worst, it might have racial undertones but he\u2019s a normal decent guy who treats me well outside of all this, not some sort of hateful racist monster. I assumed the fact that I\u2019m able to joke back to him about it implied that this is honestly all in good fun, just because it has some serious undertones doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s some sort of relationship ending catastrophe. If it helps, imagine he was calling me by the wrong name and I gave him a fake one each time. It\u2019s not as racially charged, but it\u2019s honestly about the same energy behind it if that makes sense. I\u2019m engaging in this discussion and getting into the racial implications because I genuinely find it interesting and fun, but it really doesn\u2019t have to be as serious as it\u2019s gotten.

Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group\u2019s conversation moved along. \n\nYesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn\u2019t think too much about it because it\u2019s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.\n\nA few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn\u2019t buy it because it wasn\u2019t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I\u2019m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I\u2019m skinnier. \n\nTo be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn\u2019t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn\u2019t answered my calls or messages. \n\nSo I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn\u2019t buy because they didn\u2019t have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",

    "body": "I recently left the house a few days ago. I was woken up at 1 p.m. with a hit on my head by my 1 year old sister and her plastic toy. I had just stayed up until 4 a.m. feeding my newborn sister because my mom couldn't. My mom just had a c-section so she couldn't move or walk for a long time so she is often on a chair. A few hours later, she and I were arguing about groceries (she spent $300 on JUST meat 2 weeks ago, so the previous week, I spent $100 on snacks and household essentials like soap/shampoo and laundry detergent, she wanted me to list everything I bought and was yelling at me when I couldn't remember) and I went to my room in the middle of the argument because I was sick of the fighting. She told me to come downstairs and continued yelling stuff like \"don't make me go up there!\" And I knew she couldn't so I just stayed in my room crying. My dad called me and I explained the situation to him, he said if I didn't like her rules, then leave. Then my 16 y/o sister texted me \"mom said to leave the house\", so I packed. A friend picked me up and I walked out with necessities, and as I walked out, my mom said \"never come back\". My friend dropped me off to my best friends house and at that point, I had cried for like 3 hours straight. That was all 3 days ago.\n\n2 days ago, my 16 y/o sister (who is pregnant and almost due) texted me that I needed to come home to watch my 1 y/o and newborn sisters for 2 hours so that she can go grocery shopping with my mom's boyfriend (1 y/o and newborn's dad, who is just recently unemployed but he's a nice guy) and I told her I wasn't coming back because my mom told me not to. My 1 y/o sister had choked on her food yesterday because I didn't go home to watch her while my mom was with the newborn, then my dad told me to drop my pride and go home just because she's my mom. This has nothing to do with pride, both my mom and dad told me to leave the house knowing she needed me. My parents had always told us kids that if we don't like living under their roof, then leave; we didn't have a reason and were too scared to do it. They must've been shocked when the only child of theirs who grew up without causing any trouble in school, or getting knocked up, or getting bad grades, and always helping them and putting up with their toxic ways, left. I want to help but my mom is very lazy, I often have to do everything around the house while watching my sisters. I'm only 18, my mom won't even take me to the DMV for my permit or license, even though she did it for my brother (the eldest child, he's living with my dad). I'm under constant stress because of my mom and nothing ever satisfies her. I am currently staying at my best friend's house and with my new free time, I can finally go around and apply for jobs and make something of myself. I feel sad but I've been resenting my mom for a few years now, but I always needed to obey her just because she was simply my mom and I couldn't take it anymore.",

I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  I also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that I wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.\n\nI tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk.

Anyway, yesterday was my birthday and to celebrate, my family planned a get together/party. This was all planned over group messages and my sister volunteered to bring the cake. Now, last year, my sister made a \"cake\" for my graduation party which was a spiced vegetable loaf of sorts which honestly did not taste great. I have a sweet tooth so this was a bit of a disappointment for me. I am healthy and I normally make healthy choices so I don't think indulging on occasion is an issue and I was looking forward to birthday cake. I ate the loaf thing then without complaint but it's not something I'd ever want for a celebration. \n\nSo when my sister volunteered to bring the cake,I thought she might bring the loaf thing again so I messaged her separately asking her to bring a normal cake. Or something that actually tasted like cake (ie was sweet) She went on about how this is really against her way of life and what she believes and that if I was truly healthy I wouldn't crave cake and sweets etc but then relented and said she will bring a healthy cake cake. Yesterday she showed up with this block of \"ice cream cake\" which was essentially a block of frozen coconut and almond milk with some maple syrup. I was pretty dissapointed again and after taking one bite refused to eat the rest of it. \n\nMy sister made a big deal about me refusing to eat the cake. She said I was being a brat and that she was only trying to make our family make better choices. I told her that I requested a proper cake and that I thought it was selfish of her not to listen when it was my birthday. My parents tried to gloss over this and told me to just eat it without making a fuss. I was upset and left right afterwards. Later my boyfriend got me some cake. My mother called and said I should apologise to my sister and I've hurt her feelings and that she was only looking out for my/families health. My sister's made some insta posts about \"haters\" and people close to her trying to sabotage her \"health journey\" etc etc and I feel even less like apologising than I did when I woke up...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?

It became sort of a tradition at the end of every hang out, and we kept doing it even after the meme died because we still thought it was funny. Yesterday, I brought my girlfriend to hang out with us since she had never met these friends before. We all went to dinner, talked, and went back to one of my friend\u2019s houses to watch TV. When it was time to leave, I kissed the homies, as is custom, and said goodbye. My girlfriend was not pleased. I had told her that we did it before, but she had assumed I wasn\u2019t serious and was just referencing the meme. It escalated slightly, but I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad.

He raised me and my sister by himself and worked 3 jobs for over 10 years to support my sister and I through university. My dad is the hardest working person I've ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. He was born in a tin hut in rural Bangladesh and came to Canada with nothing and worked tirelessly everyday to help himself out. I am very successful and have been taking care of my dad since I graduated uni and I provide him with about $1,000 a month and my sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. His house is paid off and I paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy about but his place needed major work. \n\nMy wife came to me last week and suggested I stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz I bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. I told her that I want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k I give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. He also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so I'm extremely happy for my dad. The money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. My wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't I pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and I own our condo we live in outright.

All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.\n\nThings worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.\n\nI came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. \n\nQueue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching.

She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.\n\nBefore, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my \"my house, my rules adage,\" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.\n\nLast week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, \"I fart in your general direction!\" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, \"Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer.\" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), \"This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act.\" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.\n\nMy spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize.

My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.\n\nI do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father\u2019s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father\u2019s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.\n\nI have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father\u2019 house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying \u201cThe blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,\u201d and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.\n\nShe then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say \u201cDon\u2019t mess with her,\u201d with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn\u2019t have to.\n\nI told her I was not going to participate\n\nShe asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.\n\nSix years\u2019 worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father\u2019s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn\u2019t my father\u2019s child because she looks nothing like him.\n\nShe turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner.

Not the lying-under-the-table-puking-in-Nana's-shoes plastered, but finding-everything-amusing drunk. I'm not normally a drinker, so it doesn't take me much to get to that stage.\n\nHowever, recently, my brother made the observation that I drink every time he sees me. He sounded almost worried and asked if I drink every day, and I said no, not at all. Then he started laughing and said: what, you only drink when you see us? Huehuehue you couldn't handle being around us sober, huh? Huehue! \n\nAnd I just sort of smiled, and took a sip of my mulled wine and didn't respond.\n\n20 minutes later, my mom comes up to me and says my brother's wife told her I only get drunk when I'm around them because I can't stand any of them. I ask her how my sister in law knows that, because I never said it. She goes away and comes back with my SIL who admits I never said it, but I never denied it either. They put me on the spot so I said it's not as bad as that, I just find it easier to socialize with so many people if I have 2-3 drinks.\n\nMy mom and SIL were like nooope, you hate us, admit you hate us, well fine, if you hate us, fine, don't come see us anymore, who cares, we don't care, you don't care, nobody cares and so on and so forth. It was just a vomit of passive aggression that I wasn't able to get a word in, so finally, when they asked me to leave, I did.\n\nThe only person who's contacted me since then is my brother, who laughed when he spoke to me on the phone and said \"they didn't mean it\" but admitted that he felt it was assholish of me to get drunk at every gathering. Honestly, the other option for me is to not go at all. I'm going because they like seeing me and being with me (despite not liking most things ABOUT me), so I feel like getting a little drunk is the less assholish route than not going at all.\n\n**Edit: yall...

This only happens on weekends.\n\nMonday-Friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.\n\nHere's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.\n\nMy wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:\n\nConcerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.\n\nConcerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.\n\nConcerned the cat won't \"love\" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.\n\nConcerned it's a waste of batteries.\n\nI've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.\n\nSo I did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ULTIMATUM! \n\nI told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.\n\nEDIT 2: Many people have been demanding I pay the \"cat tax\" and post a picture of the real AH in question. Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.\n\nEDIT 3: Hopefully this works...\n\nMy little AH https://imgur.com/gallery/na99l3J",

She hasn't given any specific reason other than \"I don't want a maid anymore.\" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:\n\n- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point\n\n- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it\n\n- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention\n\n- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone\n\nThe woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.\n\nI'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.\n\nAITA?",

    "body": "Throwaway obviously, this is a pretty unique situation so I think my main account will get identified pretty fast otherwise. I'm 32/F/Florida.\n\nSo basically, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry situation, but apparently not, as I'm getting a lot of judgement (some bordering on abuse) from different people and my phone is blowing up. So I want to know if I was out of line.\n\nSo I'm 6 months pregnant, and I've been very open about what kind of way I want to give birth. I've discussed this with my group of girlfriends extensively, along with my family. I ideally want to have a natural, unassisted birth at home, which is near a hospital if things start to shape up as problematic. Now, for this process, I want support, and of course my husband is going to be there, but also I want my two sisters to be with me. \n\nThis is where things get controversial. In my many conversations with friends and family, I mentioned I want my sisters there with me. I do not want my brother there, that would just be weird! But, in these conversations, my trans-sister-in-law was present, and she got the idea she would be included in this childbirth situation. Just for reference she transitioned around 3 years ago. I was unaware of this until last week, when she told me if there is anything in particular she should bring for the birth. I calmly mentioned that I am very selective over who I want in this very intimate situation, and told her than I hope she isn't offended if she isn't there for the birthing. \n\nThis is when things blew up. She lost her temper and I got a torrent of emotional outbursts.  She said that she would never be able to give birth herself and excluding her is taking away from her womanhood and depriving her of her only chance of experiencing this expression of femininity. When she found out my two sisters were going to be there she told me that I was transphobic and she has as much of a right to be there as they do. \n\nAfter this, I received many emails, facebook messages, and text messages from several different people, calling me  transphobe and many other hurtful things. My trans-sister-in-law is very active in the transactivism community (which I fully support), and apparently she told them what had transpired. This has obviously rallied them to harass me, and now I'm starting to wonder if I messed up. \n\nI kind of wish I never mentioned anything about the birthing process to her, maybe I should have just kept all these plans to myself so she wouldn't feel excluded. I'm aware transpeople have a pretty shitty deal in life, and perhaps this added to their feelings of exclusion. But the other part of me says, it's my birthing, I'm going to very vulnerable and exposed, and I (perhaps selfishly) owe it to myself to make it as comfortable and safe for me as possible. \n\nSo AITA?",

    "body": "A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment.

He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them.

    "body": "I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. \n\nAs I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn\u2019t available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn\u2019t available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a \u201cinconsiderate little bitch\u201d. As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of customer service if they won\u2019t help you?\u201d \nAt this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said \u201cI just hope whatever you give birth to isn\u2019t a total c*** like his mom\u201d. The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn\u2019t care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn\u2019t say much (I\u2019m 6\u20192, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. \n\nNow, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she\u2019s ok. \n\nPs, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. \n\nI still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?\n\nEDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment. It was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, I meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn\u2019t even have the chance to get a Kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. Sorry if it came across as pandering. Was not my intention.\n\nEDIT 2: MGTOW go away. Don\u2019t make this into one of your vitriolic attempts to bash women.",

We\u2019ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we\u2019ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.\n\nWhen we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.\n\nMy friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.\n\nAs the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend\u2019s husband with the check. My friend\u2019s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, \u201cI know this isn\u2019t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.\u201d I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else\u2019s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.\n\nI held my shit together because I didn\u2019t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn\u2019t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.\n\nI ended up messaging her and said, \u201cThanks so much for inviting us to \\*\\*\\*\u2019s party.

Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n",

Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. \n\nSo last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. \n\nI thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's \"weird and creepy\" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?\n\nETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. \n\n1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. \n\n2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.\n\n3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. \n\n4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.\n\n5. Thanks whoever gave me silver.",

I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.\n\nWe hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. Compartmentalization aside, I've made some great friendships at work. There are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. They are a big part of my life but I'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.\n\nLast week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.\n\nBut the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in \"such low regard\". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.\n\nETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, \"Ali Smith\". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything.",

The day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). I decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. My wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child.

If you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but I'm mainly here for judgment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am so surprised this post went so viral. I last saw it with like 50 comments and i then saw this on trending and I'm absolutely astonished by how viral this went. Thank you reddit for all of your support and i really appreciate you guys. Im amazed from the awards i got and up votes. Once again thank you so much for your support and this hard time. My wife and i are on good terms but I'm still getting shit from some of her family. She understands my predicament and doesn't hold it against me.",

Lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. \n\nI was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. \n\nMy grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. \n\nMy parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. \n\nI have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it. \n\nI understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",

She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about \"sending it back\" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. \n\nWe go in and find out we are having a boy.

I let her calm down and try to comfort her. \n\nIt's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. \n\nNow that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip.

    "body": "Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.\n\nI came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.\n\nShe's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.\n\nStuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.\n\nI decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)\n\nWife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.\n\nAITA?",

We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.\n\nThe waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. \"How were we supposed to know?\" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.\n\nShe sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.\n\nI told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.\n\nI told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole.

    "body": "I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. \n\nSo when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.\n\nSo she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I\u2019m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.\n\nA couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend\u2019s husband. Divorced obviously followed.\n\nThe only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. \n\nNow if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I\u2019d have no problem paying what\u2019s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. \n\nSo in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.\n\nSo here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it\u2019s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.\n\nNow she has no legal recourse (I\u2019ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",

Usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother\u2019s friend couldn\u2019t afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn\u2019t present during this whole situation.\n\nWhen we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.\n\nThen his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. \n\nI wasn\u2019t paying attention but I took off my headphones when I heard my brother\u2019s friend say no to the lady. She then said: \u201cIt is against my religion to touch men in public\u201d and my brother said,\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not touching you.\u201d\n\nShe looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother\u2019s friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. Just ignore her.\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to ask me if I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,\n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want the middle seat because I\u2019m very claustrophobic (I\u2019m not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)\u201d and she said, \n\n\u201cthat\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I got really pissed and I said it,\n\n\u201cYour religion is not our problem. Should\u2019ve chosen better seats then\u201d \n\nThen she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that\u2019s the last we saw of her. I\u2019m guessing they moved her to another empty seat. \n\nWhen we got back from the trip, my brother\u2019s friend told me he was going to move and I wasn\u2019t right to attack her religion like that.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: This was around six months ago. For those saying that it affected my father\u2019s career, he confirmed that it didn\u2019t. Also his judgement was NTA!\n\nEDIT 2: Wow this blew up!

I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We\u2019re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.\n\nI study justice so he\u2019s telling me how he\u2019s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that\u2019s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.\nHe keeps asking if anyone knows I\u2019m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.\n\nI hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn\u2019t DUI, he didn\u2019t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.\n\nI get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he\u2019s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene \u201cI\u2019m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me\u201d they catch on and can see I\u2019m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he\u2019ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks \u201cwho does your mum think your with?\u201d The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. \n\nI felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he\u2019d taken the time to see me, I\u2019m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could\u2019ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn\u2019t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would\u2019ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.\n\nEdit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I\u2019m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there\u2019s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I\u2019m the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn\u2019t as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn\u2019t necessarily feel like that in the moment.",

On a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. However since we are not used to American portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.\n\nWhen we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. We will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. However occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.\n\nLast night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). When they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. We were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.\n\nWhen we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. He asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious.

He gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.\n\nAITA here? This seems so foreign to me. We still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group?

However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.\n\nOnce inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.\n\n...And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physical\n\nThis makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.\n\nShe takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.\n\nI tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.\n\n>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.\n\nI have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Original Post**\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\n**Edit2: The lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**",

However her ceremony was very small and intimate so ultimately I changed my mind after asking my daughter her thoughts since ultimately it\u2019s her silverware. \n\nAfter her wedding she was asked me repeatedly if she can share the set of silverware with my daughter.

I do like my stepdaughter but it\u2019s not my gift to give away, I\u2019m simply holding on to it for my daughter. \n\nI told her to ask my daughter, my daughter said no. She said it politely.

Friday afternoon, I (34F) had an ultrasound for my 8 week pregnancy. The ultrasound showed a likely miscarriage. My husband (35M) & I were upset, but as my bro & SIL were already driving, we didn't cancel the visit. We hadn't told them about the pregnancy, nor had we told our 3 kids.\n\nWhen bro & SIL arrive they were excited to tell us SIL is pregnant, and due 2 weeks before I would have been due. I tried to sound excited and happy for them but I wasn't as excited as I normally would have been. Then it turned into a nightmare.\n\nShe didn't like supper; so we ordered in food for her. She needed the bed moved from 1 wall to another. Fine. She insisted on 5 pillows to sleep. I found a couple & she was upset I couldn't give her more & asked if she could go into the kids rooms and take theirs. I said no.\n\nNext morning, she freaked out at 7 am that the kids were eating cereal too loud. She spent the morning curled up on the couch complaining about morning sickness. I  sympathized and said it's awful, but it will go away. She screamed \"No, you've never experienced this- they gave me the same anti-nauseau drugs they give chemo patients so shut up!\" I got quiet. My husband was making brunch and she freaked out that he was going to cook bacon because \"the smell makes me vomit.\" We didn't make bacon. She also didn't want us to make eggs or let the kids have syrup on their pancakes. I refused, so she stormed off into her room until mid- afternoon. \n\nMidafternoon she decides to go shopping and said they'd be back for dinner. We said dinner would be at 5:30. At 5:45 they hadn't show up, and weren't replying to texts, so we ate. They showed up at 6 and she freaked out that we hadn't waited so we ordered pizza. She spent the next two hours complaining about how brutal pregnancy is and how it sucks so much and how she's never going through it again. I lost it & told her that I was in the middle of a miscarriage and I'd love to have her problems because it means my baby would be ok. Everything got quiet and she looked at me and said \"I can't believe you'd use the \"M\" (miscarriage) word around me. That's bad luck, and if I lose the baby it's your fault!\" and went to her room and slammed the door. About 15 min later she said \"I'm glad you lost your baby. You already have 3, and if you had one right now, you'd just be trying to upstage me. I'm glad your baby is dead.\"\n\nI burst into tears, and my husband told her to get out. He said \"I've watched you complain, whine and bitch all weekend. We stayed quiet about what was going on with us because we though you deserved a chance to enjoy sharing your news.

She now wants to teach and do Teach For America after graduating. She told me this past week. We\u2019ve talked about this at length and she wants to do this because it\u2019s her new dream job (previously it was law). \n\nI\u2019m upset because if she teaches her starting salary will barely clear 35k in the first few years and we live in a really, really expensive city.

My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't \"take his kids away\" and said he'd see me in court.\n\nThe judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday.

For some reason, I've always looked much younger than my age. I'm usually estimated to be in my early to mid thirties. Gets annoying at times now, but it's okay. My grandmother was the same way. My husband looks his age. I worry about the severe generation gap and finding friends with similarly aged kids, so I try to keep up with younger pop culture and technology.\n\nWe signed our daughter up for soccer this year. We were at our daughter's soccer practice last Saturday, and a mom came up to me when my husband was off getting coffee. We talked, which went well. When my husband came back, she went stone cold and excused herself.\n\nAll this week, this woman has launched a campaign against me and my entire family. She thinks my husband and I have a 30-40 year age difference, which is \"inappropriate\". She thinks our relationship is based on money (?!), that it \"sets a bad example for young girls\" and I especially should \"think about what my daughter is learning\". The team parents were starting to be against me, and I needed to respond.\n\nI was infuriated by all of this. I try to keep a mentality of \"age only means what you let it\" and care for my appearance and stay more modern, but I wouldn't think I'm trophy wife level. I sent a mass email with what I think is a toned down reaction to this woman's judgement and three things: my wedding announcement from 1981, my daughter birth announcement (which showed our ages), and a picture of me heavily pregnant, with my husband, at my 50th birthday party.\n\nThe woman was humiliated in front of all of the parents on the team, so much so that she had to leave because they all refused to work with her at all. Her child has special needs, and this is one of the most inclusive teams. Many of the leagues around won't allow special needs children because they \"can't accommodate\". I feel bad that now her child can't experience sports, but maybe she earned it? We're not leaving this one because it is more accepting of non-traditional families and works best with our schedule. AITA?\n\nEdit: We married so young because we both had very...harsh homes and were in love (still are!). At the time, marriage meant automatic emancipation and you had better economic chances pairing up. We do have more money than most parents of young children because my husband and I are naturally not very fertile. We were essentially dual income no kids for over 30 years. We took an \"if it happens, it happens\" approach to kids and stopped preventing after we both had graduated college.",

I\u2019m mentally crossing my fingers he\u2019s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. \n\nI get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable.

It just wasn\u2019t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I\u2019m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. \n\nI end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation.

She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren\u2019t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn\u2019t a way to move people so he could have two.

The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here\u2019s where I made my offer. \n\nI told the guy, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll put up with this if you give me $150 \u2014 that\u2019s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me.

Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.\n\nShe has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her \"idols\". I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them.

She seemed satisfied.\n\nThe other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.\n\nI know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...\n\nAITA for bringing a sassy doctor's note to school? It said my medical need to be allowed to have a water bottle was \"water is necessary for life\"",

    "body": "Using a throwaway. I am the only child of my parents. They set their will up to have me inherit about 70% of their estate, with the stipulation that I donate/tithe 10% of my portion to their church. My parents' siblings had the rest divided among them. \n\nHere's the thing: I don't view churches to be a worthy cause to give to in general. I actually view it to be unethical to make the churches richer while actual worthy causes suffer. Beyond that, that particular church had a horrible effect on my childhood that I'm still working through as an adult. I can't on moral or ethical grounds give money to my abusers. \n\nThey had another clause where if someone contests the will, everyone's portion gets tied up in court and it's very possible that no-one gets anything. My case extended legal proceedings for almost 9 months longer than it would have been, but I was able to argue and win that the church could be substituted for any non profit charity. I chose Planned Parenthood, RAINN, and Saving Our Sisters, the three organizations that I felt best counteracted the religion I was raised in, and split 25% (15% extra) of my inheritance between them. \n\nI've been getting flak from all of my extended family, who say that I should have honoured my parents last wishes and not dragged everyone through months of court because I \"couldn't control my emotions\". I don't agree, and I honestly couldn't live with myself having given a single dime to a religious group or religious institution. I would have forfeited the entire thing if I had to to not do it.\n\nEdit: The legal proceedings have since ended. The reason that they set the will up that way was that they wanted me to personally have to sign the check to the church in an effort to draw me in. I didn't realize this wasn't obvious.",

Wife hasn\u2019t been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \n\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot \u2014 it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there\u2019s that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she\u2019s wanted. \n\nThe issue is that my wife and I aren\u2019t on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). \n\nI told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it\u2019s practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. \n\nI told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. \n\nShe looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I\u2019m saying is completely fair. I\u2019m not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it\u2019s fair that if I\u2019m the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don\u2019t come home to more stress and chaos. \n\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I\u2019m mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. \n\n**Edit: Well this blew up since I last checked it. I can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. I will read as many of the (4.2K??) comments as I can. I think I\u2019ll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**",

    "body": "Unknowingly to me (M20) for the past two years my mom has been using my social security number to open an account with an electric company and since she opened it she hasn\u2019t paid one bill, racking up over 5400 USD in debt under my name. \n\nI only found out about the bill after I went to check the mail christmas day and saw mail from the company to me. She had hidden it from me for over two years. \n\nI was furious and panicked because I\u2019m supposed to be getting married, I\u2019m in college, and already it felt as though my life was already hitting a block, and now I wasn\u2019t even going to be able to put the power for my own house under my name and my credit would be down the drain if I didn\u2019t do something about it. So I texted my mom asking about it, I tried to be respectful about it, but she threw a fit, yelled at me, and immediately tried to turn the tables on me. She had tried saying that I told her she could use my name, but even if I did, (which I know I didn\u2019t because I would remember something like this) it\u2019s the fact she didn\u2019t pay a penny for two years, since she opened the account. She said things to me like I ruined Christmas, how terrible I am treating her, I don\u2019t appreciate anything she does for me, and tried holding college over my head saying she isn\u2019t going to help me do anything, or pay anything for my college if I try to do anything about the electric. Some of the things were so bad that my fianc\u00e9 said I should delete the messages so I don\u2019t have to look at them whenever I get on my phone.\n\nAfter much thought and consideration, I decided to shut the power off, I gave my mom some time to figure something else out for the power to the house and I\u2019m not sure if she thinks I\u2019m serious or not but I intend on closing the account. She now has basically disowned me, and after talking to my little brother, (He\u2019s 18), I heard how she tried turning my siblings against me, telling them how terrible I am and twisting the situation in favor of her. \n\nMy friends think I should sue her, but as my mother I don\u2019t think I could bring myself to do it,  I told her I\u2019ll take the debt on but I\u2019m not letting the account stay open.\n\n\n\nEdit: Hey all, thanks for the Santa\u2019s last ride. I noticed a lot of comments on this, I want to get to them all and try to read them all. As of now there\u2019s a few questions about why it wasn\u2019t shut off earlier and accrued so much debt,  to be honest, I\u2019m not sure, I called the company and they transferred me to a few different departments such as payments, billing, account services, etc. but most of the workers there said they aren\u2019t sure either and they\u2019re going to look into it and let me know what comes up. As things progress I\u2019ll update this in the future and if anyone is curious as to what happens you can check back. Thank you all for any advice and support given and I\u2019m taking it all into consideration. I can\u2019t let this just slide, the consequences would be too dire.",

We had discussed getting married before a little bit and both said we wanted to, but didn\u2019t really say when. \n\nBoth our families were away for thanksgiving so we decided to take a little vacation, we went to sequoia national park and I thought that it would be the perfect place to propose. I already bought him a really nice watch (he wears one but it\u2019s sort of cheap), and when we were in this beautiful little clearing with the huge trees and no one was around I popped the question, got down on one knee and all.\n\nHe was really surprised and didn\u2019t exactly react the way I expected, he seemed sort of annoyed and upset but eventually said yes. On the drive home he said that it made him upset that I would just propose and that it was \u201ca mans part of a marriage\u201d and \u201csomething he was looking forward to his whole life\u201d.

    "body": "I recently moved into this particular apartment complex because its a lot closer to my work and it has a pretty spectacular gym. The gym fees are built into my monthly rent payment, about $40 and is optional. I elected to pay it because I'm an avid gym-goer. I've been going to the gym at my usual time of around 6:30ish and at first I was oblivious to the fact that during the times that I go, its all women - who usually give me pretty dirty looks but I thought nothing of it. I made a friend in my complex and when she saw me at the gym she was super surprised to see me. Unbeknownst to me, there is a women's hour every weekday from 6p-9p. Now look. I know that us dudes can be big creeps and it can be annoying for a woman to try to get off a workout in peace. But I think that 3 hours is far too excessive. I ended up leaving that day to keep the peace though.\n\nThose times make it incompatible for me to go the gym which is open 6a - midnight. I work 8:30a to 5:00p and I usually come home at around 5:30ish, depending on traffic. Usually I like to chill for about half an hour after getting home to decompress and I either make food for later or just browse the twitter or reddit. Now I know that I could wake up early to go....but imma be real honest and say that I'd rather not do that because I like my sleep. What makes it even worse is that the nearest gym is a 40!!!!!! minute drive away. Which is a no bueno for me.\n\nSo I thought about it and escalated this matter to the strata manager and I asked her about the women's hour because I was not informed of this prior to signing my lease. Apparently its not a policy instituted by the strata, but the tenants (who are mostly women) agreed on this policy as a community and the strata neither endorses nor discourages this policy. I was prepared to give up and make do with the other gym but first I inquired about getting my monthly gym fee waived if I won't be going there. Strata manager said that she can't do that until my lease is up for renewal in a year. So I said eff that, I won't be paying for a service that I won't use.\n\nSo I go to the gym. I make sure to go out of my way to not look at or talk to any of the women there because I want to leave them alone, and vice versa. I just work out and keep my head down.\n\nToday one woman tapped me on the arm (more like hit me if i'm being real) and said \"you know it's women's hour right\" and I said yeah I know that but the window makes it pretty much impossible for me to work out at other times so I have to go now. Oh and please don't touch me. She got pissed and told me to get out. I refused and ignored her and continued my workout whilst all the other women gave me extremely dirty looks. AITA?\n\nEdit: wow I woke up and didn't expect to see this blow up. just to answer a few questions: some people have asked why the nearest gym is so far away - this is because I live in a town that's a satellite town of a major metro area. think Mississauga or Abbotsford or something like that\n\nSome have also asked why I don't talk to the women in there. that's because I agree with women's hour in the sense that I do believe they need their own time to workout, I just heavily disagree with the manner in which they're doing it. so Im not going to the gym to talk to anybody....Im just going to workout. I really make an effort and go above and beyond to not appear as if Im \"creeping\" on these women, like I said I just go and keep my head down.\n\nI suppose I could try to get the policy changed but, again, the overwhelming majority of tenants are women (it was the strata manager that told me this). so I would imagine I'd have a hard time getting my voice heard. You know what, now I know how women feel like when they're in a job or something in which they're overwhelmingly the minority in gender, it can kind of suck.",

    "body": "Edit/Update:\n\nThe moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.\n\nI know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.\n\nI spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.\n\nI have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.\n\nThey agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.\n\nI reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. \n\nI need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.\n\nI don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.\n\nI'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.\n\nI also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n\nThis is the original story:\n\nThis has quite literally fractured my family.\n\nI have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.\n\nMy divorce occurred right after my son was born. \n\nOver the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.\n\nI have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.\n\nThis was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.\n\nAlso, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.\n\nThe major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.\n\nMy older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.\n\nPart of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.\n\nAnd now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.\n\nHe is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.\n\nThis was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.\n\nI'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.\n\nMy oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.\n\nOur Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.\n\nHe accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.\n\nShould I have done all this differently?",

    "body": "Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. \n\nMy girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has \"additional stalls\" at the back of the bathroom. \n\nSo basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says \"additional stalls ->\" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. \n\nWell, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women\"hey there's stalls back there\" to which they say thank you.\n\nMy friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. \n\nI don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. \n\nMy friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she \"sees a different side\" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?\n\nPlease tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. \n\nTL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.\n\nEDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.\n\nAnd to all women, I'm sorry our bathrooms suck.

My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really \"get kids\" so it's often 1x1. \n\nI was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a \"WHO IS THIS HELP ME\" way but in a clearly understandable \"NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO\" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. \n\nAs we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like \"Do you KNOW this child.\" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, \"you're not leaving until you prove you know that child.\" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, \"No mother would EVER say that about her kid\". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. \n\nI was pissed. I told her I don't have to prove anything to her and I'm leaving with my kid. She then literally RAN  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. Cops called. Security guy asks what's up. I was polite to him but I told the lady off. I said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to IMMEDIATELY jump to kidnapping was insane. The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am \"AUNTIE (ME)!\" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. \n\nShe  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the \"THIS ISN'T MY MOM\" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her. \n\nI get she was concerned. And that unlikely I'd adopted a white baby. But also, 100% fuck off, lady. AITA? Would I be if I complained to the facility?",

    "body": "Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.\n\nOn to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how \"At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore\", and \"Taking public transportation is for losers\". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it \"beneath me\".\n\nThe real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. \n\nAfter a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.\n\nSo, AITA?",

She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. \n\nWe traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. \n\nThe day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. \n\nMy husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. \n\nI noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. \n\nSo we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. \n\nTBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code.

They bought two new 2019 cars ($60,000+ vehicles), travelled a bit, etc. But they still paid me the same amount, which stung because I'm covering for them while they went to Cuba and Mexico.\n\nThey can afford to pay me more, so I told them this. I want minimum wage, and they declined saying it's too expensive. So I decided to no longer babysit for them. This means they'll have no babysitter because my friend's husband doesn't care for them.\n\nI know I'm not the asshole for quitting over a wage but it's not entirely that. I'm half doing this vindictively because I know they're in a peculiar position where I'm their only option. But all I want is minimum wage, I'm not going to gouge them over this fact. Part of it might be jealousy but if they can afford $120,000+ in cars in the span of two months, they can afford an extra $24 per shift of my babysitting.\n\nAITA?",

    "body": "Hi everyone.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together nearly 2 years now and have spent a bunch of get togethers with my family in that time. From the beginning, I told my parents that my girlfriend has a serious pork allergy. Whenever a family occasion comes up that involves them cooking, I always remind them about the allergy because they always seem to forget (and my family seems to eat a lot of pork, go figure). Last year at Christmas, my mom cooked the turkey with bacon layered on the top of it despite knowing about my girlfriend's allergy, and my girlfriend couldn't eat it.\n\nSo, since the holidays are coming up I reminded my mom a few weeks ago about the allergy. Today at lunch I was talking to my mom and brought up Christmas Day. She then says, \"I'm cooking the turkey with bacon on top\". I just looked at her and said \"If you do that, (insert girlfriend's name) won't be able to eat it like last year\". Then she got all upset and says \"Fine, I just won't cook it with bacon like I had planned then\" and I said, \"You don't have to do a whole separate plan\" and she got pissed off and said \"Good  I won't.\" She then asked if my girlfriend can eat ham and I just looked at her incredulously and reminded her that no, she can't, because ham is also pork. She just huffed at that and walked away from the table and didn't sit down again.\n\nI feel hurt because I feel like there's an inconsiderate aspect to this by both of my parents not keeping in mind my girlfriend's allergy and me having to continually remind them. I'm mad because if I hadn't said anything today, the turkey would have again been cooked with bacon on it and my girlfriend wouldn't have been able to eat it, which I personally would find upsetting if I were in her shoes and it happened for a second year in a row. I know this isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme of life, but AITA for getting mad at them about this?",

In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the \"1%\" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the \"gold digger\" argument just isn't there.\n\nMy fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. \n\nI am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.\n\nShe has been complaining more and more about how she's \"broke\", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.\n\nI shudder to say \"allowance\", but that's what it seems to be.\n\nI told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.\n\nShe blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.\n\nI talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also. \n\nAITA?",

This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. \n\nRecently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we\u2019d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she\u2019d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she\u2019s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said \u201coh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.\u201d Then she showed a few to me. \n\nThey were those \u201cEarn 0.07$ a gallon\u201d receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. \n\nI was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn\u2019t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. \n\nI\u2019m so disgusted guys. I can\u2019t believe she did this. I don\u2019t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I\u2019m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?\n\nEdit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I\u2019ve worked in for 15 years. I\u2019m on disability through my employer but it isn\u2019t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don\u2019t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can\u2019t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I\u2019m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",

She had heard of me through a friend of hers (Kate) who is someone I babysit for regularly - so when Kate asked me to babysit for Jane and gave glowing recommendations of how lovely Jane was to me (I'm quite shy) and how good I was to Jane - I thought \"sure. I enjoy babysitting, love kids, etc - why not?\" My mother took me over to Jane's house, introduced herself, gave Jane her number and left once she saw that there were actually kids there, that Jane and her husband Peter were getting ready to leave, that it was legit basically. \n\nJane and Peter left and I babysit the kids who were cool kids. I watch a movie, clean up the mess we had made in the kitchen (spaghetti with toddlers is a nightmare!) and chill on my phone. Nothing I do on my phone while I am at Jane's is anything near 'inappropriate'. I do have a lockable folder with some inappropriate things on there (aka anime and manga that are definitely NOT G rated) but don't touch that folder at all while I'm there. \n\nJane comes home at 10pm, checks on the kids, checks out the house and as I'm waiting to be paid, she turns to me and says \"before I pay you - I need to look at your phone. I want to make sure that you didn't take photos of my house or my kids or look at anything rude\". I ask her whether she means she wants to look at my Iphone's camera roll and she shakes her head. \"No, I want to quickly check your facebook, your messages and whatever other apps you have to double check\". \n\nI obviously say 'no' and Jane tells me that she will not be paying me. I call my mother and she quickly comes down. She looks at my phone herself, tells Jane there is nothing on there concerning her and to pay me now please. Jane pays me and informs me I will not be asked back and that she will be telling Kate that I was \"not a good babysitter!\". My mother replies that she will be also talking to Kate about her choice of 'good friends' and we leave. \n\nMy reason for the post is that Jane made a post on our neighbourhood community page on facebook talking about bad babysitters who couldn't accept the parents 'rules' they had for babysitting and still demanded to be paid - and was offering to \"pm\" people more details.

The kids parent never brought in a new epipen after an old one expired and the school didn\u2019t have any of their own so they used my daughters pens. Both of them. Now I\u2019m not upset they used them. It may have saved the kids life. I\u2019m glad the kid is okay. \nToday when I went to drop off new ones for the school and I asked the school for contact information of the parent so I can get reimbursed for the new pens. They told me they couldn\u2019t give me that information and refused to even contact the parent for me. So I produce the receipt and said OK you can reimburse me for it as my Insurance would only pay once a year for them, I do it every January and I had to get these out of pocket. The woman acted like I had aborted a baby in front of her. She refused saying that the school isn\u2019t liable for the use of the EpiPens. \nI make okay money but these damn things are not cheap, 650$, and that\u2019s still a lot of money for us. I\u2019m glad that it was used to save a kids life but I really do feel as if I should be reimbursed. But I was made to feel like a worthless asshole. \nI spoke to the principal of the school and... well I was a little more short that I should have been after the secretary was such a bitch and he\u2019s going to talk to the school board. Currently they\u2019ve never had this happen before and they don\u2019t know how to proceed. It cost me 650$ to replace the set. \n\nSo AITA for wanting someone to repay me for a life saving drug that was used on another child?\n\nEdit: Thanks. I really do feel better. The office staff and principal seemed like I was the worse person in the world. I normally don\u2019t care to much what people think but those stares. They really got to me.\n\nEdit 2: So I just got off the phone with the school\u2019s superintendent. She apologized. It turns out that the school did in fact have epipens on campus but the person in question didn\u2019t know the location of the emergency box, another issue, and used my child\u2019s pens. She said that they would be doing mandatory retraining for all staff and personnel. They would also be reimbursing me the cost. It would take about a week. She also apologize for the rudeness of the staff at the school this morning and that they didn\u2019t follow protocol last week on Friday about informing me that my daughter didn\u2019t have an epipen any longer. \nIn short I wasn\u2019t being an asshole after all and the office staff was for whatever reason. Maybe they were scared that me asking questions would lead to something. I don\u2019t know. I just want to thank all of you. Especially those that gave me information on the generic forms of this drug. I\u2019m going to talk to my daughters doctor about it as in the past I was told there wasn\u2019t a generic. This will really help us save because the damn things are so costly and I make just enough that I don\u2019t qualify for any of the programs to help lower the cost. \n\nThank You.",

I do this when I'm free on the weeked.\n\nMy town's pretty small and the people there are very busy sometimes.

They often offer more but I reject, because I just enjoy working with kids.\n\nThis one family took advantage of this though. I live alone with a few roommates, so this family I previously served multiple times called me and felt that they owed me a special Thanksgiving dinner because it was the least that they could do.\n\nI don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but I didn't want to be rude to their kind offer and decided that I would go. I drove there and we were having a good time eating and talking. My parents called to check on me so I excused myself to leave the room and go on a quick call with them and left. They must seen this as an opportunity of some sort, because the next thing you know they left quickly and left a note on the table saying \"Sorry! We'll be right back and pay you in full.\", and left me with a 4 year old boy and 3 year old girl.\n\nIt was late and I had plans to enjoy my Thanksgiving holiday and they ruined it. I obviously wasn't happy so I tried calling them 3 times but they didn't pick up. I dialled the non-emergency police number and when the officer showed up, I told him everything.\n\nThe parents turned up and the officer demanded their side of the story. They told him they had to attend an emergency community meeting. They were lucky not to get fined, but the officer gave them a strong reprimanding and left. They were confused and ticked off at me. I said \"you should have let me know and you practically left your kids with me without my consent. That's illegal\"\n\nI then told them \"don't expect me to babysit your kids here on out\". They've tried to call me numerous times that they need me and they apologise, but I wasn't having any of it. I told my parents and they thought I was being a little too harsh.\n\n**EDIT**: A LOT of you guys are confused at my contradictive phrasing. **I don't celebrate Thanksgiving**, but you can still celebrate the holiday with your own plans instead without actually celebrating the event. I know some non-Christian friends who decided to go on a vacation to France during the Christmas holidays, that doesn't necessarily mean that they \"celebrate Christmas\". It's just taking a break from all the stuff you usually do and having fun. If I'm making sense.\n\n**EDIT 2:** You guys are right. I ought to charge more. It seems like I undervalue my work and I don't. But with charge rates like that, it's very easy to be taken advantage of. Thank you for all of your insights on this.",

His excuse was I was working long hours and not emotionally available so I \"drove\" him to it. I found out about the affair because the woman with their child came to our home 2 months ago demanding I release him from our financially abusive and loveless marriage. \n\nI guess you could say I ambushed him because I called him and told him he needed to come home.

At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son\u2019s face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.\n\nI did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man\u2019s behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.\n\nTwo months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company\u2019s name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn\u2019t fire him.\n\nThe company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn\u2019t fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I\u2019d reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have \u201cno place\u201d and \u201cno future\u201d in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee\u2019s career is now toast.\n\nWas it right of me to \u201cdouble-report\u201d this guy? I\u2019m sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. Am I an asshole or a \u201cKaren\u201d for not dropping this matter?",

At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.\n\nI know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn\u2019t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he\u2019s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He\u2019s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.\n\nInstead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I\u2019ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. \n\nHe jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he\u2019s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn\u2019t gotten too frustrated yet. He\u2019s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don\u2019t bother him either. \n\nBut anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I\u2019m a massive dick. That I\u2019m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he\u2019s already such a good kid. Now I\u2019m having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge. \n\nSo AITA?",

I wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. He involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.\n\nI was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. I was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. Delivery was a nightmare. The whole process was so traumatic that I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it, for which I've been in therapy for the last four years.\n\nIn my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so I did that. I haven't regretted it for a minute (I do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, I do NOT regret giving up parental rights). I do not think about this child, I do not think of myself as having a child, I am not a mother. I have never met the child and never want to.\n\nLast month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. I told him that we did things according to his wishes and I never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.\n\nHe and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought I'd 'come around.' They want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. I won't. Am I the asshole here? All I have done is what I have always said I would do.\n\nNote: Sorry, English isn't my first language. I also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very US-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as I am not from US and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",

We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. \n\nThe school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a \"normal\" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. \n\nWell, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her. \n\nI just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

Mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being \"anofher link in the chain.\" \n\nThis was about January and Mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and Mandy has actually gained weight. Mandy was using this as \"proof\" that her issue was genetic. \n\nI was helping Mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge Tupperware bin the back of her suv. I assumed she wanted it unloaded but as I moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. I asked her about it. She got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. I asked her if this why she's gaining weight. She told me to fuck off. I texted her husband because in the heat of the moment I was furious she had spoken to me like that.\n\nHer husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so Mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce.

No I don't want to have sex with him. Nor did I ever imply or infer that. Enjoy your day.\n\n\nEdit 2: based on some responses that said I was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which I accept) I called and told Mandy that I was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. She said that I am just another person oppressing her and that even the Avengers were oppressing her these days. I asked her what she meant (won\u2019t spoil the movie) but I explained to her that I was acting out of frustration and Avengers is just a movie and now I was really concerned.

She stores the bottles in the fridge. \n\n\nMy little brother has never had a girlfriend. He acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what I\u2019ve seen. He came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. \n\n\nYesterday, my wife and I, along with our baby, went over to my parent\u2019s house. My brother knows since he\u2019s in our family group chat. He texted me when I was at my parent\u2019s house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. He knows my front door pin to get in. \n\n\nWhen I got home I saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. My wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. Today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. She coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. So, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. She told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. That bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.\n\n\nMy wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. I agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. I thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. \n\n\nI called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn\u2019t wait a few hours until we got home. He said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. I asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife\u2019s breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. I told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. He said he really doesn\u2019t know, but I could hear the tremble in his words. I told him that my wife and I don\u2019t believe him and if he doesn\u2019t apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. He once again denies doing anything so I hung up. \n\n\nBefore calling my parents, I want to know what you guys think first.

    "body": "8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they\u2019ll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it\u2019s name. It\u2019s hilarious. \nI had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I\u2019ll be chatting to someone that hasn\u2019t met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it\u2019s a dead joke. \nWell, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim\u2019s name, said \u201cwhat?\u201d So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they \u201cheard about my joke\u201d and that they didn\u2019t appreciate pranks in a nice family park.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog\u2019s dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I\u2019ll accept your judgement on it.\n\nEDIT: it\u2019s a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I\u2019ll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.\n\nI should have been clearer, but I guess I didn\u2019t know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.\n\nThe truth is that I say the word \u201cAskim\u201d multiple times a day. I\u2019m aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it\u2019s just a thing I call my dog. When going out I\u2019m not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn\u2019t trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn\u2019t even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. \n\nIt\u2019s been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it\u2019s very true.

This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.\n\nBest thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway.

I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating.

We split the bill without any discussion or issue. \n\nHe Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.\n\nI forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied \u201cpizza and a movie\u201d and he replied \u201cyeah see you soon!\u201d It was just an innocent phrase but I didn\u2019t eat that day and assumed we\u2019d get food together.\n\nI show up and he has the movie. I say \u201cso are we getting food?\u201d \n\nHe says \u201cI already ate. But I\u2019m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.\u201d Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.\n\nI sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men\u2019s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he\u2019s low on cash. But isn\u2019t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I\u2019d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn\u2019t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. \n\nHe returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. \n\nI call out casually \u201cwhat do you got to drink?\u201d \n\nHe calls back \u201cDo you like tap water?\u201d\n\nThis is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he\u2019s serious. There\u2019s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. \n\nI call out, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\nHe brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.\n\nI\u2019m starving. I haven\u2019t eaten since 8am. \n\nI say \u201cHey, I don\u2019t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.\u201d \n\nHe says in a sympathetic tone, \u201cOh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn\u2019t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.\u201d\n\nThis is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn\u2019t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. \n\nAfter the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he\u2019s weird with money and I\u2019m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn\u2019t think my pizza was his responsibility. \n\nThen he asks me to have sex with him.\n\nI decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.\n\nI don\u2019t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners.

However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.\n\nAnyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men\u2019s section and women\u2019s section.\n\nMy friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.\n\nShe asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, \u201cThanks for your concern.\u201d In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it.

We talk all the time about having children and marriage when I\u2019m done with school/when he\u2019s paid off all his student loans from university.\n\nWhen talking about the future of kids, he\u2019s said many many times he\u2019d rather have a boy than a girl. Everyone has preference, it\u2019s fine. \n\nSo last night watching a movie about a family w multiple kids, I jokingly said he would love our kids more than he loves me. (I think that\u2019s normal to love kids more than spouse sometimes, and it was a complete joke I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d even respond to.)\n\nHe got a serious tone and said \u201cif it\u2019s a boy I will, not if it\u2019s a girl\u201d.\n\nI told him that if he has that deep rooted resentment towards women and is that sexist in a way, we shouldn\u2019t have kids as that\u2019s not the proper mindset to have nor should gender decide how much you love them. \n\nHe said it\u2019s rude I\u2019d tell him that I don\u2019t want to have his kids now and that his mindset is normal and many men love their sons more than daughters.\n\nTo me, his mindset/ability to only love a boy that much feels like he thinks the opposite sex (women) are lesser compared to men. I\u2019m not easily offended, but this seems like if he had a son he\u2019d raise it the same way, which is concerning\n\nUPDATE; thank you SO MUCH to everyone who commented with experiences, opinions, and different viewpoints than mine! I was NOT expecting this to blow up how it did. \n\nFor those that came to the conclusion I wanted to be told I\u2019m right, I didn\u2019t make this post to be told I\u2019m NOT the asshole, he genuinely made me feel like a nut case for having an issue with his beliefs. I felt guilty for not wanting his children. \n\nI talked to him and told him that I can\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who I can\u2019t have kids with and that I feel doesn\u2019t respect me simply bc I have a vagina. He said he was kidding and I\u2019m being too sensitive and I didn\u2019t understand him (lol). Once he thought I was serious he said he would chanfe. I educated him on why his viewpoint is sexist and hope he changes to be a better man for someone else. \n\nI believe he loved me and we were meant to be together for some period of time but we weren\u2019t compatible when it came to our views on topics like what I posted about. He took it well but was in disbelief I was \u201coverreacting so much\u201d. His idea of this came from his father and growing up he was told women are inferior and having boys is ideal. He said with the break up he\u2019d be going to stay in Pennsylvania with his father for a bit, for anyone worried about what could happen after. \n\nYes there\u2019s a possibility his mindset could change, but I\u2019m not willing to train a 26 y/o to see my worth as a woman. This is a huge deal breaker for me. \n\nI\u2019m heartbroken and so sad as this is the person I\u2019m in love with, HOWEVER, life will go on and I\u2019m better off without someone that doesn\u2019t see me (or our potential babies) as en equal bc of my gender.

I\u2019m getting very nasty messages for leaving this person, but it was my choice. After thinking back to other instances he overall DID see me as inferior and was sexist, I just didn\u2019t think much into these things bc he was good to me.

My fianc\u00e9 has all his groomsmen picked out, and I\u2019m in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I\u2019d also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I\u2019m sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. \n\nI drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he\u2019d be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said \u201cWill you be a part of my Bride Tribe?\u201d, deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E\u2019s ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.\n\nFast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to \u201cfit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold\u201d despite his transition. I tried to explain that I\u2019d picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn\u2019t get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me \u201cbasic\u201d and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.\n\nI guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he\u2019d be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he\u2019s still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it\u2019s best if he isn\u2019t a part of the bridal party. My fianc\u00e9 says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I\u2019m being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming.

So I\u2019m going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.\n\nE sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for \u201csnapping at me\u201d. He admitted he was wrong and it was \u201ctotally out of line\u201d and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party \u201cif I\u2019d have him\u201d. Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven\u2019t sent any response yet. \n\nA also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.\n\nALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",

I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. \n\nI just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. \n\nShe texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. AITA here?",

And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**\n\n**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit.

I bought her doggy door, and she loved it A few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. He eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. That was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. So then the chickens had monitored outside time. Then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. He keeps her locked in her cage all day when I'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. She can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. He's even started scolding me even when I let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if I'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. He doesn't even pay rent on my house. He refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. When I remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. When I suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I think the only thing I can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens.

    "body": "Throwaway because I'm gonna reveal some medical info and some IRL people know my main account.\n\nWife had a C Section about 3 months ago. She was prescribed Norco (Hydrocodone) for the pain. We filled the prescription (20 pills) and then she never took it. She used Motrin and Tylenol only. The pill bottle went into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where we forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Day. We don't want to take an infant around to all our families gatherings in flu season, so we stayed home and invited anyone over who wanted to stop by during the day.\n\nMy wife's sister (so my SIL) Jane and her boyfriend Bob came by. Jane and Bob have been dating for a few months. I never met the guy before. My wife met him once. My point is that I don't know this dude from Adam, but he seemed like a nice guy. They stayed for a while, played with the baby, exchanged some presents, and we all had a good time before they left to go to their next stop.\n\nA few days later, Jane calls my wife irate and screaming. Bob stole the Norco. He is apparently a recovering addict who has been clean less than a year. We obviously didn't know this. He has now vanished. His work hasn't heard from him, his parents haven't heard from him, and Jane hasn't heard from him. He could be on a bender or dead for all we know. Jane went to his apartment when he wasn't responding to her and that's when she found the empty pill bottle with my wife's name on it and called us screaming.\n\nSIL blames us and is beyond pissed, which I can understand. She needs an outlet for her anger. What I don't understand is about half the family blames us too. They understand we didn't know about Bob's addiction history, but they said having unused narcotic medication just sitting around is irresponsible and we created this problem. It's causing a bit of a rift between the people blaming us and those not blaming us, and we (and my mother and father-in law) are caught in the middle because SIL has been on a rampage against us for \"destroying her life.\"\n\nI'm trying to be empathetic to Bob and SIL, but I don't agree. First, we legitimately forgot about it. Neither of us take medication regularly, and we had a newborn to deal with, so we weren't thinking about a bottle of pills in the corner of the medicine cabinet. Second, Bob didn't know the pills were unused. We don't know him and he doesn't know us. For all he knew, my wife could have a chronic condition and need those pills. It's not like he would recognize the prescribing doctor's name is an obstetrician. Am I not allowed to have medicine in my own house on the off chance that a recovering addict will come by and see it? \n\nI think Bob is firmly the asshole here and my wife and I don't have any responsibility. If we had known he was an addict and still left the pills out, then maybe, but we didn't know.\n\nBut, I don't have any experience with addiction or even taking narcotic pain meds, so maybe I am the asshole for not being more diligent about getting rid of the pills. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all. \n\nI'm glad my initial reaction wasn't off base. For those asking how anyone could blame us, scroll down to the ESH verdicts because a few posters have nailed the exact things some of the family is saying. Not so much that it's our fault Bob stole the pills, but that we are \"part of the problem\" that has allowed the opioid crises by not securing or disposing of the pills.",

Though, I have a handicap placard not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.\n\nI\u2019m not asking AITA for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman immediately started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people \u201cthat actually need it\u201d would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn\u2019t know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused me of \u201cscamming the government to support \\[my\\] lazy ass,\u201d among other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she said I look \u201cfine\u201d I told her that my medical history is none of her business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI eventually had enough and let her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn\u2019t eat yourself into debilitating obesity others \u2018that actually need it\u2019 would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she\u2019s going to make assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. He said something like calm down and let's go inside, and I said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. Then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. She either didn\u2019t call the police or they refused to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know what I said was harsh but I\u2019m pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. Maybe I should regret it, but I don\u2019t have an ounce of remorse for what I said. AITA?",

It's been a while since I made that post, and my own conclusion is that I am probably both.\n\nI've done a LOT of thinking about my behavior that week and I've realized a lot of things. This isn't something that I wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like I was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and I had been in a terrible mood. I wasn't acting like myself at all. Instead of coping in a healthy way, I'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).\n\nThe date wasn't really for her, it was for ME, and that's what I'd been trying to avoid thinking about. I was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that I was just upset because this problem had happened before. The truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. I was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.\n\nThat was extremely immature of me, to say the least.\n\nI apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. Because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem I asked her if she had PCOS or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.\n\nWe went to have her examined and it turns out that she has PCOS, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. So yeah, I felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. Luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. She'll be getting regular treatment from now on so I'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.\n\nTLDR; I was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has PCOS. Thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. Thanks for the help, Reddit.",

For some background. This male friend, we\u2019ll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fianc\u00e9 said he\u2019d love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!\n\nThen, I told my parents, and they were like \u201coh we didn\u2019t realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She\u2019ll be in all the photographs, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate\u201d  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren\u2019t going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. \n\nSo I basically told them that if they weren\u2019t comfortable they didn\u2019t have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.\n\nThat was 3 days ago and I haven\u2019t spoken to them. I\u2019m shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I\u2019m upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I\u2019ve spoken to have said I\u2019m being a bit of an asshole because they\u2019re my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t agree with. That I\u2019ll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I\u2019ve had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I\u2019m being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I\u2019m choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won\u2019t be attending if my parents aren\u2019t, and the same for other members of the family. So it\u2019s basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! \n\nMy view is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! \n\nAlso to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I\u2019m not considering either option (my fianc\u00e9 is in full agreement).

I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse \"bulemia\" and \"bullemia\") and gets dismissive. \n\nI've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.\n\nWhen I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said \"Let me guess, you're bulimic?\"\n\nI started to say \"No, I have purging disorder\" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like \"Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand.\"\n\nI said \"No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--\" she cut me off and said \"It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.\"\n\nI said \"IT'S PURGING DISORDER\" because I thought if I said \"no\" again she would catapult me. \n\nShe said \"Okay, sure, \"purging disorder\"\" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.\n\nI'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. \n\nWhen I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.\n\nI said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.\n\nI've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them. I don't know. I think people need to know. AITA? Is it really that bad?",

    "body": "I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. \n\nMy 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. \n\nMy sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. \n\nNow, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.\n\nSo I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. \n\nI am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.\n\nAITA?",

She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they \"sort out\" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. \n\nI am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. \n\nShe went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.\n\nFinal edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. \n\nI feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. \n\nAccusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. \n\nMy daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.\n\nThanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.\n\nAnother edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea.

It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.\n\nSarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.\n\nWe invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.\n\nSarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.\n\nIt's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome.

It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. \n\nApparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.\n\nI hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.\n\nIn the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.\nI hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. \n\nAnyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.\nHe is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. \n\nHe says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.\n\nWIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?\n\nAlso to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.\n\nEdit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.\nJust to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. \n\nFiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.\n\nThis past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.\n\nHe's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.\n\nI know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.\n\nIf I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. \n\nHis main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. \n\nAnd I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. \nSo far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx\n\nEdit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.\nLeaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",

We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.

It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2\" x 4\" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.

She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.

She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me \"I'm getting a tattoo\" instead of asking me.

My grandma (76) before she retired had a high paying job in the fashion industry. She wasn\u2019t a designer or anything or well known on a world scale but she was known within the fashion circles. My grandpa (77) before he retired worked behind the scenes in the art industry so the two of their incomes combined was in the millions. They could provide for my mom and my aunt with no worries but they didn\u2019t grow up spoiled. My grandparents taught my mom and aunt the value of money and whilst the family was effectively rich, they didn\u2019t buy anything designer or any extravagant purchases. The most my mom and aunt spent on anything was buying houses outright and setting up inheritances for me and my cousins.\n\nWhen I was old enough, I received quite a lot of money as an inheritance from my grandparents, a few million to say the least. I put all that money into a savings fund for my future and the most I spent was buying a new car when I was 19 which is the car I\u2019m still driving 7 years later. Then, my mom died suddenly when I was 21 and I\u2019m an only child, so I inherited even more money, our house and so on. I do not buy fancy stuff or expensive stuff. I quite happily shop at stores where the general public go as I don\u2019t need extravagant designer labels to be happy. I also don\u2019t really talk about my finances as it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\n\nAbout two months ago, I had a few friends over and by sheer \u201caccident\u201d (I use that lightly), two of them found one of my bank statements. It was upstairs in my bedroom so I no for a fact they were snooping. I was pissed at them and I had to reveal my finances when they saw how much money I had. They were annoyed I didn\u2019t tell them and I said it\u2019s none of their business.\n\nNow, I have a problem. It\u2019s one of their birthdays soon and they want a HUGE party. I said that was cool and then they dropped a bombshell saying I should pay for it as I\u2019m loaded. I was greatly offended and said why would I pay for someone\u2019s party. It\u2019s caused a massive rift with people accusing me of being selfish and hoarding all this money which I\u2019m probably never going to touch. I told them that that\u2019s MY money and I\u2019m saving it for my future and any future family I may have and I\u2019ve been labelled an AH.\n\nUpdate: someone mentioned maybe my friends suspected that\u2019s why they were snooping. Maybe they had questions after I got a lot after my mom died. I never disclosed anything to them as it was private but it was hard to hide I had a whole house I owned suddenly. I also am able to work a lot less hours than them so maybe they\u2019ve always wondered how ibe managed to survive on a \u201clow income\u201d\n\nUpdate 2: I should add my grandparents are still alive. The inheritance I got from them was money they\u2019d saved for me for when I was of age.\n\nUpdate 3: to those saying I\u2019m an AH for my views on marriage. I would NEVER get a joint bank account. I think it\u2019s only fair you both hold onto your money, don\u2019t share and the only time technical sharing should come up is if you\u2019re both paying half of whatever. Also I don\u2019t ever wanna get married to those who decides to berate me for my view on marriage and getting offended why I didn\u2019t have a reason for not wanting to get married. I also don\u2019t understand why people are getting so annoyed that I wouldn\u2019t share my money with an SO. The simple reasoning for that is I do not want an SO or a life partnership. I\u2019m content remaining single. I also would like a future family one day not that I need to mention that and will probably go the adoption or donor dad route.\n\nUpdate 4: I also checked my bank accounts and changed my security up as a precaution so nothing was taken. As for the paper statements, I am one of the few people who does like to have paper copies of my accounts. And yes, I do plan on cutting these friends out. I just wanted some honest to god insight into this situation as it\u2019s incredibly frustrating and on another level, I\u2019m losing most of my friends I\u2019ve known for years so it\u2019s really upsetting me.\n\nUpdate 5: it was also brought up why I never disclosed I was this well off to my close friends. Yes I could have told them and never mentioned exact figures but that info is deeply private. They never mentioned their situations and I never thought to ask as finances are nobody\u2019s business but your own. I have no obligation to tell anyone how much money I have or how well off I am.",

The problem is that she has a very credulous nature while I am much more skeptical. Around six months ago my wife got a call from the MVA telling her that my new car wasn't ever registered, and that I would be arrested if she didn't pay the registration fees immediately. \n\nShe went to the store and bought a bunch of prepaid giftcards and gave the numbers to the scammers over the phone. When she told me what happened I explained that this was a scam, the MVA would not have someone arrested for messed up paperwork, nor would they accept prepaid gift cards in payment. I contacted the bank and they said there was nothing they could do, the company issuing the cards said the money was already gone. Needless to say this was an expensive lesson, but I thought my wife at least wouldn't fall for something like that again.\n\nLast week she fell for the IRS scam, she was contacted and told that we made an error on our 2018 taxes and that we owed the IRS $2500. They threatened jail time, taking our house, our cars, etc. My wife panicked and gave the scammers our joint account information. She called me after she did this and I immediately hung up and called our bank. They said we had a large transaction pending, but since it was the same day they could stop it. \n\nQuite simply, after going through this the first time I cannot believe that she fell for another scam, the first time was such a nightmare and so many emails and phone calls. She refused to deal with it so it was me who was calling our bank, calling the prepaid card company, sending emails back and forth trying to get our money back. She said she felt overwhelmed by the situation and didn't want to deal with it, and now I'm forced into this same situation again through her negligence. Would I be wrong to ask for separate finances at this point, I don't feel secure knowing my money is in her hands.",

She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. \n\nAfter months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. \n\nA few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again \"I love you). \n\nAt the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again \"I love you.\"\n\nAfter the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said \"I love you, Anna.\" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time. \n\nAITA for this?",

We split when Alex was a year old, and we decided I'd have primary custody because he moved in with a bunch of roommates, but he asked to have Alex every other weekend.\n\nWell, Josh paid child support, but he kept making excuses every weekend as to why he couldn't have Alex overnight (roommates having a party, his friend needed help moving, roommates having guests, his sister was in town, etc.) and after the first six months or so, I just stopped bugging him about it and he just stopped even making excuses. He didn't see Alex at all from ages 2-4.\n\nLast year, his roommate situation changed, he distanced himself from his toxic friend group, and his parents were putting pressure on him, so Josh asked if he could have Alex for one weekend a month. After setting up some playdates to make sure Alex was comfortable with him (since he was basically a stranger at this point), we went ahead with that plan. And it's been great, Alex loves his dad and they have a great time together, and Josh expressed interest in having him over more weekends now. It's also been nice to have some 'time off' being a single mom. Great. Good news.\n\nExcept... I'm not a big social media person, but I checked Facebook in December and noticed that Josh has been posting a lot of pictures of Alex over the last year... and he never indicated that Alex was his son. He keeps calling him his 'friend' or 'his little buddy.' Someone even asked who Alex was and he said, \"He's my little bud!\" Something about this rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like I've been incredibly 'chill' about this process, maybe moreso than I should have, but the fact that he isn't even claiming Alex as his son is really shitty. I was worried he wasn't even telling his friends that this was his kid.\n\nSo, next time he posted Alex, I commented basically saying, 'I'm glad Alex is having a great time with his dad!' and proved my hypothesis; everyone was like, 'You have a kid???' 'This is your kid???' 'You never mentioned having a kid!'\n\nJosh was furious at me, deleted the post when he saw it, and basically said it's his business to tell his friends and social circle about his life. My sister also said I was being petty, but she said I have an excuse because he's been so absent. Was it an asshole move to 'out' him like this?\n\nEDIT: Just want to note a couple of things here. Our son was planned. He wasn't an 'oops' baby that Josh didn't want or didn't know was coming. I think people saying that he needs time to 'get used' to being a father should keep that in mind. \n\nAlso, he and Alex have now been spending weekends together alone since last July, and had been hanging out with me present since April of last year, if the timeline wasn't clear. This isn't the first few weeks of their reacquaintance.\n\nEDIT #2: I am 28 and Josh is 29. We are almost 30.

At least until yesterday. A email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with \"attendance requirements\". These requirements were a joke. Some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the \"gift requirements\". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with \"Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. I called my mom to make sure this was not a late April fools joke and it was real. I told her that I won't be going because of this. That was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that I'm being selfish and that i'm ruining \"her day:. My parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. My parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but I still think that all of these rules are a joke.\n\nWould I be an ass if I skipped out on the wedding?",

    "body": "My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.\n\nAn stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of\u2013 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.\n\nWhen An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.\n\nMy husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.\n\nI laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.\n\nAn's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of \"all the experience\". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.\n\nI am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of \"terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition\", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.\n\nMy husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).\n\nNo, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.\n\nI will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.\n\nFinally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.\n\n**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the \"natural\" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.",

    "body": "Throwaway and not English, so keep that in mind.\n\nI will try to keep this short\n\nMy girlfriend recently asked to move in with me since her lease was running out and the landlord did not want to renew it and given she makes a little above minimum wage in my country finding a rental place is semi impossible for her(If you make minimum wage or on welfare government rental housing is available if not and you are between minimum wage and middle wage you are screwed.), so it was move back to her parents or move in with me. While I was reluctant given we have only been together for a year, I love her and let her move in. I inherited money from my uncle which I used to buy my own house.\n\nIt has been going really well, until yesterday when she asked me if her best friend could move in for a while. Now this best friend of hers is a mess to put it bluntly, she can hardly keep a job, drinks enough to pass out at least once a week, smokes weed inside, got kicked out of her place for not paying rent etc. So obviously my answer was no, she retorted by saying it would just be fir a few weeks, to which I said even if it was fir a day it would be a no, she got mad saying I did not care about her friend and I shrugged andagreed saying I indeed do not care about her friend, she us her friend not my friend.\n\nWell this turned in to a huge fight where she tried to have me sleep on the couch, I told her I was not sleeping on the couch in my own home and if she wanted to sleep somewhere else, she is welcome too.\n\nToday I went to work and she had the day off, our argument was unresolved but she was still asleep so I did not feel like waking her up and arguing. When I got home 9 hours later I see a load of suitcases in the hallway, confused I walk in to the living room and ammet with her, her best friend and her best friends boyfriend. Her best friend immediatly comes over to thank me for letting her move in and so does the boyfriend.\n\nI take a moment, glare at them and tell them to grab their shit and get out, after some whining they comply. My girlfriend calls me a horrible person and that they have no where to go and I tell her to join them and after a lot of arguing she grabs her stuff and gets out too.\n\nI have since gotten multiple messages from mutual friends calling me horrible for making my girlfriend and her friend homeless so I am doubting my decision, I have plenty of room after all. Judge me. Also yes, I dumped her, before anyone asks, I am just wondering whether I overreacted and such.\n\nEDIT: I should have done this earlier but I got overwhelmed by the amount of responses. So to answer some frequently asked questions. 1: In my experience moving in together is something you usually do when both parties are on board a long way in to your relationship, this might be cultural or personal but I don't think it is really relevant, what I deem appropriate to do at which parts of my relationship is up to me, I am not telling you, you can not move in together at 2 months either you know. 2: She moved in roughly 3 weeks ago. 3: She bought groceries once, besides that she had not contributed, nor was there an agreement on rent as this was not intended to be permanent unless we decided that later on. 4: She is not homeless, her parents live 40 minutes from me, she has a car and she is welcome there.",

    "body": "I (32F) live with my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.\n\nAfter work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, \"don't talk to me when you're naked\". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.\n\nAngrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.\n\nAnyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??\n\nUPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said \"hi\" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.\n\nThank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.\n\nI'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...\n\nAnd thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.",

    "body": "Hi all, I\u2019ll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.\nI  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( I\u2019m on the pill and he wears a condom). I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.\nI asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn\u2019t want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.\n\nSo whatever, he told me he wasn\u2019t coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. \nHe then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.\nSo I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn\u2019t wanted and I don\u2019t regret it, but it doesn\u2019t mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn\u2019t apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.\n\nAITAH? I feel like he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it\u2019s the \u2018pregnancy hormones\u2019 making me whiny.\n\nETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I\u2019m going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn\u2019t want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.\nAlso don\u2019t waste your time calling me a baby killer, I\u2019m 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. If you can\u2019t understand why, then you\u2019re not someone I want to engage with anyway.",

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is my first time using this platform, I'm sorry for any 'rules' broken or any mistakes made.\n\nA friend of mine showed me this website recently, and since then I have been considering this post.\n\nMy husband and I (married for 3 years, together for 7) had our first child 3 weeks ago. She is perfect, and everything I could ever wish for, even if she is a handful. However, unfortunately, her birth was ... complicated.\n\nI have always been a private person, and very terrified of pregnancy due to the (admittedly low, but to me nonetheless scary) risks associated. My husband knows this, and I specifically asked him, when we found out about this pregnancy, that he tried to help me lower my stress levels, since the pregnancy itself would already be causing me significant stress.\n\nHe succeeded at this during almost all of my pregnancy. He was always very calm, even when he had a bad work day and was upset. He put up with me when I cried over silly things like wanting one specific brand of food that was sold out, he made sure I was comfortable at home and rarely had to go out when I was too big to do so comfortably.\n\nWe agreed on from the start that he would be the only person in the delivery room with me. No parents, no family, no friends, just us and the medical staff.\n\nHowever, on the day I was admitted to the hospital, his mother (who is usually a very, very nice lady, just has her moments) cried to him that it was unfair she would not witness the birth of this grandchild. (My husband has an older sister with two kids, and she was in the delivery room for both of them). My husband tried to get me to agree to having her in the delivery room. I said no, and figured that would be the end of it.\n\nAfter a long, exhausting, painful labor, when my doctor announced my daughter was crowning, I saw the door open and my mother in law come in. No medical staff got up to stop her. My husband was next to me and I clung to his arm and told him to get her out. He tried to argue with me that she should be allowed to see the birth of her grandchild. I started panicking HARD, like I said, I am a private person and did not want my MIL staring into my lady bits while I was so vulnerable and exposed. I kept saying to my husband, \"take her outside, please, get her out of here, please, please\" but he would not budge.\n\nA nurse finally noticed how much I was panicking and stressing and immediately shooed everyone expect me and the staff out of the room. This included my husband.\n\nMy daughter was born soon after, but because of the MIL situation, he did not get to witness the birth. He was very upset at me during the hospital stay, saying I didn't allow him to see his child be born. I feel awfully guilty because I did want my husband in there, but he should not have let his mother in. It's been almost 3 weeks since we have been back home, and he still acts coldly towards me sometimes.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. \n\nSo my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she\u2019s not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I\u2019ve ordered. So many times I\u2019ve ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she\u2019ll say she\u2019s not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. \n\nAnyways in the past year I\u2019ve found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won\u2019t touch any of it.

They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I\u2019m just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal.

It looks really good...\u201d Or she waits until I\u2019m taking a break to ask me multiple times if I\u2019ve finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she\u2019s begging for scraps.

He said \"we learned our blood is blue today!\". \n\nI felt a little bad but said to him \"you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've learned that's actually not true.\". I said I can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. \n\nThe next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right, but he is still skeptical.  \n\nThe next day I compose a nice email, not rude.

I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  \n\nHe emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it.

But I wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.\n\nFinal edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through.

    "body": "I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.\n\nRecently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.\n\nAITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?\n\nI've thought about going to a barber, but I live in a conservative part of the country and I worry about a negative reaction there and every salon I've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well.",

Lots of people try to keep their distance, and it seems he is generally disliked.\n\nManagement doesn't do anything no matter how many times coworkers complain about his behaviour (and they have), presumably because he works very long hours without asking for extra pay because as he admits he has \"nothing better to do\". He is single, no kids, and has said openly he doesn't really have friends, just work colleagues and some family.

This was meant to be a good thing as i could spend the summer holidays with our daughter (5) who had started school for 2 weeks then hit the summer holidays.  I've never had a chance to have time off with her before. Instead my wife announces we are going to China (where she grew up and her parents still live).  She knows I do not enjoy visiting,  especially mid winter.  She talked me in to it by saying we would travel, which I am keen to do, great wall and terracotta warriors specifically mentioned.  Once the trip was booked she says.. \"oh we wont be able to see those things the weather makes travel hard, but we will do day trips out to other cities\".  Even that I could handle, but the day we arrive she days we wont be doing that either.  What happened was just as I feared (and as usual) I'm left to look after daughter in a small apartment in winter, while my wife relaxes in her old room, watching tv, making models and lego (her hobbies), being pampered by her parents and having lunches with her friends.  I had organised to return 5 days early to home, knowing I would want some time too.  It is now a few days until I leave and she has handede a list of chores to do like wash our house, move furniture, stuff she wants done, and will take most of my time. I said no, she will have had a months holiday doing everything she loves, while my few days are filled by tasks she wants...  I also pointed out she had denied me a month of summer holidays with our daughter (yes ive had lots of time in China with her, but stuck in a small apartment vs parks and playgrounds back home is not even close to the same).  I am now getting the cold shoulder and feel so isolated in a strange boring place.  Am I the asshole for wanting a few days to myself after the last couple of months I've had?\n\nUpdate:\nHey all thanks for the comments so far.  Just to clarify, I agreed to the holiday believing we would travel out of town.  This is not usual behaviour from my wife, hence I am so caught out, and am unable to travel myself as I can speak very little Chinese. I also have a new job lined up in the new year.\n\nFurther update:\nHey all thanks for your comments and feedback.  To clarify, we are staying with my in-laws.  We visit China regularly, and they visit us each Chinese New year, and of course have taken the little one out the the malls and local area.  Major learning for me on description in my posts.  Also we live in the southern hemisphere, hence summer holidays atm.\n\nThat said I take on what people say about putting my foot down and could have owned the situation much better.\nHave talked it out and agreed to tackle the chores together when everyone is back. Apparently the planned trips fell through and she just majorly downplayed it, falling back in to her comfort zone.  I'll take a more active role in planning our next trips here.\n\nAnother update:\nThank you again for the feedback, for those who think this is a bogus post, have added a pic link taken out the window this morning (not that it proves too much, but hey). We are in Shanghai, so not isolated but have done this area to death.  Making the most of what I have (I should have made that clearer) but it is limited, was just annoyed to then be asked to give up my own small amount of time after how things ended up here. As I say above, have now talked it through.\n\nOk Google drive was folly, open to an easier way to share in future....removed link, not that fussed if not believed.\n\nLast post here.. again thank you it's been great reading the comments and I'm trying to take them all on.

Basically, it read as follows \"FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!\" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  \n\nNow, let me clarify I am not \"Irate\" or \"fuming\" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.

The house has a large back garden with narrow paths along the sides of the house and this leads to a front garden that's about 1/3 of the size of the back, and is half grass and half paving stones. They have neighbors either side with the same set up.\n\nThe house is number 85. There is no fence between 85 and 83. 83 has 3 kids under 10 y/o. My back garden has a lot of space to run around, and as there is no fence and my cousins are similar ages to 83's kids, my aunt and uncle often let 83's kids come over and play with my cousins, and 83's kids have continued use the garden after my aunt and uncle left.\n\nI have nothing against kids, nor does my wife, but we have plans for the back garden. These include putting up a shed, maybe a few flowers, and we're starting the adoption process soon so we want our kid to have space to play outside.\n\nI went out and measured the property lines a couple weeks ago, and the husband of 83 came out and asked what I was doing. I explained about the fence, said I would pay for it, and put it up myself, told him about my former job doing exactly this, and asked when would be best for me to do it. He said not to do it at all. I asked why, he said they have a baby and I can't be bashing about with hammers and the like. I said I would try to keep it down but I would like to do this. He then asked why I needed to because things were fine as is. I said it's nothing personal, but I'm putting up a shed, and I just don't want his kids coming onto my property and getting hurt. He then said I can't put up the shed for the same reason as the fence, and I could see we weren't getting anywhere and went back inside.\n\nThen Thursday night I'm coming home from work and I see the dad loading bags into their car. Saturday morning and the car is still gone, and has not been seen since Thursday. I figure they've gone away for the weekend and as the issue with me putting up the fence was the noise for the baby now would be the time to do it.\n\nI bought the fence materials that day. I used wooden posts/panels and gravel to hold it in place. Whole thing was done by Sunday lunch. The fence posts are 1.8m and half of that is underground. These things aren't moving until the end of time. It's on my property and less than a meter tall so I didn't need permission from council or 83.\n\nThey got back Monday night and this morning I've woken up to knocking. The husband wants me to get rid of the fence. Says it's an eyesore and he's worried his kids will get injured on it. I tell him it's on my property and it's staying. He says he should have been consulted because it's surrounding his property and his wife hates it and thinks it's really ugly.\n\nLegally I'm in the clear. Morally, am I the arsehole?\n\nInfo: it is a picket fence made of a pale wood. It looks clean and polished on both sides but my side is the one with visible building markers, eg there is a nail in my side of the fence. There is no such issue on his side and I am open to painting it.\n\nEdit: In the nicest, most respectful way possible, I built fences as a routine part of my job nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and have a qualification specifically in putting up various types of fences.

I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. \n\nAnyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his \"boyfriend\" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as \"crushing on each other\" instead. The \"boyfriend\" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying \"Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love.\" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).\n\nMy sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. \n\nI also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.\n\nEdit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people. I am sorry if anyone feels like I am being anything other than genuine.",

    "body": "Every summer my community has a cookoff competition. Usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. It's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. This year it was pasta sauce. I've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and I moved here but this is the first time I entered as a competitor. It was earlier today.\n\nOne of the other competitors, I know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and autism. I don't know much about this condition evidently. I'll call her Jessica. I guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. We've never had this before as far as I know.\n\nTo make the story short, I won the competition. And $1,500. There's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. My wife and I were in shock because I like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? We were tickled pink. \n\nWe celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. You might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to Jessica as a \"gesture of good will\". They said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. We obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. So they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with Jessica. Likewise we said no.\n\nI guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. Apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. After a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.\n\nWe had to leave and haven't collected our winnings yet. We're meant to tomorrow from the mayor's office. I can't even imagine what's going to happen tomorrow.\n\nAre we the assholes for not splitting our winnings with a disabled child for a cooking competition?",

She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. \n\nRecently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.\n\nI shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.\n\nAs you can imagine I'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... Even though my sister has never done anything to help me.\n\nSo yeah, Am I really the asshole here?",

    "body": "Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  \n\nI've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\\~ months.  In this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.\n\nNow, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.\n\n\"I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.\"\n\nNow, of course I understand the sentiment.  I'm not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \\[visibly confused\\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.\n\nI point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  \n\nAt this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.\n\nI say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I've been dating for 8 months.\n\n\"Well maybe you are!\" she says angrily.  At this point, I'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.\n\nNot five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I \"broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn't allowed to grope her whenever I want.\"\n\nSo, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I've missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before you start yelling at me (even though I'm sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, I'll stop, no question.  I just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.  ",

Our parents wealth mainly came from stocks, bonds and their jobs so they didn't have much real estate.\n\nTwo years ago, my brother asked my husband and I for a loan so he could start his own business. I agreed to it and we sign a contract where he uses the real estate our father bought for him as collateral.  At this time, he had been living with his wife in a different city.\n\nHis business was lagging, but he still somehow managed to pay the bills. He was still making the monthly loan repayments to me, so I kept quiet.\n\nRecently, I found out that he sold the property he gave me as collateral to one of our cousins.

    "body": "I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. \n\nOver the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. \n\nIt all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. \n\n\nWe had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. \n\nFinally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. \n\nWhen we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I get to know her and things like that. \n\nI've not said that I'll never be in the same room as her again, I've just said that I won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but John says that I'm overreacting, and that I should give her another chance, which I have no intention of doing.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. While I still stand by my decision and won't take Alicia on holiday unless John is there with me, a lot of people said that I haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. Even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), I think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. It is of course Leanne's decision but it isn't something I'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. As some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why I told John that I will make the effort to get to know Alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as I can.",

It's cheaper to let him live there rent-free than living in the dorms. Obviously the condo is MUCH larger (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. I put several conditions on his living there rent-free. Nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn't), no parties, keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave AND no moving people in. A couple of months ago, I noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because he moved in his girlfriend. His girlfriend was having issues with her roommates. To add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to LA to be an actress and had no where to go. I told my son I didn't give a fuck what problems these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. He lied to me about their moving out. I told him again - no roommates - or leave. He started playing with semantics how they're not really moved in and just spends a night or two. I don't give a fuck. I could be charging 4K a month for the condo (this is Westwood, CA) and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights.

I had some savings & a sum of money that had come through from a medical negligence case, & my partner had some inheritance money. \n\nWe met our neighbours(68M, 65F) the day we started moving furniture in. The woman demanded to know our landlords name so she could \"keep in contact with him\" & seemed genuinely offended when we told her we owned the house. She made a shitty comment about how she had to work all her life to buy her house, & we were \"too young\" to deserve a home\n\nI'm waiting on an organ transplant, so work from home in the meantime. One morning I came home from a quick walk around the block with my dog & noticed their son's car parked across my driveway and blocking mine in. I knocked on the door and politely explained that I need to be able to leave at all times in case of a medical emergency, especially if I'm called in for a transplant. The woman snapped at me that she doesn't like people parking next to her because it makes her drive \"look messy\". Her son did move the car, but called me selfish & a snowflake as he did so. \n\nOnce she hammered on my door and told me to \"shut (my) dog up because he's been barking all day\" even though he was at the vet and had been for a few days. About a month after that, I noticed my dog eating something in my garden. I went over to investigate, & saw he had a chocolate bar in his mouth & had eaten most of it. I found a few more empty wrappers scattered along the fence between my yard & the neighbours', immediately called the vet. I'm pretty sure it was my neighbour, but I don't have solid proof so I can't say anything.\n\nMore than once I've caught her trying to steal our post from the postman. I just don't get *why*.\u00a0 A lot of it is just stuff I need for work (printer paper, sticky notes, etc) with no real monetary value, or medical stuff and non-prescription supplements that are pretty specific to my illness and no use to anyone else. There's literally nothing to be gained from taking it.\n\nHer husband is racist and homophobic, and uses the P-word, N-word,& F-word all the time. He also really hates children. Last Halloween he threw a bucket of water over a group of trick-or-treaters. when the parents came over to complain they pretended they weren't home. \n\nWe've been thinking about extending our kitchen just a little to make it a bit more accessible for me. Somehow in the process, we found our the neighbours' own extention was done illegally. They'd been denied planning permission, but they built it anyway. During the process, they'd also caused some aesthetic damage to our property. A really petty part of me wants to report them, because they've been needlessly nasty for *years*.

I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.\n\nNow, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.\n\nI should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.\n\nAnyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.\n\nMy mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).\n\nHowever, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over \u00a3500. I understand that \u00a32000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.\n\nSo, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop.

The boasting is why i\u2019m typing this out.\n\nShould I tell this insecure motherfucker that his cock is simply not big enough to warrant him using Magnum condoms?

She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them.

She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour.

So, one happy hour, I followed her. Even though I had seen nothing definitive, I confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.\n\nBelieve it or not, I listened to your advice. I received extensive advice from both sides. Publicly, everyone agreed I was at fault. In my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. Regardless, I sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, Brandon. I told her I did not feel as attractive as Brandon and worried that as I was getting older, her interest in me was waning. I also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. I apologized for following her and told her I would never do it again.\n\nShe told me several things. First, that she was offended I did not trust her. Second, that she did suspect Brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. Third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. The thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.\n\nShe also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. She reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.\n\nSo, what of our future? I asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after I had followed her. She joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. She told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (Java, specifically). I haven't told her yet, but I plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the Maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that I never heard of until researching...\n\nTL;DR - My wife and I are back on track.

But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.

I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing \"his\" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",

My girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. The next morning, I wake up very hungover and thirsty. I see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says \"water\" on it. I thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? Very thankful that I didn't have to get up to get water, I proceed to chug the \"water\" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. At that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. \n\nI felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit. She denied putting the \"water\" there so I just thought one of our friends did it. It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. It shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says \"hair of the dog\" then howls.\n\nI confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. I told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. It was a very cruel thing to do. She said I was overreacting and being sensitive.\n\nEdit: I really don't think she lied. I think she probably did it in a blackout.",

They did not have a good relationship and I believe that my mother still suffers mentally from their marriage, divorce, and child custody battle. I know that my father put her down a lot and dragged her through the mud (very publically too.) \n\nIn July, my father passed away very suddenly and very quickly. It was an absolute shock to everyone. Funeral arrangements were quickly made and my mother called my step-mother to ask if it would be okay if she attended the funeral. My step-mother said it was fine, she can even sit up the front in the family section to be with us kids if she'd like to. (Also context, me and my two older siblings are all in 20s.) \n\nNow, at the funeral my mother felt she didn't need to sit with us but sat toward the back of the church. The funeral was fine, we marched him out to the car (he was being cremated, not buried) and then we all went back inside to have refreshments and talk about him, I guess? \n\nSo, during the refreshments, I went into the bathroom and while I was in the stall I could hear two women chatting about why my mother was there. Talking about how she had no right to be there, how would my step-mother feel about it, and that she doesn't belong. I finished up my business, walked out to the sink area where they were standing, and said, \"you need to shut the fuck up about my mother and mind your own fucking business.\" \n\nI left the bathroom in disgust, went to the pub with my siblings, and had a beer to celebrate the life my father lived. \n\nThe funeral happened back in July but I recently ran into one of the women I berated and she told me that she didn't say anything at the funeral because she knew I was upset about my father but that she now feels like she's owed an apology because I \"unreasonably rude\" I told her that I had nothing to apologise for and that if she wanted to gossip about my mother, she should have done it after she left the funeral. She was a bit rude and insisted she said nothing wrong, she was just voicing an opinion. I asked her if she'd like to voice those opinions to my mother and she shut her mouth and walked off. \n\nSo, Reddit, was I being an Asshole?",

Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I \"peaked in high school\" and \"should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs\" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.\n\nMaybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. \n\nI like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.\n\nThanks for everything.",

I already have the heater higher then i want it and everyone else in the house is comfortable. So i give him an extra blanket and go to bed. He stayed up all night playing loud games and kept me awake. I asked him to go to bed multiple times. Then at 6am he comes in my room without knocking and ask for breakfast. I tell him to make cereal because i need sleep. I hear him scream and low and behold he has dropped my good glass mixing bowl on the floor and there's glass and milk everywhere.

    "body": "Throwaway cause reasons.\n\nBackstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F, 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an \"oops\" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. \n\nOn the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.\n\nSo last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. \n\nWhile I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.\n\nWell she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?\n\n(Also, please don't reply with \"YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR\". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)\n\nEdit title: Nephew :/\n\nEdit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?\n\nEdit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really \"take a side\", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, \"Well hun, they are right and you are wrong\". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.\n\nEdit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their \"one shot\" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby.

Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).\n\nA few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like \"Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy\" and \"Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame\".\n\nI eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend. \n\nThings eventually escalated and I left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. \n\nAm I in the wrong? I don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.\n\nEdit for clarity: My girlfriend told me she doesn't want to be around the girl, her intentions on being friends ended the second she started being toxic to her.",

    "body": "My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. \n\nMy boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. \n\nI went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of \"I couldn't help it!\" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. \n\nHe seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a \"stupid fucking cake\" and he ended up storming out. \n\nI realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. \n\nWhen he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not. \n\n  \n\nP.S - To all the people messaging me offering to send me a replacement, your generosity is very much appreciated, but a new cake has been ordered!",

We were talking about the lost cat as we walked because we have a few cats and always joke about how we are crazy cat people (we are in our 30's).\n\nWell sure enough we see this cat just sitting on the roof of a car and it looked just like the one in the reward poster. I walked up to it and it was super nice. I took a pic of it then we walked a block back to the poster to compare. It was the same cat. We went back and got the cat. It was real nice and let me pick it up. It just cuddled up. I think it was pretty scared. My wife called the number on the poster and they gave us their address and walked the cat 4 blocks to the house.\n\nAs we were walking up the sidewalk the kids in the house ran out and screamed in a happy way and grabbed the cat. The parents came out and thanked us for returning their cat. The mom had tears in her eyes. As they were walking back inside I said, \"oh, I noticed there was a $500 reward. Would that apply in this situation? If not, I totally understand.\" The dad just looked at me with daggers and the wife looked real confused. She said in a kinda condescending way, \"you really want us to give you $500?\" I said, \"I'm not trying to be awkward or anything, but you did offer a reward and we did find your cat.\" The dad said, \"Jesus, hold on\" and went inside and got $320. He comes back outside and said, \"All I have is $320 cash on hand. I can get you the rest if it's really that big of a deal to you.\" I said, \"no, that's fine and he handed me the $320.\" As they walked back inside the wife said under her breath, \"I can't believe he took the money\" and the husband said, \"yeah, what a dick.\" They clearly said it loud enough for me to hear.\n\nMy wife is totally on my side. We live in a pretty affluent area so $500 (or $320) isn't a big deal to these people. I mean they had two Mercedes in their driveway nor is that money a big deal for me.

The other half said I should have just \"done the right thing\" and not asked for it.\n\nEdit: My wife's and my parents think I should have just given the cat back with no reward.

We decided that we would watch the first 2 quarters, get up at halftime for the bathroom and food, and then make it back before the 3rd quarter started. \n\nWhen we got back from the bathroom, there was a couple in our seats (no big deal). But they were eating those stadium peanuts that make a MESS, and guess what? I am deathly allergic to peanuts. \n\nMe: \u201cExcuse me you\u2019re in our seats, can you guys please get up?\n\nGuy: \u201cOh yeah my bad\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I see how much of a mess is EVERYWHERE. Our seats are literally the only 2 in the row. A row of JUST 2 seats. And this guy and his wife just have 2 bags worth of peanut debris and dust all over our chairs. We were gone for maybe 15 minutes. \n\nMe: \u201cDude really? I\u2019m allergic to peanuts and you have absolutely trashed our seats\u201d\n\nGuy: \u201cHow am I supposed to know that?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re not!

The guards were very apologetic and thankfully got a janitor surprisingly fast to clean it all up. My friend says I was an asshole though. I thought I handled it well? I don\u2019t carry an epipen on me either, I was paranoid the rest of the night about a nut exposure. \n\nSo lay it on me, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: people seem to not understand peanut allergies, so here\u2019s an ELI5: if you ingest a peanut, your body goes into immune overdrive, essentially killing you while thinking it\u2019s defending. If it touches your skin (depending on your severity) you will break out into hives which in my opinion from the time I did eat nuts, was the worst part of it all. No I won\u2019t die, but I was scratching myself until I was bleeding once. EATING and TOUCHING nuts with an allergy is different.\n\nEdit2: I\u2019m buying an epipen, please stop pretending to be concerned now\n\nEdit3: I\u2019ve been temporarily banned, or else I would keep responding to asinine comments",

I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. \n\nObviously that didn\u2019t work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I\u2019m a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she\u2019d changed her mind, and she kept the baby.\n\nI wasn\u2019t thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.\n\nAfter a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I\u2019m so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I\u2019m able to give my son experiences that I never had. \n\nHe chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he\u2019d always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he\u2019d get yelled at because he\u2019s the oldest, etc. \n\nHis mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. \n\nIt was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he\u2019ll be needing soon anyway and which I\u2019ve had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I\u2019m a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I\u2019ve \u2018never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it\u2019s obvious his dad is spending money on him\u2019 ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn\u2019t feel bad? \n\nShe said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that\u2019s an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. \n\nShe\u2019s normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it\u2019s acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I\u2019ve never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.",

We\u2019re a group of girls and guys with similar interests (fitness/sports) and they\u2019re all so friendly. They showed me around the city and made me feel really comfortable. \n\nOne of my friends is this guy (Mark). Everyone\u2019s fit but Mark is the odd one out because he\u2019s quite overweight. He doesn\u2019t go to the gym either but when we\u2019re all hanging out (bar, dinners, fun activities etc) he always comes along. \n\nMark is a really happy/bubbly guy and obviously the most beloved in the group. I could tell that everyone is very fond of him which I totally understand. He\u2019s really kind and just a sweet person. Sometimes I tease him about his weight but it\u2019s all in good nature and he doesn\u2019t mind. Normally I get told to leave him alone but as long as he\u2019s fine I don\u2019t think I\u2019m hurting anybody. \n\n\nSo yesterday we were all hanging out together and one of the girls started showing me old group photos of their trips over the years. Mark looked REALLY different, I almost didn\u2019t recognize him. He was very fit, muscular and super handsome. (He has a nice face anyway but without the excess fat you could actually see his amazing bone structure). I was shocked and pointed out that he used to look really good and asked him what happened. It wasn\u2019t a mean spirited question at all, I just wanted to know what went wrong. \n\nSuddenly the room went quiet and EVERYBODY was shooting daggers at me. Then one girl said \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up\u201d and literally told me to leave. I was pretty confused and explained that I just wanted to know how/why he got so fat. Mark looked awkward and didn\u2019t really answer my question. Everyone started berating me and standing up for him as if I\u2019m some villain. Mark actually defended me and told them that it\u2019s fine but they insisted that it\u2019s not fine. \n\nAfterwards someone spoke to me in private and said that I should think before I speak and that I have no tact. Now everybody\u2019s being weird with me and I don\u2019t get why. They clearly think I\u2019m an asshole but Mark doesn\u2019t (otherwise why would he defend me?). Am I the asshole here? \n \n\n\n**TL;DR I asked my overweight friend who used to be in shape why he gained so much weight over the years. Everybody thinks I\u2019m TA**\n\n**EDIT: I have been informed that Mark experienced a severely traumatic incident a few years ago. I had no idea this was the case and obviously feel bad. I will apologize but completely understand if he doesn\u2019t accept my apology.**\n\n\u2014FAQ\u2014\n\n_Are you autistic?_ - No\n\n_Are you a sociopath/psychopath?_ - Nope\n\n_Do you suffer from any personality disorders such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder?_ - Not that I know of. Probably not \n\n_Why are you so superficial?_ - I\u2019m not. I have friends from ALL sorts of backgrounds. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re fat or not. \n\n_Were you raised by wolves/in the jungle etc?_ - Nope\n \n_Do you even feel bad about hurting his feelings?_ - Yeah i do.

So she told my mom that she was gonna wait a few weeks then tell him she \u201cmiscarried.\u201d I was really upset and told her this is messed up of her to lie like this, but both she and my mom agreed this was the only way to \u201ckeep\u201d this guy around. \n\nWell it had been more than a few weeks but she hasn\u2019t said anything to him.

    "body": "\nMy parents split up when I was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. My mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and I and stopped paying child support. He justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way I had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. About a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. However, today he asked if my sister and I could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which I had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. I rejected his request and told him I wasn\u2019t ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and I suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. After rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said I was murdering him. Some of my friends also said I should forgive him because he is my father and that I am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. So AITA?\n\nEdit: His other kids are still pretty young (~15 and I\u2019m not sure how many other kids he has but I think at least one other) so I\u2019m not sure they are able to donate at their age. Also an update: my aunt (my dad\u2019s sister) who I also haven\u2019t spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. At this point I\u2019m leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for all your replies and advice. I\u2019ve decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister. I realize now that I shouldn\u2019t feel any guilt for not donating as this man is not truly my dad.",

My family, on the other hand, is extremely casual. We love to joke around and poke fun. I think if Kate\u2019s family were to describe my family, there would be comments about propriety and lack thereof.\n\nThe day after the wedding, Kate\u2019s parents hosted brunch at their house. When I arrived, I walked into the living room. Sitting there was Kate\u2019s dad, her grandma, and my other brother. On the coffee table, there was a large serving platter. On the serving platter, there was a dip that had been prepared in a mold. You don\u2019t see a lot of dip molds these days, so [here\u2019s a visual](https://www.createdby-diane.com/2010/07/how-to-make-dip-more-appetizing.html) to give you an idea of what I\u2019m talking about. This dip was a little different. It was about a foot long, in the unmistakable shape of a penis and testicles.\n\nWhen I saw it, I thought I had misjudged my brother\u2019s new in-laws. Food in the shape of dick and balls? What could be funnier than that? They had clearly been hiding their great sense of humour all this time. As soon as I saw the dip I burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cSomething left over from the bachelorette party?\u201d I said.\n\nMy brother\u2019s father-in-law looked me dead in the eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lobster,\u201d he said.\n\nAs other guests arrived, it became clear who was in my family and who was in Kate\u2019s family. My family were all making thinly veiled penis jokes, while Kate and her family ignored us and pretended there wasn\u2019t a giant dick on the table.\n\n\u201cSo creamy,\u201d my cousin said as she dug into the shaft with a cracker.\n\n\u201cThey should have put some sprouts around the base,\u201d my aunt said.\n\nFor months, I\u2019ve been telling people the dick dip story, and anyone with a sense of humour thinks it\u2019s hilarious. Last weekend, I had some people over to my house, and as a joke, I decided to make my own dick dip. Out of respect for my sister-in-law, who lives in a different city, I did not post any photos of the dick dip to social media. Some of my friends, however, couldn\u2019t help themselves. Kate saw photos of the dick dip on a mutual friend\u2019s Instagram story, and now she is upset.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard from her, but my brother called me and said I\u2019m disrespecting her and her family. He says I need to apologize. In my opinion, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and Kate should lighten up. It\u2019s a dip in the shape of a penis. Relax.\n\nAITA for making a dick dip?",

My friend and her ex are at odds due to my friend's living situation. She can no longer afford to live in her apartment and moved into a shelter briefly which becomes a unanimous \"no\" in terms of custody battles. If you don't have a permanent residence that's like a house or apartment, you will almost always lose these cases. I outstretched an olive branch and let her live with me. She's been here two weeks. I have a house so it's no big deal for me.\n\nSomething about me: two years ago I lost my husband and daughter in an MVA. I have dozens of photos of us all as a family, and about a dozen of my daughter. My late husband was a photographer and was the one who took all of our shots, not a cellphone photo in sight. In fact, I have precisely zero photos otherwise of us.\n\nTwo days ago was the first day my friend was allowed access to her child for the day and I was at work all day. I figured they'd hang out at home while I worked. It turns out her son got at my albums and destroyed or defaced pretty much all of them. I have no clean photos of my daughter anymore, they're either ripped to shreds or have marker all over them.\n\nMy friend did nothing to stop this: this doesn't happen in the time it takes to run to the washroom or anything so I deduce it was either my friend went out for an extended period of time leaving her son home alone or she just didn't care. In either case, I was furious.\n\nI decided to give me friend three days notice to leave. She has no tenant rights as she's been here <30 days, in fact I had to give her no time but I didn't want to toss her to the streets with nothing. She leaves tomorrow.\n\nWas I an asshole here? Her son destroyed property of mine of extreme sentimental value. I don't know if I can get them restored and getting new prints is impossible. In the back of my mind I think of her custody battle and how I've thrown a wrench in it all but this is beyond a tiny thing. This was malicious negligence on her part.",

The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.\n\nWhen she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.\n\nYet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.\n\n- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.\n- Got muck/handprints everywhere\n- Broke and refused to replace things in my house\n- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day\n- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired\n- Left mountains of clothes everywhere\n- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)\n- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours\n- Literally drained me emotionally and financially\n- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.\n- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls\n- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc\n- Kept leaving the toilet a mess\n- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc\n\nWhen I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.\n\nAbout a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.\n\nWe are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me \u00a3165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of \u00a3600 per month for her rent alone.\n\nI feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.\n\nAITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?\n\n\nEdit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.\n\nUPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!\n\nAfter getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.\nLike some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.\n\nA while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:\n\n \"Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX\"\n\nSome of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.\n\nUPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.\n\nA)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.\n\nB)  She never gave BJs\n\nC)  She INSISTED on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me \"Go down on me, or there is no sex\"\n\nD)  Never did anything else.  Vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",

She wanted a lifestyle change. Enter her new husband, an unemployed \u2018actor\u2019 with two children. He is irresponsible, shady, not trustworthy. I have caught him rummaging in my grandsons room in my home with no excuse as to why. There are other things too that make me distrust him. \n\nI have a lot of anger surrounding my daughters choice which in my opinion was motivated by selfishness- she took off and left my grandson with me and my wife while she went out of state for weeks on end throughout the past year to visit her partner, and my grandsons grades, happiness, and health have all taken an enormous knock. He has lost weight, misses his mother and father, is lonely and anxious.

I connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. I still really don\u2019t know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. However, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. I talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. I did some research, and was able to corroborate with DNA testing that he is indeed my mother\u2019s first cousin. Obviously that was shocking, and I feel like my existence was a mistake. I\u2019ve been struggling with it. Thankfully, from what I\u2019ve read, there\u2019s very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and I don\u2019t have any medical issues. I do wear contacts, have ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Auditory Processing Disorder, and I\u2019m prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). But none of these are major in the slightest and I live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. I\u2019m in a relationship right now, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll last or if it\u2019ll last. I would love to eventually marry him but I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019m  being a realist here.

My life is a meme at this point\n\nEdit: I honestly did not think this would blow up so much. Really glad this is a throwaway. I guess some info for people.\n\n1. My mother didn\u2019t know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother\u2019s side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn\u2019t a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn\u2019t look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 \nbecause it was right after high school. \n\n2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn\u2019t long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he\u2019s not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. \n\n3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It\u2019s not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.\n\n**Edit 2** This blew up like crazy and I was certainly not expecting it! I really appreciate all the kind words and reassurance!

Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

I handmade umbrellas out of paper and toothpicks for drinks and drew a cartoon character he likes by hand on each one. I blew up those big gold number balloons with a straw. I batch made blue Hawaiians since he had wanted a tiki birthday. I got all the materials for a cupcake and full sized cake challenge that I carefully planned. I spent 2 days baking.\n\nWhen it came time to play and I surprised him with the game (which would take 45min-1h), he sat there motionless and said he didn\u2019t want to play and that his birthday always sucks and no one does anything for him and that he shouldn\u2019t have to work on his birthday. He just wants to eat cake and this is a stupid idea. He likes to *watch* the show, he doesn\u2019t want to actually try it. No one cares about him. He\u2019s all alone on his birthday and didn\u2019t get to see anyone, etc.\n\nI cry about how I tried really hard and I\u2019m sorry he thinks my idea is stupid but I thought he\u2019d love it.

About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience.

For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared.

    "body": "TLDR at the bottom;\n\nHello, all! Well, if it isn't obvious already from the title, I am dying. I don't feel the details are super relevant to the issue at hand, but for those who are curious about my ultimate demise, I have cystic fibrosis and after two rejected lung transplants, I've been told there isn't anything else they can do except keep me comfortable in my last few weeks. I've begun my preparations for my funeral and such and while I was thinking it would be a breath of fresh air in this whirlwind of death, I could not have been more wrong.\n\nNow, on to the title! My parents are both STRICT Southern Baptists and want a very traditional funeral. This includes; hymns to be sung during the memorial, a casket and graveside service, a viewing, countless prayers during the memorial, scripture to be read, etc. My issue with this is...well, everything. I am the complete opposite of my parents; not religious, curse like a sailor, drink like the Irish, you name it. Everything they are wanting and attempting to plan is not me as a person. I've somehow made it to 25 and managed to meet the man of dreams and marry him last year and he is torn. He wants me to have it exactly as I want, he just doesn't want to have to deal with my parents after the fact while actively grieving. I have two siblings, one of which is a clone of my parents and one that is a mixture of my parents and myself. \n\nI want my service to be one full of laughter, funny stories and pictures, upbeat music, cats (my husband and I are avid cat lovers), I want confetti and shit! But, more importantly, I want to be cremated and put in a fucking cat-shaped urn. I told my husband I wanted my ashes to be handed out like party favors (so my family and friends can take me with them because I love to travel) and he looked horrified. \n\nMy parents are absolutely NOT on board and are essentially planning everything how they want. Attempting to take me \"shopping\" for a casket, flowers, picking out hymns and verses, the whole deal. I'm obviously not very pleased. \n\nSo, I guess my question would be, WIBTA if I took control of my own funeral and wrote a will to be followed exactly how I want it? I understand my parents are grieving and I've tried to compromise with a mixture of both my views and theirs, but, they aren't having it. I never thought dying would be so fucking stressful and I just want to enjoy what time I have left, without leaving a bomb of emotion and disappointment behind. Please, help.\n\nTLDR: I am dying and my parents want to plan a funeral that \"isn't me\" as a person.\n\nEDIT: I should clarify the \"ashes as party favors\" thing. I wanted my closest friends and family to go home with a vial or something of the sort of my ashes that way they could do with them as they please! Not everyone will get a piece of me, as strange as that sounds!\n\n2nd EDIT: HOLY SHIT. I was not expecting this! THANK YOU. Seriously. I have read every comment and I wish I could reply to every single one, that is the goal! So, please, be patient with me. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and messages, it's been so overwhelming and if I were a cat, I would be making biscuits and purring until I keeled over. I am writing down everything that I want and will be approaching my parents in order to find a compromise. Yes, funerals are for the living and being able to remember that person for who they WERE. I am not all of the things my parents wanted me to be and I want them to understand this as they deal with my passing. I am willing to compromise, so, wish me luck! I will attempt to keep up with everything and as lame as this sounds, I'm off living my best life and trying to do something different everyday, so, I won't always have my phone. Tomorrow we are travelling to the fucking Everglades so I can watch my husband be terrified while on an airboat. It's going to be awesome.",

    "body": "About a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and I said yes. So the next day his friend shows up while I\u2019m at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I\u2019ve never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I\u2019m sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of \u201cdude, put on a bra\u201d. I figure he\u2019s joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn\u2019t bring it up again for the rest of that visit. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I\u2019m home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn\u2019t as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone \u201cI thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!\u201d  I\u2019m taken aback and I don\u2019t really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a \u201cwhat,why?\u201d \n\nHim: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs \nMe: But you can\u2019t actually see my boobs \nHim: Are you kidding me? They\u2019re huge! Of course I can see them! \nMe: Dude, I\u2019m wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don\u2019t understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. \nHim: you\u2019re joking right??\nMe: No...? \nHim: fucking unbelievable\n\nI look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I\u2019m ok. I tell him I\u2019m fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we\u2019re out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn\u2019t want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend\u2019s stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. \n\nSo finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should\u2019ve just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should\u2019ve been more accommodating to a guest that\u2019s very important to my bf. \nSo, am I the asshole here?",

    "body": "I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. \n\n\nAbout 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. \n\n\nWhen I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. \n\n\nI griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. \n\nAt this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

The company I work for is doing a merge, and I have been putting in longer hours to try and get things done so that when my wife has our baby, I won't constantly be pulled away or called while trying to support her and our son.\n\nMy little brother works a trade that usually has next to no work during the winter (he does roofing and siding for his friends dad, and we live in Canada) so lately, he's just been sitting at home playing on his computer or going out with friends.\n\nIt's been snowing here pretty heavy the last 3 days, and now that its finally lightened up, we can  do the sidewalks. I called my wife on my break and she mentioned that some of the kids that come by have a hard time getting through the snow (we live by a school and on a corner lot, so we are responsible for shoveling the side as well) \nI told her to get my brother to shovel the walks, she said she asked him, but he told her he was  going out, (this was at about noon).\n\n I texted my brother and asked what time he would be home, he said around 2, so I asked him to shovel the walks when he got back, he asked when the last time I shoveled them. I got annoyed and told him again to please shovel the walks as I wouldn't be home till around 8, he didn't respond.\n\nI got home and saw they were done, when I went inside, my wife was laying down and holding her stomach (just some Braxton Hicks she said) I asked her if she was okay, and she said yes, just exhausted from shoveling. I was furious. I asked her why my brother didn't do it, and she said he refused as he is not the home owner. \n\nI went into our basement and lost my shit at him, reminding him that he lived rent free in my house and ate my food. He told me I was over reacting, that it was just snow, and that him living there didn't mean he was obligated to do \"my chores\". I  told him to get out. He left and about a hour later I got a call from my mom yelling at me to call my brother and apologies, that he has no where else to go, and how I shouldn't be acting like this a few weeks before Christmas. I told her he needed to apologize to my wife and I, and that if he wanted to come back, he needs to be contributing going forward. \n\nHe ended up staying at a friend's last night, and I have yet to hear from him, AITA here?\n\nEdit: just wanted to add, my brother's response to  my wife shoveling was that she made that choice to do that, as he told her to wait for me. I've also had a coworker tell me it was a huge over reaction on my end, and that while my brother should apologize, I should as well.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the responses, just to answer a few questions though: \n\nMy wife told me it wasn't that big of a deal that she ended up doing it (she still shouldn't of had to though) and in our city, we usually have about 24 hours to clear the snow until a bylaw officer comes around, so I'm surprised they weren't around sooner (I'm assuming it was due to the amount of snow we were getting for 3 days straight) so that, plus my wife watching kids struggle, plus us being liable for any injury was her reasoning for doing it.\n\nSo yes I was mad that my very pregnant wife ended up doing it, but also his complete lack of respect to her and myself, asking me when I had done it last, saying it was a home owners job......\n\nAnd as for my mom, her and my dad live in one of those 55+ retirement communities out in a county about 90 Min away, I guess he could stay with them for a bit, but I think it has to be okayed with the condo committee (I'm not sure how that works) \n\nI have also yet to hear back from my brother in regards to my stipulations about him coming back.\n\nEdit: sorry, one more thing since I see it coming up alot. In my Province and I believe most of Canada, the Residential Tenancies Act doesn't apply to family members living with landlords, he is in no way legally considered a tenant in my home, so unless his name is on the deed to my house,  we can have him come and go as we so choose.

    "body": "Some context:\n\nI\u2019m extremely pregnant (like waddling Danny-DeVito-as-The-Penguin pregnant) and fighting a chest cold, back pain, bruised rib, overall fatigue, and a womb resident that won\u2019t quit moving (which is a good thing, but can be painful!). I work from home, which makes it easier. \n\nMy boyfriend has an abscess that requires a root canal. YIKES. I\u2019ve never had a root canal, but tooth/mouth pain is no joke. He works in a field where he\u2019s on his feet for sometimes 12+ hours a day. \n\nThe setup:\n\nYesterday, he came home early after the dentist. Knowing that he\u2019s been tired and feeling bad, last night I got him set up in bed, made him dinner (twice), picked up his antibiotics, brought him ice cream and tea, and overall just made sure he had everything he needed. I even slept in the other room, as I tend to get up a lot because pregnancy is uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t want to bug him. Truly, I\u2019m happy to do it. \n\nThis morning, I woke up to a text from him that just said, \u201cI need water.\u201d\n\n*I need water.*\n\nI was annoyed, because even though he\u2019s not feeling well, a tooth abscess doesn\u2019t take away your ability to walk. I brought it to him anyway, and he made a big deal about lifting himself up to drink from the cup and take two ibuprofen. No \u201cthank you.\u201d Just put his head back down and closed his eyes. \n\nPain is pain\u2014I get it. I don\u2019t have a monopoly on discomfort just because pregnancy can sometimes really blow. It\u2019s not a competition. But it is kind of cringe-y to demand your pregnant girlfriend, who already has some mobility issues and near-constant pain, to grab you something you could easily get yourself. \n\nThe AITA dilemma:\n\nTrying to be lighthearted about the audacity of that text request, I drew a picture on his breakfast cup (something I do every day when I make his breakfast) of a tombstone with the words \u201cI need water\u201d on it, surrounded by flowers and with his birth year - 2019 on it. \n\nHe was...not happy. Like, actually mad that I did that. He said my humor \u201cis not normal,\u201d and that it\u2019s not at all funny. He left in a huff and without saying goodbye. \n\nSo, AITA for the joke? Or am I missing the real issue entirely?\n\n*ETA: We both apologized for not being considerate of the other person, and it\u2019s all ok. He\u2019s a good dude, just off his game today. Still doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m as funny as I think I am, though\u2014lol.*",

There was only one secretary, and I knew instantly who it was- My mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.\n\nI ran in but there was a line up, I told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if I was blind \"there's a line hun\".\n\nI waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.\n\nI got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was \"Ready to talk to me\" I was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. I was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation I was in.\n\nI dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. The secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.\n\nShe started by telling me \"See hun, I told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, A student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, I could have handled this situation a lot better- I have a lot of students to deal with\"\n\nI looked at her and said \"what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? Every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? Were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?\"\n\nI yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave \"The school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude\"\n\nAre you serious? How am I supposed to react in that situation? Yes, I agree I was really angry, but I feel like I was justified- My sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- I would have waited if I heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. AITA?\n\nEDIT- \n\nTo add context, some people are confused as to why I didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because\n\n1.) I don't know what hospital to go to\n\n2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact\n\n3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a \"prank\" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, I guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",

She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.\n\nSo the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said \"Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model\" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.\n\nI dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?\n\n\\*\\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.\n\n\\*\\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.\n\nI genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.\n\nI shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Final Edit\n\nAt this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.\n\nI was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to \"show her off\" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as \"the bad guy\" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off its not as glamours as I thought it was\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a \"Model\" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a \"model\" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",

    "body": "I (21F) love makeup, and buy makeup that lasts longer and is of higher quality, but also thus more expensive. It's worth it to me, however, and I save money from my paycheques every month to go towards these purchases. I probably spend $80-100 a month on makeup.\n\nWhen I got home from last night, my brother (28M) had his girlfriend over and they were watching a movie. I said hello and went on to do my own thing the rest of the night.\n\nThe next morning, when I went to put my makeup on, I couldn't find either of my mascaras, my eyeshadow palette or my red lipstick. I didn't start to panic yet, as I thought it could've been me or my mom who just moved something temporarily. My brother got up from bed during my search, however, and when he asked what I was looking for, I told him. He said 'Oh I lent that stuff to Kara. We're going out to a fancy dinner tonight and she doesn't have a lot of nice makeup.\"\n\nI WAS PISSED. I asked him what gave him the right to lend MY makeup to his girlfriend without my permission. He told me to chill out because he'd get it back from her tonight anyways. I told him that wasn't the point - it was MY stuff and he should've asked before just giving it to his girlfriend. I told him I didn't want her using my makeup because that's totally unsanitary. He got angry because I've let \"Olivia borrow my mascara before\" - Olivia is our sister, so to me sharing makeup with your sister (who reciprocates the favour) is a TOTALLY different story, and I wouldn't let her borrow my lipstick.\n\nHe isn't talking to me yet and is refusing to get my makeup back from his girlfriend until after their dinner tonight. I don't want to use makeup after his girlfriend I don't know does. I told him he owes me at the very least a new mascara and lipstick. He says I'm being annoying and mean. AITA?",

    "body": "A close friend of mine has bipolar disorder, and he is religiously committed to his treatment - he takes his meds on time, never misses out on any of his therapy sessions. He also has an incredibly supportive family and a wonderful, accepting girlfriend. I think he's thriving in his personal life and his diagnosis is being taken care of very well.\n\nAnyway, he lost his job a while ago and has been applying ever since. He approached me with his resume so I could help him out because he was not scoring any interviews. At first I thought he was being hyperbolic but he actually applied to more than 95 places over a span of 2 weeks and got no calls. He has plenty of experience, excellent reviews and is more than qualified. So it was quite puzzling to me that he couldn't get any calls out of this massive exercise, but when I went through his resume I found out that he had mentioned in it that he has bipolar disorder and depression and that he is in treatment for it. That would explain his failiure rates, because of the stigma attached to mental health.\n\nSo I told him that he should consider removing it from his Resume. First of all, his mental health is his business alone. Second, he is being responsible enough by treating the condition for what it is - a health related condition. He wouldn't be writing that he has Asthma in his resume, for instance. He didn't have any objections, just that his Girlfriend told him that he should embrace his disorder and not shy away from it.\n\nLater that night his gf texted me and politely told me that it wasn't right that I told him to remove it. It's a part of him and he shouldn't be hiding such things from potential employers. If they reject him for his diagnosis, they weren't fit to work at anyway. I put across my perspective and she just asked me to stay out of it.\n\nSo, honestly I'm not sure if what I said was correct. AITA?",

    "body": "I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. \n\nThe ring is cheap. It was \u00a3300 and has actually gone down to \u00a3180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.\n\nI could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for \u00a3250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. It's the proposal in terms of when and how I do it that would be a surprise.\n\nEdit 2: I really want to thank everyone for contributing and helping me out. I left to run some errands and returned to an overwhelming response full of additional advice which goes above and beyond, I really appreciate it. I am not going to be able to reply to everyone, but I am reading and upvoting.\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for the gold. I haven't found the comment it's on yet.

We get along fine usually.\n\n\nMy husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.\n\n\nRecently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.\n\n\nToday my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. I'm kind of shocked that I'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. I feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: For all those asking if I resent my in laws for not helping... I think any parent would like help.

However I am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",

They finally agreed, on the condition that I'd be responsible for it and take care of it. That's how I got Mickey, the cutest Cocker Spaniel and best boy ever.\n\nI did take care of him. I took him for a walk every day. Started spending my own money to buy him food. I was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, I even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. They made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so I tried to stick to dog food.\n\nBut my mom (53F) would still give him \"treats\" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. Throughout the years I confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. I tried to buy her \"good\" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.\n\nOver the years, Mickey started gaining weight. He refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. He also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. I was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. She'd even make snide remarks about how he'd \"chosen her as his mommy\" and \"liked her better\". This only increased my resentment towards my mom.\n\nFast forward a few years, I had to move away for college. I reluctantly agreed to leave Mickey with my parents. His health started to decline even more. My mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. Every time I visited I'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.\n\nThis has been going on for four years. Mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. Last week, he started vomiting blood. My parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.\n\nThat surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. My mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. I told her I can't do it. I do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which I need for myself. I love Mickey, but I can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.\n\nUpon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and \"basically killing the dog\". She said I'm the reason she bought Mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. I told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.\n\nLater my dad called, told me I'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die \"just to punish her\". The dog's life is more valuable than an \"I told you so\" to my mom. He asked me to reconsider. I still said no, but now I feel really conflicted. So Reddit, AITA?",

    "body": "Hi all. For reference, I am 29f and my husband is 30m. We\u2019ve been together since I was 20, and got married when I was 26. When we moved in together when I was 25, we were splitting our rent evenly. I was making 65k and he was making 80k, and we live in a large US city. It didn\u2019t really make a huge difference in my budget vs his to split rent 50/50 for 2600 a month rent.\n\nHowever, things have changed. I got pregnant a few months after we go married (which we were so happy about and wanted). I didn\u2019t want to not work, but I wanted to be home with our baby, so I found a full time remote job in my field of work. The downside is I took a cut to my salary from 65k to 50k. We continued to split rent in our apartment.\n\nMy husband, between being 26 and 30, has received a number of raises and has switched his job. He is now a senior business analyst, making roughly 195k a year. Since we were having a child, we were going to need a bigger apartment. We found a 3 bedroom for 4000k per month. He still wanted to split rent evenly, despite my protests, and despite me wanted to try to find a smaller apartment for less. In the end, I sort of let myself get walked over because he really is such a smooth talker and I do love him.\n\nAnyway, flash forward 2.5 years, our rent has increased to 4400k. My take home pay monthly after taxes is roughly 3600k. I am paying 2.2k monthly in rent. I am also taking care of our baby and our home, doing chores, and cooking daily. My husband works from 8 - 6, but typically doesn\u2019t get home until 7. I am burnt out. I barely have enough money per month to do things I enjoy. I feel like I am financially struggling while my husband is living a life of luxury. Yes he does take me out on dates and on vacation, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that this is not enough for me.\n\nI spoke to him two days ago very seriously, and when I asked about trying to split rent based on our income and pay an equal percentage of our income so that it is more fair than fully equal. His reaction stunned me. He asked me why having 1.6k extra a month wasn\u2019t enough for me. I told him I\u2019m not saving anything. He told me I should spend less on extracurricular activities - which makes me laugh because what extracurricular activities? All I do is work, cook, clean, shop for the house and raise our child. I told him I am basically working two full time jobs at once and I need help. Then he asked me if I am suggesting he pay me for being a mother and that stunned me - I really had no response to that.\n\nAnyway, he told me that this is the lifestyle we agreed when we moved in together way back when. However, he doesn\u2019t seem to understand, or rather does not want to understand.\n\nNow he is mad with me because he thinks I am being selfish and has been acting cold to me these past few days. I am getting the itch to apologize and take it back like I always do, but I really feel I am right here.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for all of the responses. I can honestly say I did not expect to get this feedback. \n\nI am honestly overwhelmed and cannot reply to all of you, especially while I am working but I wanted to update some things here.\n\nI love my husband with all my heart, and it is heartbreaking for me to read these comments and realize that I am being taken advantage of. I need to figure out the best way to approach this issue and solve it before it gets too far. I want to work this out and the fear of being alone is haunting me.\n\nYes I did sign a prenup that was overseen by his family attorney. My husband comes from extreme wealth and I was young and stupid and went with it. Head over heels like my mother always said I was.\n\nAs for his family - we get along great and they love me. It\u2019s very confusing because they are such incredibly generous people, and they are family. But they don\u2019t know about our financial situation because my husband and I believe that our marriage is private. And I would feel like I was betraying him by telling them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I cannot reply to all of you, but please know I am reading all of the comments and making of plan of approach with them.\n\nEDIT 2: for those talking about the dates and vacations bit that he pays for - I have asked him numerous times to help lighten my financial load instead of going on these trips and dates and he has refused. He said he can do what he wants with his money and if he wants to take us on vacation that is what he will pay for. If I could afford vacation I would pay. In fact, when we were in a more even financial situation, unmarried, not kids - I paid for almost ALL of our vacations and dates because I love to treat people. And I can\u2019t do that anymore.\n\nEDIT 3: I also DO NOT have bad spending habits. I worked my way out of my student loan debt in two years after graduating. I saved 60k but the time we got married, and I have that all in my retirement which I am thankful for because I can no longer contribute to it. This has NOTHING to do with how I spend. I am actually pretty frugal when it comes to shopping, especially since I prefer to keep things cheap for my budget.",

    "body": "Settle in, this'll be a long one...\n\nNew 1st time dad here to a healthy little princess born this past Thursday. Unfortunately, the joy my wife & I felt in this scenario was temporarily halted by my mother's wholly inappropriate behavior that I'm just not ok with.\n\nSome background: my mom has always been one of those people with a massive victim complex. People she knows go out to dinner & don't invite her? Must have been intentional. A decision is made without getting her input? Must have been done on purpose to spite her. You get the idea. \n\nThis behavior manifested heavily 5 years ago when we got married and became a sore point for a long time. Once she found out we were expecting, again the negative behaviors came out. \n\nTired of her leaving a stain on every moment that should be joyous, I finally had a sitdown with her. I told her in no uncertain terms that I wasn't going to raise my daughter in a negative environment like this, that we want her to be around and involved but her attitude needs to change. I was polite but firm about all of this. She resisted at first, resorting to her usual ways & thinking I was just plotting to get away from her completely, but in the end she claimed to have understood where I was coming from and promised to try and change her tone.\n\nWell, the big day arrives and everyone is at the hospital. Baby is born, we had some bonding time as a family, then invited the grandparents (both sides) up to meet her. On arrival we introduced her and shared her name (we'd elected to keep it a secret). My wife and I come from different religious backgrounds and thus different naming traditions. Mine is to name after a departed loved one, hers is to name after a living relative. So our compromise was to name her after my grandmother (mom's mom) who passed a while ago and make the middle name for her mom, our daughter's grand mother.\n\nAfter being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name. So I explain and at first she's beaming that her granddaughter is named for her mother, then when we get to the middle name her face changes to a look of pure anger and she says YOU DID WHAT?!? I calmly explain again, only to get OK, folded arms and a pouting demeanor clearly displaying her disapproval at this choice. This is supposed to be a happy occasion and I finally decided enough was enough and told her it was time to go. This lead to resistance from my dad, her going off the rails again about how everything is against her, and my wife hysterical that another even has been messed up. So I told my dad flat out that this behavior is the reason why and I won't have my kid around it, that when she's ready to behave like the grandmother we want our daughter around she can return but for today we're through. Apparently according to any and all in my family I'm the asshole for stepping in this way.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong here, but I leave that decision up to you guys. TIA",

    "body": "Alt account. Ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. \n\nBasically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as \"mama\" and often talks about \"the kids\", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said \"maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context\". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. \n\nTurns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?\n\nETA: I bought her her favourite coffee and apologised this morning. She's still being a bit standoffish, but it's better.",

Have a nice day/evening\" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day he shouted out to me, \"Come here, Miss Pretentious,\" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, \"What did you call me?\" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the \"culture of the building\" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, \"Hello, Miss Pretentious\" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I should probably talk to him and tell him I don't appreciate being called that, but honestly I just want to report him to his supervisor as I'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). So WIBTA if I just go ahead and report him? I don't want to get him fired or anything, but I do want him to stop.",

    "body": "I am from a small non-English speaking country, but my partner is American and we live in the US. We have a five-year-old daughter who is in kindergarten this year. I almost always speak to my child in my native language. It's important to me that she learns my native language.\n\nWe've taken the approach of \"Don't explicitly correct when Daughter confuses the languages\". For example, if she says \"I want M\u00ebllech\" instead of \"I want milk\", we ask \"Oh, do you want milk?\" instead of \"Not M\u00ebllech, milk.\" She doesn't get words confused as much anymore, but it does still happen.\n\nLast week, she came home from school and has absolutely refused to speak anything but English, and was much, much quieter than normal. If I spoke to her in my native language, she would respond in English. I tried to read a book with her, and she started crying. I asked her why, and she said that she \"had to speak English\". After some more coaxing, she told me her teacher had told her she could only speak English because my language had \"naughty words\" and punished her by taking away recess.\n\nI was furious, but I talked to her teacher the next day. She told me that my daughter was cursing in class and I needed to talk to her about appropriate language. I asked what words she was saying exactly, and was told \"ass\". Now, \"ass\" is \"is\" in my native language, and is pronounced more like \"ahs\" than the English word. I figured out that my daughter was switching \"ass\" and \"is\", and the teacher thought she was swearing at everybody.\n\nI explained what I thought was happening to the teacher, and explained how to correct Daughter, and said that we would be more vigilant at home. The teacher absolutely refused and insisted that I stop speaking to Daughter in my native language because it was obviously confusing her and affecting her English ability. I told her nevermind and that she should leave all correction to to me and my husband, and that if I heard anything more from my daughter, I would be filing a complaint with the principal. She had no right to tell me how to raise my child, and to make my child cry for mixing up a word.\n\nI was telling my friend about the incident, and she says that I made too much of a scene. I shouldn't threaten the teacher for trying to correct my daughter. But we've tried very hard to make both languages equal for my daughter, and now that work was undone by someone who apparently can't understand that a young child will mix up words sometimes. But I admit I was very angry in the moment and maybe wasn't thinking as I would if I was calm.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. I am definitely continuing to teach my daughter my language. That was never up for debate. I was just wondering if I had been too harsh with the teacher. I've been speaking to my husband about the situation, and we've agreed that we will go in and speak with the principal. And we've both sat down with our daughter and talked to her about what is happening. I think it will take some time though.",

I, the husband, am asking if I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nThis is a topic we\u2019ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It\u2019d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. \n\nMy perspective (husband):\n\nMy wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. \n\nAfter eating something delicious, I can\u2019t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I\u2019m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. \n\nOver the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn\u2019t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. \n\nOnce they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife\u2019s contractions started to pick up. \n\nAm I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?\n\nWife\u2019s perspective:\n\nMy husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he\u2019d complain I\u2019d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. \n\nSo as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn\u2019t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \n\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \n\nI\u2019d like to also mention it wasn\u2019t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \n\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",

The final straw was after the test drive (of course he gave the keys to my BF), I said that I really liked the guy and he turned to my BF and asked if he should get the paperwork ready.\n\nI interjected and said I wanted to think about it.

My boyfriend could tell I was a bit upset about this interaction and offered to go to another dealership with me tomorrow or leave a review or something.\n\nSo we left and came back the next morning, a different salesperson greeted us and this one was much better, ridiculously charming, flattered me by saying a hard working woman like me deserved a good car and all the flattery I was expecting when being sold to. \n\nI told him we'd driven the car yesterday and decided to buy it and we did, no hassles. I even managed to negotiate some extras since I told him I was giving him a sale for very little effort on his part.\n\nI was recounting this story to a friend of mine yesterday who is sales (but in IT) told me I was a bit of an asshole because the previous salesman had done all the work and I gave the sale to someone else when I was wanting to buy the car anyway. \n\nHe said I should have asserted myself a bit more on the spot and given the previous salesman more of a chance rather than try to screw him over behind his back because now he'd never know why he'd lost the sales. He also said that sales was a tough job and maybe old habits die hard. Or if I didn't want to buy from him at all, I should have given him a concrete reason so he could learn.\n\nI think my thing is, it's 2020 and it's basic sales 101 to speak to the person who holds the purse-strings.

I taught my daughter how to drive, and was with her when she got her license last month. Last week, my daughter came home with a ticket for texting and driving on the highway. This caused a huge concern for me. The ticket included a $200 fine and a 20 day suspension of her license.\n\nI was obviously very upset and we got into an argument about it. Her points were that \"everyone does it\" and that she doesn't do that often, or when other cars are around. Not only was she defending herself, but she was essentially arguing that she does it safely. I told her that regardless of when the suspension kicks in, she is grounded from driving until she has shown that she can be responsible enough to not put her own life, or the other lives on the road, in danger. I took her car keys (a car that I had bought for her as a getting-your-license present).\n\nShe went and called her mom before I did, and next thing I know, I have her calling me and telling me that I had no right to punish her like that without talking to her first. I agreed that I should have talked to her first about it, but that I feel like the grounding is nonnegotiable. Her mom actually took her side, and said the same \"everyone does it\" bullshit, and that she needs a car to get to work and hang out with friends. I told her that it is ridiculous that she is even supporting this. The conversation ended with her telling me that she wasn't going to enforce the rule, and would allow her to drive one of her cars at her house.\n\nI waited a few days, until it was her mom's turn of custody. I called her and she confirmed that she isn't backing off, and that she is going to let her drive until the suspension kicks in. I told her that she is actively letting our child endanger her life as well as everyone else's. She told me I am making this a much bigger deal out than it needs to be, and she said that if it was actually that serious, she would have gotten more than a 20 day suspension.\n\nIn my state, the parent that signed the minor-driving consent form when you get your license has the ability to have your license revoked, so I did just that. They warned me that this will count as a full revocation on her record, and that she will be ineligible to get it again until she is 18. I went through with it and texted her mother to tell her that I revoked her license, and sent her a picture of the paper the DMV sent me. She told me I am out of line and making decisions for our daughter without consulting her. I told her that she was neglecting her safety and I wasn't going to allow her to enable our daughter to endanger herself or someone else on the road. My daughter is livid at me, and so is her mom, but I feel like I did what I had to do.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Reply notifications are turned off.

His mother has struggled with drug addiction and hasn't been in his life since he was an infant. When he asked about his mom in the past I would just tell him that she wasn't able to take care of him the way he needed to be taken care of. He pushed for more information a couple weeks ago. He asked why he had to live with his grandmother before living with me. I told him, \"Because your mom and I weren't talking when she was pregnant with you. I didn't know she had you until your grandmother told me. After that I did everything I could to get you.\" He asked if he would ever be able to see his mom again. I said, \"I don't know. I don't even know where she is. She has a sickness called addiction. Sometimes when people are sick like that they make decisions that no one understands. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you though.\" He cried, I felt bad, and my mom told me I told him way too much information. I came here looking for judgement.\n\nUpdate: I was overwhelmed by the amount of replies. I did get a lot of people calling it a validation post. I didn't mean for it to be but it was nice to see so many people say that I wasn't the asshole. It gave me some more confidence in my parenting. I don't know much about kids or parenting and am kind of learning on the fly here. Seeing his and my mom's reactions made me think I ruined my son's innocence. I have decided to get some parenting counseling for myself to help me navigate different challenges. For my son, I talked to him about joining a group for kids who have parents that struggle with addiction. We have a center here that does a weekly group session for kids. They separate it by grade so my son will be with about 10 kids around his age dealing with the same thing. The coordinator said the group has everyone from kids who have never met their drug addicted parent to kids who see their drug addicted parent everyday to kids who have lost parents to addiction. My son is very interested and I am glad he'll be able to see that he isn't the only kid dealing with this.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented.

Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. \n\nThis past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It\u2019s the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one\u2019s college fund as well but didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need your money.\u201d\n\nI kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I\u2019ve been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.\n\n(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)\n\n(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn\u2019t quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious \u201c designer\u201d brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn\u2019t looked it up I don\u2019t think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",

    "body": "Throwaway because all parties know my account name.\n\nBackstory: My boyfriend (Alex\\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I\u2019ve become friends with his two best friends (James\\* and Noah\\*) but we\u2019re not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.\n\nSituation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.\n\nThree nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn\u2019t move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.\n\nJames messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had \u201cpromised\u201d two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it\u2019s a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn\u2019t want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.\n\nAm I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?\n\n2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn\u2019t considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don\u2019t know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn\u2019t stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can\u2019t use my discount in the way that I did. He said he\u2019s just going to let it play out but he\u2019ll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be getting one. \nFor anyone asking or not believing the story because of this: I don\u2019t know the story of the concert, this is the story as I know it from my point of view. They\u2019re going to see SKEPTA.",

    "body": "I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. This pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, I wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. During the newborn phase, I was SO exhausted. I was breastfeeding, baby had colic, I was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. I do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and I was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).\n\nMy husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. He would silently be ticked if I asked him to not go to the gym. I truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). But sometimes, that \"help\" wasn't enough. Sometimes, I NEEDED another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. Example: one Saturday I got up to pump. They were both awake (8:00am). He said he was going to head to the gym since I was awake, and I started crying saying \"please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and I got maybe three hours or so of sleep\" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me \"sleep in.\" I told him that it must be nice to even have the ENERGY to go to the gym. The ONLY thing I wanted to be able to do was sleep. I got the response \"I'm sorry you hate being a mom!\"\n\nNow that I'm pregnant again, I mentioned to him \"if I thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am I supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?\" I told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. Well, he did not receive this kindly. He texted me the next day \"Just to be clear, I feel like I do a lot. I will not be able to help out with daycare, as I drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. I will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and I need to go to relieve stress. The reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while I think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. You need to think about if you want this baby. \"\n\nI fucking lost it.\n\nI said \"I cannot believe you would rather me have an abortion than make any more sacrifices regarding your gym time.\" But he is adamant that I am the selfish one\n\nETA: I work full time when not on maternity leave (6-8 weeks)\n\nETA: People seem to think I'm bitter because I'm out of shape, and that's not true. I am a runner and try to run at least 15-20 miles a week (on my own time, immediately after work while my daughter is still in daycare). \n\nETA: He left work early today to get his work out in so he could be home with us this evening. He picked up dinner, helped feed the baby, played with her outside & is giving her a bath now. This is DEF not the norm, but I think maybe he\u2019s realized what an ass he\u2019s been. Still need to have a convo, probably with a counselor, but, things are looking up?",

Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. \n\nShe came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked \u201care there any girls I should be worried about\u201d This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn\u2019t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nEverything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. \n\nGF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. \n\nI apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said \u201cno worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes\u201d (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I didn\u2019t tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. \n\nWe got into the biggest argument about how I didn\u2019t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can\u2019t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. \n\nShe\u2019s now back on a plane, and we will \u201cdiscuss further\u201d once she clears her head.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. \n\nEdit 2: update: I\u2019ve gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. I admitted that I\u2019m an asshole for how I\u2019ve gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. I adore her, but I\u2019m not comfortable with the default response being \u201cI\u2019m jealous, I\u2019m going to be rude to someone I don\u2019t know\u201d \n\nShe is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always \u201cchoose\u201d the other girl. I tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that I can\u2019t do anything about that, but I do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. Every one of them, and I definitely think she can recover. But she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it\u2019s probably not going to developed past this. \n\nFor the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren\u2019t strictly platonic. Yes, I understand her comment was towards me. Plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess I should take a page out of his book. ",

    "body": "Going to try to make this quick. I'm 22 and my sister is 18. I went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and I notice she has Facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. I have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. I know I shouldn't have but I snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake Facebook profile of me.\n\nI'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. I don't do social media. I'm a private person and I don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. Some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. Other pictures that she had were ones I had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.\n\nI delete all of the pictures and I check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food I had taken pictures of. I go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that I had taken for my boyfriend.\n\nI deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. I uploaded a single picture of her with the caption \"The real me\", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. I've heard her sobbing from her room all day but I'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. AITA for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I decided to confront my sister since I couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. As soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. I told her that I don't think I could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. I asked her why she had the fake profile. Apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. He really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. She got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. I brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. I told her that I didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. I asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that I can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. She tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. At that point I just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. I told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. She got upset again and I left shortly after. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw people mentioning that I should change my password on my computer- I've done that. I've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which I'm probably going to take him up on. I can't be in the house anymore- I feel so uncomfortable and I feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for people that have sent kind words/messages/advice. I really appreciate it. Today has been the worst day of my life, hands down. The relationship with my sister will never be the same and I don't think the uneasiness will ever go away.",

We were discussing how expensive they are etc and we got onto the subject of \"menstrual cups\" (the ones where you can just keep reusing them, so it would save us so much money in the long run.

Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...\n\nHe was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I\u2019d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child\u2019s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn\u2019t an option. \n\nI myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it\u2019s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.\n\nAfter begging him to be in the baby\u2019s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.\n\nAt first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.\n\nI took sole custody of course. It\u2019s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven\u2019t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. \n\nI get a call and it\u2019s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can\u2019t just say no because he\u2019s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. \n\nI was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he\u2019s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. \n\nI\u2019ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I\u2019m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this.

Any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. We were having a blast which was great because I really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom).

We always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but I never really thought much of it. About 5 months ago, John came out to me and I was completely supportive, but to be honest I started to consider some of his actions in a new light. \n\nFor example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. I am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. Also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if I ever spend time with a girl over him. He always says things like \"you don't care about me anymore!\", seemingly just to get me to say that I do. It's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly I am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.\n\nI told him about a month ago that I would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. He was upset, and again it was about how I am trying to push him away. We haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that I addressed.\n\nI feel like I can't put up with this anymore. I want it to be clear that I have **no issue** with him being gay, but I would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.\n\nWIBTA if I ended this friendship?",

    "body": "My ex husband and I divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. It was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. I could have her every other weekend. Our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. Depression hit me hard and I became an alcoholic. I willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. From then on, I strived to improve my life. I did AA, went to rehab and I've been sober for a long time now. By the time my daughter was 9, I was completely sober. I looked forward to our visits. I was really heartbroken that I didn't get much time with her. \n\nHe remarried and I was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. But over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. She called her mom( I don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). She completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. I could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. I was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.\n\nAt her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and I only got one picture with her. I was crushed. And when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. That broke my heart. She did not contact me much after that.\n\nI moved to a different state after that. Moved on with my life and I met an amazing man who is now my husband. We have a daughter together. I've completely moved on and I don't resent anyone. I have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. I'm content. I don't regret or resent anything. \n\nRecently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. She's 28 now. According to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. She fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. She's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. She apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. According to her, her mother manipulated her. \n\nIdk. I don't feel any connection between us now. Honestly, I've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. I don't want to open that wound ever. I don't think it will do any good for my mental health and I'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. I don't think I can or should have her back in my life. WIBTA here??\n\nEdit: I've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. But my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. He tried to help her out but she never improved. So he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. He adviced me not to take her in. He doesn't know that she's pregnant.\n\nEdit2: I'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. I'm not letting her stay with me for now. I have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. Thanks for all the replies. ( And I learned the spelling of lose.)",

About 30 minutes later, I get a notification that the delivery guy is approaching with our order. Without a word she dashes out of the front room, I'm confused, but the doorbell rings, so I go answer it. \n\nOnce she hears the door close, she saunters back into the room, grabs the food from me and starts pulling out items. Still confused, I ask; \n\n\"What was that all about.\" \n\nShe then tells me that she doesn't like to be seen when delivery guys are at the door, because \"they always hit on her.\" She then shows me a group of saved messages from delivery drivers/service workers asking her out. Apparently it's a common occurrence for her. \n\nI was shocked, and we get into a conversation about how inappropriate it is for them to do that. At some point in the conversation she says; \n\n\"That's one of the drawbacks to being really pretty. I mean if I wasn't so obviously out of your league, then I'm sure you would hit on me all the time\" \n\nI laughed, because I thought she was joking. But she kept pushing this point, so I responded with; \n\n\"Honestly, you're not that attractive, a lot of guys are just desperate, and they probably think they have a chance with a girl who looks like you.\" \n\nShe tried to laugh it off as well, but the rest of the night was pretty awkward, and we haven't really spoken to each other since. \n\nTL;DR - My friend who is constantly being hit on told me I was out of her league. I told her she wasn't as attractive as she thought she was. We haven't spoken since.",

    "body": "So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun. \n\nFast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:\n\nHer photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.\n\nMy photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.\n\nAs soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.\n\n**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**\n\n**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",

My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.\n\nUp until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!\n\nI felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.\n\nAITA?",

    "body": "I was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while I was working at my desk, but when I got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. I was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while I was working just because I was the nearest available man, so I refused. The other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought I was joking, so I kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. I thought one of them should have done it in the first place.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: To clarify, the women in the break room weren\u2019t on official breaks. They just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. There are no official break times in my workplace. Also, I was working on something at my desk when I was asked to lift said object.\n\nEdit 2: At the time of being asked, I was asked to help \u201clift something\u201d in the break room. I assumed it was a package of mail or paper and I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be doing it myself, nor did I know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.\n\nEdit 3: This was not the first time in the day I refilled the dispenser. I\u2019m the closest man who sits near the break room, so I\u2019m regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. However, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn\u2019t exactly petite either \u2014 none of them in the break room are. Furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it\u2019s placed on the dispenser. I have also witnessed a 4\u201911\u201d woman change the bottle, so height isn\u2019t exactly much of an issue here.\n\nEdit 4: The woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. She is also married with children and I\u2019m the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, I highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.\n\nEdit 5: I never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume I did. I just refused to do the task for her.\n\nEdit 6: I am not the strongest person in the office \u2014 far from it. I don\u2019t lift weights and stay slim out of preference. We even have some female gym fanatics here. Also, I barely know the woman who asked me. She\u2019s in another department in another part of the office.\n\nUPDATE: I very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. She still defends chivalry, while I obviously find it illogical. Our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. Yes, everything I posted happened almost a decade ago. Our discovery sparked a heated discussion and I wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others\u2019 viewpoints to close our debate. I put little effort in my original post without thinking I\u2019d get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.\n\nI\u2019m still employed with this company, and some involved have left. If there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. I\u2019m glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. It\u2019s no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and I am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. Our head of HR also announced in a staff meeting that we\u2019ll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they\u2019ve even made positive changes at home as well \u2014 all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",

They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. It's just how they do it. \n\nI have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot of joy.\n\nAnyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though, she asked me where I got them and if the person has an \"Etsy\" shop or something where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. \n\nNow... personally I have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). It's just not done. \n\nI told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me \"Well let her make that decision!\" and stuff like that. \n\nI got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to HR about me being racially discriminating.\n\nAITA? \n\nMy reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make \"boho style\" earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",

My parents had been offering to throw me a party at home, and I had said yes at first, I'd like to have five of my female friends over for a girls night, just a chill night with dinner and sitting out by the fire and hanging out to catch up. We are all going to college next year in different places and time to just chill with my friend group is super special to me.\n\nThen my parents got carried away with planning a party, they wanted to invite three families that we're \"family friends\" with... AKA the parents are friends and the kids are put together out of convenience, despite none of us getting along or having much of anything in common, plus the older ones like me always end up stuck babysitting.\n\nI said no, I just want a low key party with my five friends, I don't want a bunch of my parents friends and their kids there. I want the party to be just a girls night, no children or guys because it changes the chill mood. I don't want a big production, just a chill night.\n\nBut my parents were adamant that the \"family friends\" were invited, even though I'm in the family, and none of them are my friends. Coming up to the day of the party, I could not convince them otherwise.\n\nSo my friends hatched a plan, they'd come to my house early in one of their cars and \"kidnap\" me from the party before it started.\n\nWe did that, and right after leaving the house I told my parents by a voicemail that I wanted to just have a chill night with the girls and they could have their party but don't pretend it's for me. And don't worry, we were just going out to eat, no drinking, nothing crazy. And I'd be home by midnight. \n\nThen my friends and I turned phones off for the night. \n\nIt was really wonderful, just what I wanted. It was the best birthday party ever, I was so grateful that my friends put the whole thing together for me.\n\nBut my parents were furious when I got home, I had embarrassed them to the community, I had left without saying where I was or picking up my phone and that scared them, they'd called my friends families and nobody could get in touch with us, the party was a disaster because it was so humiliating to throw a birthday party without the birthday girl, etc.\n\nI said that I'd told them so many times that I didn't want that party, they should have been warned that it wasn't a good idea from that. And that they ought to find some friends who aren't so judgy, because this whole \"keeping up with the Joneses\" game was getting old. And they wouldn't have to do it if they could just find some real friends. Like good friends who don't play these show-offy games.\n\nMy mom got mad at me for insulting their frienships, on top of everything else.

    "body": "So as I write this I'm feeding my 7 week old son. I am totally in love with him, he is amazing. However... The process of bringing him into the world was not good. At. All.\n\nIn order to explain why i might be an asshole I think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.\n\nI had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that I weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before I conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). I could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and I got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.\n\nThen came labour and delivery. I was in labour for 92 hours. My son was back to back, so i was in agony. I had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. In the end his heart rate dropped and I had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.\n\nI ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. My son was ill following delivery and ended up in the NICU for a few days. I had issues breastfeeding once he was out of NICU, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. I spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.\n\nOnce home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.\n\nHe's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.\n\n\n\n\nSo why AITA?\n\nWell, before I got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. Which, pardon my French, is bollocks. I still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe I could mentally deal with another pregnancy.\n\nPart of the reason I think I have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues I had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. Nobody told me that everything can go wrong. I didn't expect my birth plan to go as I hoped, but i thought I might get some things I wanted. I never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. I didn't prepare for him being ill. I didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.\n\nSo when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, I was totally honest.\n\nI didn't sugar coat anything. I explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. I have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, I probably won't be doing it again.\n\nWell my friends have said that I'm an asshole for being so honest as I've put them off having children in the future. I didn't mean to scare them, but I felt that I would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.\n\nI don't feel like I should apologise or say that I exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nSo reddit AITA?",

Plus I'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.\n\nAfter I gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. Here enters Pretentious Music Snob (PMS), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.\n\nPMS: (asking me) How much did you get it for?\n\nMe: 60 dollars.\n\nPMS: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. It's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.\n\nI thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.\n\nMy friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. \n\nPMS: The speakers sound pretty crap.\n\nFriend: I think it sounds fine.\n\nPMS: You know what you can do? You should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. Here's the setup I have at home. (Pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) The one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.\n\nAt this point I was pretty annoyed. He might be right, but I think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when I was right next to him. So I decided to call him out.\n\nMe: Hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (Yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)\n\nThe room became silent and it got pretty awkward. I know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling PMS out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but I reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I posted this before going to bed (I live in Australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but Holy Crap this blew up. Here's some additional info:\n\nWhen birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. So when PMS was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. \n\nTo be honest I'm not a confrontational person and I wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. I said what I said to A) shut him up, I wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes B) Yes I said it in a way that embarrassed him. I'm not a saint, I didn't take the high road, but I sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. \n\nWhen I said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. I've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since PMS was also annoying him. \n\nI posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that I didn't over escalate it. My conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and I don't regret what I did.",

I was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. I don't really have a great relationship with Ashley, so I was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. About an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. Apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.\n\nMy car is a new Mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. I absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. I asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. So, I told her I would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. \n\nShe starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister ASAP. I told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, I don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. She asked if I could drive her to get her and I told her I had too much wine to drive. She then proceeds to shit on me for being \"irresponsible\" for drinking and not anticipating I might have to drive, as well as \"selfish\" for not letting her take my car.\n\nWhen they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how I wouldn't let her take mine. She goes on about how my \"fancy car is more important than a child in crisis\". I told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. \n\nMy in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. When my husband was driving us home he told me I made the right call because Ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast.

    "body": "So my 15 year old daughter is in her first \"serious\" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  I put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  My daughter and I have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  I am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.\n\nThe problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  He calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  She has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  He has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  She recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.\n\nShe sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  I was very proud of the way she handled it.  We have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  I think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.\n\nLast night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying \"Babe, call me\" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  It was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  He then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  He then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  She.  Is.  Done.\n\nAs a mom, I would want to know if my son (13M) was treating someone like this.  I recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  WIBTA for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  We have chatted in the past, and I have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  Or would I be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:  I talked with my daughter tonight and told her that I was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (For the record, I would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  I respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  I explained that I don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and I am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  But I have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  I am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.\n\nShe was not upset at all and said she understood why I would want to call his mom.  She asked that I wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  We agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by Friday, I will make the call.  As a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  She is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, for those of you who have asked... From a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  We never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  When problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  So her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  I'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",

    "body": "I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.\n\nI'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.\n\nWhen my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?\n\nTheir answer was \"yes\", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.\n\nThey've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.\n\nWe would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.\n\nI'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice \"hehe we get a bigger house if we lie\", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?\n\nWould I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.\n\nOur other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children \"why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom\", etc. \"Because they're having children\" can't be our reasoning anymore.",

    "body": "Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn\u2019t allowed to cut my hair, ever, because \u201chair is a woman\u2019s crown\u201d. It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I\u2019ve either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that\u2019s a big reason I\u2019m so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I\u2019m bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. \n\nOne of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she\u2019s always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn\u2019t want to get a wig, and we\u2019ve been on bad terms ever since.\n\nAll of our friends are on her side because \u201cit\u2019s just a wig\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she\u2019s not the one being unreasonable.\u201d And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I\u2019m posting here. \n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I\u2019ve already paid for a bridesmaid\u2019s dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who\u2019s going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I\u2019ll never wear again when I\u2019ve already spent a ton? Not really.\n\nAlso, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I\u2019m already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. \n\nMy biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I\u2019m the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don\u2019t have hair, which I personally don\u2019t think is true. Is being bald so hideous I\u2019ll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the \u201cI want us to match\u201d thing is stupid. We\u2019re already wearing matching dresses, why isn\u2019t that enough? I know it\u2019s \u201cher day\u201d and we\u2019re supposed to make her happy, but isn\u2019t there a line? \n\nI\u2019ve offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she\u2019s not having it. I\u2019m still in the bridal party and invited but I don\u2019t know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?\n\nEDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She\u2019s not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I\u2019d also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it\u2019d still be really short though.",

I know they don\u2019t owe me a dime and I\u2019m grateful for everything they\u2019ve given me in life. \n\nI have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I\u2019m happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it\u2019s my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. \n\nMy sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn\u2019t have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they\u2019re great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. \n\nI know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn\u2019t want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don\u2019t blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. \n\nBut I\u2019m still upset that now I won\u2019t be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I\u2019m not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. \n\nWhen my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can\u2019t have a \u2018fancy wedding\u2019 (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she\u2019s sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I\u2019d hoped. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I\u2019m still getting married. My wedding won\u2019t compare to my sister\u2019s, but I\u2019m still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. \n\nThanks for sticking with me through the story.

I\u2019m of the opinion that they\u2019re all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it\u2019s that bad run to a KFC after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. It\u2019s also not like there won\u2019t be any meat - there\u2019ll be non veg food at the Sangeet, there\u2019ll be meat at the reception. \n\nAlso during the English wedding I sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being Hindus don\u2019t partake, but I told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. \n\nSo, WIBTA for not wanting meat at the wedding?",

As you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and I guess you can see where this is going. I hadn't been in my study a few weeks as I've been on an extended business trip, and when I come home to my study my poster is gone. I ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on eBay.\n\nHere's where it gets iffy. She claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, DESPITE it being so sentimental to me. The reason I am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. She tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure I behave myself).

    "body": "Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.\n\nCome us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her \"no\" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \\*can\\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?\n\nEdit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  \n\n\nEdit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  \n\n\nIn reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go. You guys have given me a lot to chew on, and I'd really like to thank you all.",

But as of now, I'm really early on in this whole process and I've only told my husband, who had been the only person to really notice I had a problem.\n\nLast week was my sister's wedding. We aren't too close, she's almost ten years older than me. I wasn't in the bridal party, she had a small party of her friends. I wasn't upset or insulted by that.\n\nAt the wedding, there was an open bar, champagne at every table, and pretty much everyone was drinking. \n\nI got myself a glass of water and I felt like I stood out a little for not drinking. A couple people offered me drinks, my brother, my uncle and aunt, even family of the groom who were mingling with us. I'd always decline politely, \"no thanks\" \"I'm good for now\" Nobody asked any questions for a while. \n\nUntil it was time for speeches and toasts. \n\nMy aunt was pouring out champagne for everyone and I was like \"no thanks\" and she asked \"Oh why not?\"\n\nI didn't want to say much so I was just like \"oh just for personal reasons, I'm not drinking right now\" and she was like \"Are you...\" And wiggled her eyebrows in a way that seemed to mean something.\n\nI had no fucking idea what she was getting at. The anxious part of my brain was filling that empty space with questions like \"Are you an alcoholic?\" \"Are you afraid you're gonna binge drink if you start drinking?\" Etc...\n\nI know how dumb it sounds that I didn't realize, all I can say is that none of my friends or close family have kids, I don't think much about what signals a pregnancy. But I've had a couple people in my life get sober because of drinking problems. So that's the connection that I saw as obvious.\n\nI just froze up and shrugged awkwardly.\n\nI didn't think any more about it until later. My husband came to me and said that people were congratulating him on the baby. I was like \"what the fuck, what baby?\" And he was like \"yeah I asked the same thing, apparently your aunt is going around saying we're expecting. I was baffled.\n\nIt was only later that i understood. My sister came to me furious at stealing the spotlight from her on her wedding day, being jealous I'm not in the wedding party, making drama by making people think I was pregnant when I'm not, being all coy about not drinking when \"everyone knows what that means\" \n\nI told her that I wasn't drinking because I've had a drinking problem for a while, and needed to stop. And she just didn't believe me. She said that the timing was too convenient, that she's never seen a problem before, and that I was obviously bitter that I'm not the center of attention for once.\n\nI didn't know what else to say or how to make her understand.\n\nAITA for making people assume i was pregnant?",

We had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. He said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do because he\u2019s not ready to be a father. His girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there\u2019s not anything he can do.\n\nI asked him how could this happen; why wasn\u2019t she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and ESPECIALLY, why isn\u2019t he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. He said that his girlfriend\u2019s parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and I quote \u201cCondoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag.\u201d Apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because \u201ctogether, it\u2019s almost impossible to get pregnant.\u201d\n\nI was **infuriated**. I\u2019ve talked to him ALL the time about safe sex. We\u2019re no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he\u2019d start having sex. Which is why we emphasized being *safe*. We\u2019ve just have had this conversation so many times; I was just so. Angry. That my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. \n\nI told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. Effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. Additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he\u2019s effectively grounded until the end of the year. He can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. He can also only do this only when we\u2019re home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). That means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. If he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we\u2019ll use find my iPhone to track him. He said he understood.\n\nHe came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. He asked now that she\u2019s not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and I want to stick to our guns on this. Though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. But he\u2019s shown us he\u2019s downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. \n\nMy son maintains that we\u2019re being WAY to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he\u2019s also said in the past that he\u2019d never have sex without a condom because \u201che\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d We just plainly cannot trust him right now. Are we being unreasonable?\n\nEDIT: The work thing would've just been for the summer.

    "body": "Background: Our 4yo daughter has febrile seizures, which cause her body temp to spike during fevers, resulting in a short seizure. My wife has an anxiety disorder and becomes easily overwhelmed under stress. \n\nAfter her first seizing episode, we went to a neurologist who diagnosed the febrile seizures. His directions for responding to a seizure were to strip our daughter down, put a cool cloth on her body, and wait for her temperature to drop. Then pump her full of Motrin to manage the fever. He said, while scary, the seizures were harmless and she would grow out of them. No long-term effects, no worry of anything beyond 5 minutes of shaking while her body cooled itself down. \n\nSince then, we\u2019ve experienced about 6 seizures, 4 of which I was home for. I followed the neurologist\u2019s directions and we got through the seizures like a breeze. In a matter of minutes, she was up and wanting to play again. My wife\u2019s initial reaction, however, was to cuddle our daughter in the bed, which actually increased her body temp. In each case, I had to argue with my wife to let go of our daughter so I could cool her down. The cuddling was a result of my wife\u2019s anxiety and her need to soothe herself by nurturing our sick daughter. I get that, but it was the opposite of what we needed to do in that moment. \n\nOn the 2 occasions I wasn\u2019t home for the seizures, my wife called 911 and an ambulance came. Both times, I rushed home to inform the 1st responders about her condition and instructed them on how to cool her down. Both times they recommended taking her to the ER, and both times we ended up paying $1000 for a 4-hour ER visit where they gave her nothing more than a dose of children\u2019s Motrin. \n\nAITA for telling my wife that we need to follow our neurologist\u2019s directions instead of calling 911 and racking up unnecessary medical bills? I showed her the most recent bill and she accused me of caring more about money than her mental health or our daughter\u2019s health. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. In her words, it\u2019s worth $1000 for her (my wife) to be surrounded by medical professionals, and if I don\u2019t agree, then I\u2019m the bad guy. In my view, my wife needs to work with her therapist so she can better handle stress, and can follow our doctor\u2019s directions when our daughter has a seizure while I\u2019m not home.",

For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.\n\n\nI don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.\n\n\nWell, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.\n\n\nWell, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. \n\n\nWell when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no. So what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",

I pay for my own tuition, books, food, gas, car insurance, etc. This is not new.\n\nMy younger brother also lives with us (19) and just works BUT does not pay any rent. In fact my mother gives him money. It's like any money I give my mother goes directly to my other siblings and it's a point of contention. To make matters worse, she not only lies about my brother paying rent and not giving him money.\n\nMy mother discreetly dropped me off her work insurance plan. I only found out when I called her job up to get a new health insurance card and they told me that I was no longer on the plan anymore. That actually hurt that she did that. She is under financial stress right now because she is also supporting my loser sister, her baby daddy and they just had a kid.\n\nIn the past, I would give her T-1098 which is the tax form for college. It was of no value to me because I was listed as a dependent (which was required to get health insurance under her job). Basically she would say that she paid for all of my tuition and books so she could get a bigger refund and more credits on her tax return even though I was the one who personally paid for all of my college expenses.\n\nShe asked me for my T-1098 from 2019 and I refused to give it to her. Since she kicked me off her insurance because she couldn't afford it (and didn't bother telling she did that), I am now deemed an independent and I am filing my taxes as such. She blew up at me saying that things are financially tight and tried modifying our rental agreement to where she would claim my college expenses as her own. I won't budge. I would actually get a big enough refund to cover next semester's tuition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My mother's employer pays 100% of her insurance and like 50% for dependents. She had the high-end plan. It's not \"free.\" I ended up getting insurance through my part-time job, which costs me $100 a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I told my mother that I would be happy to give her my tax papers and whatever extra she gets can be used for rent.

My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. \n\nMy son is obsessed with his bike and loves it.

    "body": "I love birds, and I'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. I've had them for about a year and a half. When I first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.\n\nShe then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. She got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. \n\nEvery time I went over to her house, I told her that it needed more attention. It just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. Its food and water were probably only changed once a week. It was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.\n\nI told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. And despite promising to do better, she never did. \n\nI asked her if I could have it. She got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. \n\nI felt really horrible every time I went over there. I decided I wanted to steal it. I felt like I could give it a better life. It could even make friends with my 2 birds. I just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. \n\nSo I did it. She was in the bathroom, and I took a shoe box I had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. It was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. I left without even saying goodbye. \n\nSoon after I got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. I said that I'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. She once again used the argument of, \"Its my bird, I can do what I want with it.\"\n\nI took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. It began chirping for the first time I had ever heard. It seemed very happy. \n\nThis was all 3 days ago. My friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying I'm being an asshole. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so huge. \n\nI honestly went into this thinking I was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. She didn't. Like I said, I would have given it back if she had. \n\nI guess I just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. Which now, after reading the comments, I understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. \n\nToday I offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. She took it and is letting me keep the bird. But she still hates me. Honestly, at this point, I couldn't care less. The bird is safe. That's all that matters.\n\nI think I could've handled it better, but I don't regret my choices. Thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",

    "body": "I have a friend, Bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. He\u2019s quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he\u2019s a solid guy and he\u2019s good to spend time with. We met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. First year we lived together, and have stayed friends since I moved out. After the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. He\u2019s not completely without his sight so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it\u2019s just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he\u2019s not allowed to drive or get his license. He\u2019s completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can\u2019t drive. He\u2019s always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he\u2019d travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.\n\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. As is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and Bobby received both. Because I\u2019m not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. We had a few people who missed the RSVP date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. The RSVP date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. \n\n\nBackground backgrounded. Now for the potential assholery.\n\n\nBobby also missed the RSVP date. He wasn\u2019t the only one I had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. Today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he\u2019s messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. The reason for his plus one is his eyesight. Because he doesn\u2019t drive and he\u2019s not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. I flat out told him no, he\u2019s not inviting his mum as a plus one because we\u2019ve already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she\u2019s welcome at the rest of the day. \nThe hotel in reality doesn\u2019t need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there\u2019s no easy space to slot her in, and I don\u2019t want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. I now doubt whether he\u2019ll come, because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.\n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n*Edit:* A few things to update here. I\u2019ve been chatting to the friend more. Despite what you all think, I do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can\u2019t be put across in a AITA post. The mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. And by the tone of Bobbys message, it wasn\u2019t Bobby asking for his mum to be there, but Bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. Ceremony and evening do is fine, and I told Bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. I\u2019ve since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that\u2019s on site.\n\nAdditionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. It\u2019s either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can\u2019t/won\u2019t drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. The bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. It\u2019s only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. Travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and Bobby has been invited to use them from the start.\n\nTo those saying he needs eyes for the evening. I\u2019m not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if I am still an asshole. I\u2019m saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn\u2019t need his mother there. There are plenty of college friends there, who he\u2019s seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. It\u2019s a group of friends and we\u2019ve all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as I said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).\n\nI can live with being judged an asshole, but felt there was more information available that was affecting my decision, that wasn\u2019t available to the jury.",

The rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. So essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (I slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but I mean going out alone without third wheel).\n\nI decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and I confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. I guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me I should probably talk to him because I felt she was lying. So I went out on a \"walk to the shops\" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.\n\nStraight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as I was. Except she lied and said I purposely told her I couldn't afford a room and she \"had to offer me her place\". This isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and I never insinuated I wouldn't get a hotel room. She told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. They had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. A lot more than she did with me. I felt heartbroken, still do but I'm feeling better. On this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. He does really like her, I'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, She never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, I told him he could have her.\n\nSo yeah. In essence, she lied a lot. She told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. Was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. She told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. She told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while I was also there. It's shit.\n\nShit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen.

She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real \u201cmother\u201d  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.\n\nAbout a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn\u2019t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer\u2019s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. \n\nFast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma\u2019s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fianc\u00e9e multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she\u2019s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn\u2019t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. \n\nShe ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fianc\u00e9e she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.\n\nSo yeah that\u2019s the back story.

It must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. \n\n\nI am still still standing firm to our promise.

Well she recognized me and I tried to pretend I didn't notice her, but she called my name. \n\nSo shit...I awkwardly say hi, and she asks me the usual chit chat. Well after a few minutes the ice has broken, and she gives me a full apology. She says how she is sorry and she regrets it etc. Then she says \"so we're cool now?

They both (politely) excused themselves afterwards and drove over to my place to talk about it. My Dad drove my half of the groceries to my cousin's place and then came back. There's now a massive feud on our family WhatsApp with two groups:\n\n1) Family who are sticking up for me and telling other people to stop provoking me (mostly older relatives).\n\n2) People who are saying I'm an asshole (mostly the younger generation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousin and her boyfriend (soon-to-be-married) were having their baby shower and the whole family was invited to the party. My mother and aunts love to cook so they wanted to gather the ingredients and make a huge dinner themselves. I drove my car and my father drove his, and we basically pushed the shopping carts along and got our credit cards ready while the women shoveled everything they wanted into the carriages.\n\nWe finally got everything to my cousin's place and we started off-loading my Dad's car first. While I was inside, I got a chance to say hi to my cousin to congratulate her on her baby shower. The conversation started off light, but took a weird turn. She asked me how my parents raised me, and specific details like if they grounded me, what kinds of punishment they used, what I did when I was little and what regrets I had as a kid that I would change. I thought they were trying to learn how to raise their child, but it was weird because I'm a single guy. They would've been better off asking my parents about these things.\n\nHere's where things get dark. I ask my cousin why she's asking me all this, and she says, \"I just want to raise my baby better than you,\" That made no sense because I never raised any babies. The vibe I got was definitely that it was an insult but on the off-chance she wasn't intentionally being rude, I just laughed it off and said, \"Well I'm no Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, but I do alright for,\" I assumed she meant that she wanted to raise her baby to be better than me, which is fine since parents want the world for their kids.\n\nNope, she just kept going. \"Well that's true. Did your parents ever think you'd turn out this way?\"\n\nI said, \"Well I think they just wanted me to be happy,\"\n\nHer, \"Are you?\"\n\nMe, \"Well I'm definitely happy for you, congratulations!\" (I'm trying reaaaaaaally hard to steer things away from me).\n\nHer, \"Thanks. Do you ever plan on having kids?\"\n\nMe, \"I just gotta find the right person, but until then I'm gonna enjoy life as is. There's no need to stress out wanting something else and taking what we have for granted.\"\n\nHer, \"Sure... Well I'm younger than you and I already have a family. Don't wait too long... or else you might ending up dying alone,\" I ask her directly what she meant. She just laughs, shrugs, and leaves. I her again and she says, \"Don't get angry at me, you're the one who refuses to go out and meet people. If you bothered to leave your house every once in a while maybe you'd have a family of your own by now. I just don't want my baby to end up like you,\"\n\nEveryone within earshot was dead-silent. I just stared at her for who knows how long and she just ends up rubbing her belly and waddling away.\n\nI leave, taking my car home and halfway there, I realize half the groceries are still in my car.

He confirmed that he had been under the assumption that he was since the start of the job and he had also been discussing details of the job with him as well. \nSo as you can expect I go and talk to my fathers friend and ask him if hes been pretending to be in charge. \nAnd he didn't even denay it and started trying to claim that he knows how to run a company better anyway. \nSo I fired him on the spot infrount of all the other staff and the client. And now I'm getting the 3rd degree from both parents. \nSo did I over react or what? \nP.s sorry for long post and possible bad spelling I'm dyslexic lol",

We could see everything clear as day. \n\nI know the woman, she is one of my wives friends. I laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn\u2019t bothered but inside I was a little WTF. \n\nI saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and I happened to sit on the same table. I tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, Sophia and I kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you\u2019re near the school it\u2019ll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? \n\nShe was very offended and told me I was being inappropriate and I was floored. I was even more floored when my wife agreed with her. I told my wife later that if it was a naked dude all hell would have already broken loose. She wants me to apologise to her friend. \n\nAITA?

    "body": "The MCAT is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the US. Applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.\n\nResults for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn\u2019t have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).\n\nSo when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  I asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. She had already sent out some primaries but haven\u2019t gotten any secondary applications back.\n\nShe was in near tears.

I was under the impression that my boyfriend is out, however I haven\u2019t met hus family yet (we are in California, his family is in Florida). He assured me that he is out of the closet. \n\nHe told me his parents are coming to visit us. Cool. No problem with me - my own parents have spent the night at our flat in the past. When I came back home from work, my boyfriend was tidying up the spare bedroom/office. Or so I thought. When I peeked in I noticed he moved some of my personal stuff that I keep in our bedroom to the spare bedroom. My entire nightstand for example, with my chargers and books. I asked him what\u2019s up with that, do his parents need my chargers or something? He looked embarrassed and told me that I \u201chave to\u201d sleep in this bedroom. \n\nTurns out his parents have no idea he is gay. They know about me but they think we are roommates. He wants me to play along and pretend that I live in the spare bedroom. His parents will sleep in our bed while he will take the couch.\n\nI said no freaking way and he got mad, saying that I have no right to force him to come out. Well god damn I though he has been out for ages! Now after a year of living together he springs on me that his parents think he is straight. I don\u2019t even know if they know that I, the supposed roommate, am gay. Is he gonna ask some female friend to act as his beard too? \n\nWe fought about this, I won\u2019t budge. I moved in with him thinking he\u2019s an openly gay man, I simply will not play this game. His parents are coming over tomorrow and I told him that either he tells them the truth and I stay in the flat as his partner of 2+ years, or he can greet them as a single \u201cstraight\u201d dude with no roommates because I\u2019m packing my shit and going to crash at a friend\u2019s place. \n\nHe calls me the asshole for forcing him to come out, I call him the asshole for disregarding me and my feelings. He tells me that I can\u2019t understand since I come from a \u201ccool hippie San Francisco family\u201d and his folks are \u201csouthern religious hicks\u201d and being gay is not cool with them. Fair enough but he told me repeatedly in the past that he is out! I\u2019ve been lied to.\n\n\nEdit/update:\nSorry for the typos - I wish I had a quest room. \n\nFor now I\u2019m staying with a friend, I won\u2019t go home until his parents are gone. Being closeted is a dealbreaker for me and he knows it, he has known it since the beginning - I would never out him to his family though. We are going to talk once his parents are gone.

    "body": "This happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think I was the dick in this situation, so I thought I would submit myself to judgement.\n\nI was living with and discussing marriage with a girl I'd been dating for around 3 years.  She went off on a school trip around the end of February/beginning of March  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  It was just little things, like she started texting \"luv ya\" instead of \"love you\" and stuff like that.  I finally asked her what the deal was around the end of April, and we ended up \"taking a break\". I moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. \n\nI had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an LG V10 (believe it or not this is important). Around the end of May or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  She gives it to me so I can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  I did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so I decide to give it a shot so I can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  It works, and as soon as I boot it up she starts getting messages from \"David\". Lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. \n\nI pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. She's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our \"break\" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  It's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like \"spending time with family\". \n\nI shoot him a few texts, tell him who I am,  that I just discovered I was being lied to, and that I suspected he was being lied to as well.  Turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the \"other guy\".  Long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female I know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that I should have left well enough alone.  I even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  The way i see it, he deserved the truth and I helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  Clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am I the asshole for exposing it?\n\nEdit to answer some common questions:\n\n>Why did you tell everybody?\n\nI didn't.  I told one person at work, because I thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  That one person told everyone else in the office.  We also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.\n\n>Why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?\n\nWhen I said we discussed marriage, I meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. Plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  I've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\n>What did you do to make her cheat on you?\n\nWell, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't \"new and exciting\" anymore. She met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. Also, fuck you for asking that.",

    "body": "Three years ago, my husband lost his wife of 18 years. She passed from a brain tumor, only 11 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. She was only 41 years old and left behind 4 children ranging from the ages of 5-16. \n\nI have actually known my husband for about 8 years, as we work together. I always found him to be a handsome guy, but never did I start falling for him until a year after his first wife passed. He even introduced me to their kids before we officially started dating. They all accepted me with open arms and have all been nothing short of amazing. \n\nWe got married last November and welcomed our daughter in September. About a month back, we had some family photos done with all 7 of us. They finally arrived in the mail recently and I decided to start framing & hanging them throughout the house. There are 4 photos with my husbands late wife hanging around the house. 3 of them are old family photos and the other is a shot of just her. \n\nThere are only so many places to hang photos in this house, so I decided to move one of the old \u2018family\u2019 photos and place our newly done photo there. The old frame was a lot smaller than the new one I had put it, so I moved the old one to a more tight spot in a less visible area of the house.\n\nI soon came to the realization that this may have come off a bit tacky, so I talked to my husband and children about it upon their arrival from work/school. They all said it was no big deal and encouraged me to leave the newly framed photo in this spot, which I did.\n\nOver the weekend, \u2018her\u2019 parents came over to visit with the kids. They, especially her mother, have always seemed to have a blatant disdain for me. She discouraged my husband from marrying me because I was \u2018too young\u2019 to help raise 4 children . Then, she yelled at me for referring to myself as the kids mother. Despite the tense past, I have never seen her as angry as she was about the changing of pictures. \n\nShe accused me of trying to replace her daughter by giving rid of all evidence that she once lived in the house. I assured her that was not the case. She demanded that I put the original picture back in its place and find another spot to put my photo. I refused, telling her that my husband and her grandchildren had all approved of the way I did things. She then when on a long rant about how I have no respect for her or her husband. I replied by saying that this is my house and I will do things the way I want just as she can arrange the things she wants in her own house. They angrily stormed out of the house and we haven\u2019t heard from them since. \n\nPerhaps I came off a little too hard, but this woman has been making my life miserable from day one. I had simply had enough and felt that I had to put my foot down and stop letting her get away with the \u2018grieving\u2019 excuse.",

    "body": "I was meant to get married on the 1st of February, which was mine and my ex-fiance's anniversary. We ended the engagement shortly after the new year because he cheated on me. The wedding was initially planned with just my money but was very low key, and my parents asked if they could put up some additional money to make the whole thing a bit bigger. By the end about 60% of the wedding was paid for by me and 40% my parent's contribution. My ex and I had agreed that I would pay for the wedding while he covered the honeymoon.\n\nMy ex left me to deal with cancelling the wedding as his money wasn't involved, and I turned to my mother and sister for help because I didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to call vendors and venues and whatever else and cancel everything.\n\nMy sister is engaged, and helped me with a lot of wedding planning. Next thing I know, my mother and sister are asking me if I wouldn't mind my sister just.... taking my wedding. Every part of it, from the venue to the cake, and everything in between. The sole difference will be the wedding dress, and even then she's said if she can't buy off the rack she might have to get mine tailored to fit her instead.\n\nI called off my engagement less than 3 weeks ago. I am a fucking mess. I reached out to my family to help me cancel the wedding, and my sister is planning to take it over instead.\n\nMy sister has rung round our family explaining that she's taking over before she told me this. They are all attending. Her fiance has contacted his family and given them the date he will be getting married. I found all this out TODAY. She asked me if I was okay with this, like she hadn't already arranged everything. I told her to go fuck herself.\n\nI have until the 23rd to cancel things and get the money back. There's a couple of things where I won't get money back at this stage but over 2/3 of it is still refundable. The money will be refunded to the card it was paid by, so both me and my parents will get the correct amounts back. Everything is shut right now but it's the 21st tomorrow. As I've not been in contact with these companies and it's my name on all the contracts, I have full power over this wedding. My sister said she'd pay me back eventually but knowing her I'll never see that money again.\n\nWIBTA if I rung round everything and cancelled?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I talked to my sister and explained how upset I was and how hurt this made me feel and she said that this was a good thing, and it would be therapeutic for me to see good come from bad. I said that is really not what it's feeling like on my end, and to me it feels like I got cheated on a month before my wedding and my sister said she would cancel everything for me and then decided that getting married in my dress in the venue my ex and I picked out together on my anniversary date, and this did not feel good.\n\nI said if she wanted to buy the wedding off me then I needed payment in full for my 60% by the 23rd, and I wanted to switch out our names on the contracts. She said she was hoping for closer to a payment plan, where she paid me back 50% of the 60% I put down in monthly installments over the next TEN MONTHS. She wanted to pay me back 5% PER MONTH for 10 MONTHS. AND I STILL WOULDN'T GET ALL MY MONEY BACK.\n\nI've made calls and cancelled everything. Everything was paid for by me and my parent's money paid primarily for upgrades to the things I'd already bought. The money will be refunded to whoever paid for it, so myself and my parents will all get the correct money back, however, with some, like the caterer, we've lost the deposit entirely, with some, like the venue, they kept part of the money (average 50% but some kept more and some kept less) and with some, like the baker who was a family friend and hadn't started on the cake yet, they completely refunded it. I think the fact that I was open that the wedding was off because he cheated made them feel bad for me and probably made a few of them more lenient on refunds (didn't just bring it up for the sake of it, most of them asked if I'd wanted to reschedule). On the whole, I've gotten a little over half back, which is not as much as I thought. Really annoying thing is that I put these cancellations through on the 21st, and if I'd done it on the 18th (2 full weeks notice) I'd have gotten more, but they waited until the 20th to tell me.\n\nThe dates are now open, the plans are now there, if she wants to rebook everything in her name she is welcome to. She helped me with a fuckton of planning, knows the details better than I do, and she can easily rebook the exact same thing and will probably be doing the vendors a favour considering how close we are to the big day.\n\nSome refunds will be instant, some will take a bit of time (longest is 2 weeks), and I'm no longer going on my honeymoon so once all the refunds have come through I might book a week away somewhere. Not sure what's happening with my sister/mother/family at large.\n\nIn total, I would have gotten more back from my sister than I would from the venues, but it would be a year wait on her repaying me vs a few weeks on the venues.\n\nCurrently drafting a facebook post to tell the family what happened without me looking like a total bitch. I have a feeling they've already guessed what went on but only one way to make sure.",

There is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. \n\nMy son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. The kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. My son was diagnosed with ADHD and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. That said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. Because of that I did not send in a signed permission slip or money. \n\nThe day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. After school I pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. He said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. \n\nHe was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. That is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. Yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? So since it was after school, I messaged his teacher asking about it. I have not gotten a reply.

I'm 25.\n*  I don't know if I'm going to abort, however *if* I do carry the baby full term, I'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.\n*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.\n*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.\n*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.\n*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause. I need to make up my mind sooner than later.\n\n  My mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. I'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. Also to the very colorful PM's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "I (Caucasian F26) married (Filipino M 28) 2018. Everyone in my family is married to someone Caucasian,  literally no-one is in a mixed relationship. About 2 years ago I met my husband and we've been in love ever since. My parents never approved of our relationship and gave me an ultimatum. If I didn't leave him they'd kick me out and never speak to me again.  There was not one reason to hate him bc 1. They've never met him 2. They didn't want to meet him at all and 3. As soon as I mentioned he was Asian they looked visibly upset and my dad turned beet red. And since I didn't leave him, everyone in my family shunned me. For over two years my family didn't talk to me and didn't even know if I was okay. I tried to call them and even visit, but they'd never answer. After a while I got tired of trying. \n\nFast forward 2018, my husband proposed and we agreed on having a small wedding with just close friends and family (80 people approx). I invited my parents, siblings, and close family but no-one showed up. I was so heartbroken because I never got my parents blessing and this is a one in a lifetime event. Towards the end of 2018 I find out I'm pregnant with our first child and we're so excited to be parents. I plan out a small baby shower and I again invite my family and no-one shows up. My mom decides to phone me later that night to tell me that my child will never be accepted into their family and that I'm a disgrace.  At this point I'm fed up with them because they have so much hatred to their own grandson and he's just an innocent baby. A few weeks later I give birth and no-one in my family shows up to see him. But I didn't let them affect my happiness. \n\nFast forward to this year 2020, my son is 6 months old and he doesn't know who his aunts, uncles, cousins, or grandparents are. He doesn't know any family besides my husband's. Two nights ago, my mom called to meet her grandkid but I immediately said no and didn't explain why. I'm afraid they might hurt my child to begin with and they never cared for him until now. \n\nSo AITA?",

    "body": "Me (26f) and my brother (27m) grew up close. As kids do, we eventually grew apart into our teens. My brother wound up dropping out of HS and falling in with a bad crowd. I got a full ride to college. I don't begrudge my brother not going to college. College isn't for everyone, and sometimes education in general is not compatible. It's fine. I loved him dearly, still do.\n\nIt's just that he's 27 and hasn't ever had a job. Any job. Literally any job. He lives in an apartment paid for by our parents in a very expensive part of the city and does nothing but smoke pot and play video games all day. He knows my mom is too afraid of him being homeless to stop supporting him, and my dad just goes along with it. They've refinanced their house several times to support him, which meant they never supported me financially.\n\nRecently, my grandpa died. I was really close to him and the news hit me hard. I would go over once a week at least to clean his house for him (he was 95) go grocery shopping, run errands, hang out, etc. My brother was not welcome in my grandpa's house because he had in the past stolen things. Multiple times he stole valuables from Italy, where my grandpa was born, he stole a TV once, he stole my deceased grandma's jewelry--all to pay for weed.\n\nI was informed by the executor of my grandpa's estate that I inherited one of his houses and a decent amount of money from him. My brother inherited money as well, but far less. Think 100k vs 10k. I feel awful. Yeah my brother can be a shithead but I do love him. I'm sure he has some undiagnosed mental issues. Recently my mom came down HARD, hinting and then flat out informing me that I was to share the \"ridiculous amount of money\" with my brother so that he can get on his feet and my mom could have a break supporting him.\n\nThing is, I don't want to share. I know it's a lot of money and a house, but I don't want to enable my brother to continue his lifestyle. I don't feel like it's my job to worry about what my parents do, because it's their choice, but I don't want to help. My mom is mad, my brother is mad, my dad is mad--so now I wonder if I am an AH for not giving him a little bit more.\n\nSo? WIBTA?\n\nETA: WOW, I didn't expect anything near this kind of feedback. There are so many comments and pieces of good advice and I can't reply to them all but please know I've read and taken to heart every single word, and all of you have strengthened my resolve that I am allowed to say no. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, even the few people who said I was too harsh. I appreciate your insight, every single one of you.\n\nI wanted to clarify something, because a few people wondered what my parents got. It was my mom's dad and they didn't get along very well, but about ten years ago my grandpa gave them their inheritance early. I don't know all of the exact details because I was a teenager and worried about other things lol, but I do know my parents and grandparents (my grandma was alive then) sat down with a lawyer and it was very serious and suddenly my parents had enough money to buy new cars that they needed. I think they also threw money at my high school to make them stop complaining about my brother, but that's just a theory. So yes, they were acknowledged in the will as having asked for and accepted their inheritance early.",

    "body": "Okay so bear with me I do not do Reddit, a friend just suggested I post this here for an outside perspective. I've read the rules and the formatting stuff but I'm also a giant fucking moron so I can make no promises I'll do this right lmao. For context, I'm a 25 year old guy, my girlfriend is a 28 year old woman, my brother is a 16 year old guy. \n\nBasically, my parents are dicks. They've always been more concerned with what the neighbours might think above all else and their relationships to my siblings and I definitely suffered for it. We weren't mistreated per se, but there was definitely tension if we didn't fit their standards exactly. My little brother, who is the youngest,  suffers particularly badly with these. He's kind of goth/punk and our parents don't really approve of his fashion choices, which they fight about a lot. He's also gay, which is a weird point of contention. Our parents are very much \"we have no problem with gays, we just think they should keep it behind closed doors\" kind of homophobes, and they basically refuse to acknowledge or accept that my brother is gay. However, he recently got a boyfriend, which obviously makes that harder for them to do and it's been causing a lot more fights in the house. \n\nAnyway, last night my brother calls me absolutely crying his eyes out. I guess he and dad got into it because a nosy neighbour saw my brother kissing his boyfriend when his bf dropped him off at home and made a shitty comment to our parents. Fight culminated in Dad basically telling him to get out of the house. He asks if he can come stay at mine, and I say of course he can, I'll make up the guest room for him rn. This is where the problem happens; my girlfriend was also spending the night last night. She's mostly great, but she hates children to the point where she refuses to spend an extended period of time with anyone under the age of 20 if it can be avoided. My brother is included in this. She immediately began complaining that I didn't consult her first, and asked if my brother couldn't stay at his boyfriend's place instead, or just apologise to dad and go home. I said no, he's asked to stay here, he's upset and he's my baby brother, so he's coming to stay here. Girlfriend took the huff and basically said if he comes over to stay she's going home. I said 'alright see you then'. She just looked at me all shocked, then stormed out without saying anything. She later sent me a flurry of texts telling me what an inconsiderate, selfish, bad boyfriend I am (as did her flatmate), and is now refusing to speak to me. \n\nDid I do the wrong thing?\n\nEdit: everyone is being so kind to me wtf you guys are lovely. Also my brother informs me this made it to Twitter, so hello lovely Twitter people too lol. \n\nThese comments have given me a lot to think about. Tbh, my girlfriend has been a little bit childish from the get go, but it was never to the point of being an issue. She's the only child of parents who are absolutely \"fuck you\" rich and is a self described \"princess\" who is very used to getting her own way. We've been together five months so far and she's super clever and a really, really good laugh most of the time, plus she's one of the only people I know who is into weird foreign horror films like I am (I know, I know, middle class English white boy into foreign films, don't worry, I am aware that I'm the worst) so I've always kind of put up with her being a bit of brat cause she's fun. However, this whole event (with the help of some of the comments here) has helped me to put a lot of the things she's done and said thus far into perspective. I've come to the recollection that despite being funny and clever and as much of a pretentious hipster shit as I am, she's just not really a very nice person. \n\nI'm going to give her some time to cool off and then try to talk to her. I'm going to explain that my brother is my best friend, he's important to me and she can't expect that to change just because she has some vendetta against kids. I'm also going to try to discuss her general attitude with her, see if there's any kind of underlying problem and what I can do to help if there is. I'm very cognizant of the fact that it's likely to end in a breakup but honestly, at this point, if she isn't willing to change then I don't think I'm missing much. Have a cracking night you lot and thanks again for being sweet.",

I'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. I read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but I didn't really have time since she found the thread. I tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and I think one of her friends clued her in.  I hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their SOs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest I didn't really think she was abusing him. I just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. Molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. Something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. None of this happened sadly. She came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. The vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). I'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. Our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. I know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. Even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe moved back in with her parents, and the silver lining is that she agreed to let me keep the kitty.

Since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.\n\nFast forward to last month and I let my mum know that I would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. I keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. This Sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. \n\n\nLast night they let me know that they can't find anything. They've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...\n\n\nLong story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks I've given them a hard time\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit 1: Thankyou to everyone who had commented, I will include a bit more info below as I've seen a few re-occuring comments.\n\n1. I don't live at home, and I contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until I could get home. \n\n2. When at home I had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. My work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. \n\n3. Im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). \n\n4. My parents have not apologised or spoken to me since Wednesday and my deadline is today. \n\n5.

    "body": "So my daughter was born 2 years ago, I had a very good pregnancy but develop gestational diabetes at 32 weeks (due to me being overweight I was checking my sugar levels every other day). Due to this my OBGYN schedule a cesarean I didn\u2019t have any issues with this I just wanted my baby to be born safely.\nSo before going in to the hospital I talked with my husband that if something where to happened and he needed to choose between myself and our baby to please choose me. He got quiet but said that he agreed and that please let me mother know about what we talked.\n\nEverything went according to plan and both of us where completely fine.\n\nNow fast forward to now trying for number two and in a Christmas party with my girlfriends the topic was brought up about babys. There\u2019s another friend that is also trying so the topic of conversation was on that for a good hour.\n\nWhen my friend ask me that if I was ready for another 9 months of pregnancy and how I felt. I answer truthfully cause honestly I was just letting all the fears and doubts go.\n\nI said that I do want another baby and that pregnancy doesn\u2019t scare me such as giving birth again. I said that I straight told my husband again that I\u2019m scared that something may happened to me during the birth and in the hopes of giving my daughter a sibling I could leave her without a mother. That the original agreement stands that he needs to choose me if that\u2019s the case.\n\nMy friends where disgusted with my thinking and said that i was an asshole to my husband in asking him to basically kill his baby (those where the exact words), that I was a very negative person and that I needed to rethink my thoughts. I\u2019m a person that likes to be prepared for the worse case scenario and hope for the best. I didn\u2019t want my husband to be blindsided with who to choose and to have the answer on the spot. Nobody likes to think in what could go wrong specially in a pregnancy but I need to think every possible case that we could encounter. \n\nSo Reddit AITA!?\n\nEdit: so this blew up, just to clarify some points\n\n1-English is not my first language \n\n2-I say Christmas party but this was at a friends house every year we ( work friends, 8 people) meet to celebrate the end of the year we talk about everything. I have yet to talk to them since this happened I didn\u2019t want to create a scene. It did affect me that they think I\u2019m such a negative person but I will talk with them.\n\n3- yes I\u2019m overweight and I had an almost perfect pregnancy.  People telling me to loose some weight before having another baby, thank you! I didn\u2019t though of that before how enlightening! Also why do people want to know how much I weight? If you don\u2019t know GD can affect any woman that is not overweight yes you have a better chance to have it but not only overweight woman develop it.\n\n4- yes I know this scenario is not a likely one anymore due to the advances in medicine, but giving birth is a serious things, so many things can go wrong in an instant an I wanted to be prepared for it.\n\n5- my thinking was, if something happened to us (me and baby) and my husband had to choose, either way his decision will be judge by my family. \nWhat if I died and he had to tell my parents sorry but I choose  the baby. \nThat\u2019s why he asked me to tell my mom of what we had agree to.\nWhen the conversation was brought up my husband said he thought the same thing, he asked himself what would he do in that case and said that he was feeling awful cause he knew he wanted to save me but didn\u2019t know how to tell me.  \nSo my husband wasn\u2019t force or I made the decision for him. Also we did talked about if I end up in a ventilator or coma or anything like that I left instructions.\n\n6- this is not a pro-life click bait or anything related to that.\n\n7- people don\u2019t like to think about the bad stuff during pregnancy but the risks for the mother are massive, your body goes under so much. It also takes a mental toll on you. \n\n8- also people that are saying that if I\u2019m not prepared to die for my baby I shouldn\u2019t be a mother are TA. \n\n\n9- just some facts for you  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 700 women die in childbirth every year, and over 50,000 more nearly die, experiencing \u201csevere maternal morbidity,\u201d most often due to complications from severe bleeding. \n\nThank you reddit!",

Thanks to all the ex-mormons who told me what I should expect at the funeral, if I hadn't known what was going to happen I would've probably been even more of a mess than I already was. My mom and her family were not happy to see me, she didn't even talk to me during the funeral which I guess is a lot better than her yelling at me. My older brother sat with me and my dad's side of the family during the funeral and was my support through the whole thing. He and my grandparents even encouraged me to get up and share stories about my dad when the time came for people to give final words.\n\nThe wake was nice, I guess my dad would sneak out and get a drink with my uncle every now and then so they had the wake at their favorite bar. My brother supporting me through everything and realizing he would have my back even when it came to our mom means the world to me.\n\nI'm still trying to process his death, especially since he died on his way to see me.

I knew, with absolute certainty, that every single person of importance in my life would hate me if they found out. \n\nWhen I was 16, I entered an online relationship with a boy I met through Tumblr. We never met in real life, but he was one of the first people I spoke to honestly about my sexuality. One day, my little sister (then 13F, now 19F) asked me if she could borrow my computer (I got my computer when I started high school, so she didn't have one of her own yet). I was usually very anal about clearing my internet history, but I didn't think my sister was gonna do much other than poke around Youtube, so I just let her have it. Unfortunately, my email was open, and she noticed that I'd received a notification about a message my bf had sent me on Tumblr. She read it.\n\nShe immediately told me that she had to tell mom and dad \"that their son was a sinner.\" I begged and begged and begged her not to \u2013 literally on my knees, crying \u2013 but she insisted that mom and dad deserved to know, so she went downstairs and told them. Long story short, I spent the next year in a conversion therapy program before finally having a huge blowout with my father and getting kicked out of the house. I haven't spoken to my parents since. I spent almost a year homeless (though I am, luckily, doing much better now).\n\nThree months ago, I got a Facebook message from my little sister. She told me that she's thought a lot about what she did all those years ago, and that she hopes for us to reconnect. At first, I had a lot of difficulty responding to her message, but after some encouragement from a few friends of mine, I finally got back to her. I asked her what she was up to, and what she meant by \"thinking about\" what she'd done.\n\nShe responded by saying that she'd just started her sophomore year of college, and that she was doing really well, but that going to college had given her a new perspective on LGBT issues, which was why she'd finally questioned whether she was right to tell our parents about me. She said she was sorry, and that she hoped I could forgive her.\n\nI don't think I can, though? For one thing, like... she's just now realizing she was wrong? After she literally watched me get abused for a year then kicked out? Plus, I just can't reconcile the fact that she's still close with our parents, who are sending her to a great school and giving her such a wonderful life. It's just not fair.\n\nI told her I don't think we can have a relationship. She responded that she \"hopes I change my mind.\"\n\nMy friends say that I'm being petty, that she was just a child when she outed me, that I should give her the opportunity to make amends, and that I'm taking out my anger at our parents on her. But I think I have a right to set the boundaries that I need.\n\nAITA?",

I was pissed about how rude she was and the way she was just looking at me and expecting me to pay for her mocha frappa-whatever without even asking, so I just shrugged and walked away.

    "body": "Throwaway account \n\nSo, I realize I already sound like a brat. This is the most expensive present I have ever received in my life and I enjoy spin classes, but the back story is what is important here. \n\nAbout a month ago, my significant other said he had spoken with my sister and came up with some ideas for my birthday and would I like to hear them. I obviously said yes and the first thing on the list was a peloton. I have never had any interest in a peloton and as you can see by the spelling in my throwaway username, I can\u2019t even spell it right let alone know anything about it. \n\nI said no thanks it\u2019s way too expensive and I have no interest in it. I work out at work where I spin 2-4 times a week and watch YouTube spin videos. I have an hour lunch break and go to the gym then to make sure I actually get my workouts done. \n\nAfter providing that explanation, I followed up multiple times in the weeks saying \u201cPlease, do not buy me a Peloton,\u201d \u201cIf you ordered a Peloton, please cancel the order and return it.\u201d \n\nToday (the day before my birthday) I walk down into the basement, and there\u2019s the damn Peloton. I\u2019m immediately pissed off. Ask why when I said countless times I didn\u2019t want one, there one is in my basement. My fianc\u00e9 just stared at me blankly. He thought I would change my mind when I saw it. I maintain that I\u2019ve told him ten+ times that I don\u2019t want one and why would he expect me to change my mind. \n\nWe aren\u2019t currently speaking because he\u2019s pissed I\u2019m not happy with the gift. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Wow guys! I can\u2019t believe how this has blown up. I went to bed when there were like 20-40 replies and now I haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to read 90% of replies. I appreciate all the responses. Thank god I used a throwaway and so far no one I know has seen this or at least had the balls to call me out yet.  It took a while, but I finally got my fianc\u00e9 to understand my side of things. He wanted to do something big as my first birthday engaged. He knows I\u2019m frugal and would never ever get this for myself. I believe him when he says he genuinely thought it was a money thing when I said no. He is super apologetic and gets it. We are going to my birthday dinner soon, so all is well. As for the Peloton, it will be returned. I may try it for fun since we have 30 days to send it back. Not sure what I\u2019ll get instead, but at least some puppy training for our dog. Thanks again everyone.",

I really don\u2019t feel as fragile as they think I am, I can do mostly everything I used to do before getting pregnant, just now with some mild discomfort and pain downstairs (I\u2019ve gotten through the worst of it by now). \n\nDue to having a newborn, and with everything going on at the moment, my husband and MIL have been lecturing me if I try to do anything other than stay in bed with our newborn. If we need anything from the store  or have to take care of anything that requires for us to go outside, my husband will be the one to run out and take care of it. I\u2019ve only been out less than a handful of times since giving birth and these were just for occasions that I absolutely had to be there for.\n\nToday my husband and I decided we were tired of eating unfrozen chicken broth, and neither of us had the energy to cook, so he went out to get us some takeout. He came back about an hour later with no food(it shouldve taken him 15 minutes max, as the place he was going to was fast food and like a 3 minute drive from our house). Mind you, he left his phone at home because it was uncharged, so this entire time I had no way to contact him and ask where he was at.\n\nWhen he came back, he told me he had been downstairs at my MIL\u2019s apartment the whole time (she\u2019s our neighbor) mounting her TV and getting a few things done for her. He asked if I still wanted takeout. I was obviously annoyed that he couldn\u2019t at least come back upstairs and let me know he\u2019d be taking care of his moms apartment first, and had me waiting for him thinking I\u2019d get some food by the end of it. \n\nI told him no, I\u2019d go get my own food now and that I\u2019m tired of sitting at home just because he and his mom say I should. As I was leaving he asked if I didn\u2019t feel bad leaving our newborn. I told him that he obviously didn\u2019t so why should I. \n\nThe thing is, I do feel guilty and I don\u2019t know why. I feel like we should both be with our baby right now, even if he thinks remodeling his moms apartment is more important. AITA?",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I have been married for 10 years. For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it \"our\" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.\n\nWe decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.\n\nWhen my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.\n\nEdit: If he had doubled our money or \"won\" in some way, would I be feeling the same way? Partially. I would be angry for him not talking about this with me. This is a large sum, too large not to discuss. I would be happy because I would have more money. Who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? But I would have stepped in and taken control of everything because I see all of this as gambling and that's not what I would like to do with money.",

I work early shifts, so I am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.\r\n\r\nThe mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. I am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations I just suck it up. It\u2019s not like I have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that\u2019s all. The son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but I could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. \r\n\r\nIt was another one of the days when I let the son in and left him be. For a while everything seemed to be fine, until I realized that my cat was missing. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. I then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. Some time later, I found my terrified cat in the FREEZER.\r\n\r\nI confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? He swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. I then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly the mother was furious about how I treated her son. I told her that I did it for the safety of my cat because I found her precious kid trying to kill her. She argued that I could have locked up my cat instead, in which I replied that I had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. She threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son. \r\n\r\nI shared this with my friends and while some said I should have rejected them a long time ago, others said I went too far. What do you think?\n\n\nEdit: I need to point out that the agreement to \"look after\" the kid was that I only needed to allow him inside and play video games and he stays till his mother returns. I am no \"babysitter\" and I made it clear to the mother, in which she agreed to it and still asked for my help.\n\n\nFor those who wondered, kid wasn't locked up for \"hours\", maybe 30min~ or so, I don't really remember, was busy checking on my petrified cat.

My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  \n\nPretty much since my son was born I\u2019ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I\u2019ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I\u2019m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I\u2019ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  \n\nMy girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we\u2019ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn\u2019t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. \n\nWe are a great team usually.  It\u2019s almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She\u2019s fighting dirty too, she\u2019s been making it out as if I don\u2019t really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That\u2019s not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn\u2019t even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she\u2019d never admit it. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there\u2019s just a big \u201cNO\u201d feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. \n\nI also feel like it\u2019s really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don\u2019t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. \n\nNeither of us have been backing down and it won\u2019t be too much longer until it\u2019s time to give him the money.

Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.\n\nMy aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.\n\nThis was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.\n\nI loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.\n\nNow, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.\n\nShe eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.\n\nOnce we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was \"making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day.\" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.\n\nI'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified.

And it took almost that full time to let it sink in what I\u2019ve really done. I self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. What a mistake that was. She called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. She told me that she was thrilled we\u2019re not together and that I\u2019m manipulative and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d That left me really shocked and I had to review my behavior over the time we had been together.

I guess I thought it was a sign of being a strong person. Like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. It sounds stupid because it is. I reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. Even the language I used showed that she was right and I am manipulative. She\u2019s a human being and I didn\u2019t treat her with respect. I played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. I deserve what happened. I also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. She had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because I really was so enamored. So I probably looked insane going on about having three children. It sounds so stupid to me now. Among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. I wasn\u2019t asking her to be forgiven, but I wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. And as most dumped people tend to do, I couldn\u2019t even give a shit about what I was bitching about in the first place. I miss going to the park with her and her son. Those days were nice and calm and I didn\u2019t appreciate them. I let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good.

    "body": "Hello redditors\n\nMe and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a \"milestone\" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.\n\nSo I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.\n\nSo she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..\n\nEdit: To clarify: the sports car is the only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.\n\nContext update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car which is pissing her off.\n\nEdit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.\n\n1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).\n2. She only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping \"heavy things\".\n3. We've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.\n4. Yes, I did \"warn\" her that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.\n5. I do no treat my wife as a child.\n6. We have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. We also own things together of course.\n7. The reason I sold my \"other\" car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.\n8. A lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo\n9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) \"go out and buy her a car and get over with it\". I saved up for many many years for the car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.\n10. A lot of people asking regarding the \"driver who picks her up\" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into \"our own\" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. \n11. Both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved. \n\nAITA for this?",

Now for those of you who\u2019ve never paid for a music lesson, I paid my music teacher $40 an hour (who I\u2019ll admit is a significantly better musician than I). \n\nSo I said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019d babysit your kid for minimum wage but definitely not a music lesson.\u201d\n\nAnyways, she gets really upset but doesn\u2019t say anything to me directly and complains to my parents. They go on to me about how she didn\u2019t know any better and I shouldn\u2019t be a prick to their friend and how I wasn\u2019t a damn pro at the cello that I shouldn\u2019t expect a ton of money since I\u2019m not that reputable. Like I know I\u2019m an amateur and all, but she drove to our house in a fucking Tesla. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, I didn\u2019t expect so many responses. Decided I\u2019d go ahead and call the lady and apologize for being impolite. It went well, my mom recommended a really good *violin* teacher (apparently she also didn\u2019t know the difference between a violin and a cello lmao). As soon as the quarantine ends her son will start lessons with the lady my mom recommended.",

    "body": "[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)\n\nSo my sister's wedding was today. I took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and I are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. She stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn't welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn't allowed after \"what he'd done to her\", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. I just calmly kept telling her that if she didn't want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. \n\nI guess she thought I wasn't being serious, because I got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where I was. I told her I wasn't coming. I got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew I was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. I ignored them all, though I did text mum and apologise for causing problems but I *did* inform my sister I wouldn't be going. Culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. They got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. Apparently I've ruined her wedding day, but I'm really struggling to care. Maybe that makes me now the asshole, I can accept that. \n\nJust thought I would share this update, since I posted about it here initially.\n\nETA: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.\n\nFirst the whole \"she got rejected by my boyfriend\" thing. This one is my fault, I thought I'd included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! Essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don't blame her he's hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y'all got triggered) and was told no. She's held a grudge ever since - I think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he'd said he wasn't interested i her. He was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. \n\nSecond, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. This is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. I'll clear up that we've *never* has a good relationship, and she's been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since I was very small. She's also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. This is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it's caused.",

She says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants.

    "body": "A bit of backstory, my husband\u2019s brother (we\u2019ll call him Tony) is the youngest in their sibling trio. Tony is 29 and got married about 3 years ago. When Tony married his wife, before my now husband and I met, my husband (Larry) did a little \u201cprank\u201d on Tony\u2019s wedding night. Larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote \u201cjust married\u201d on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. Larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. I\u2019ve seen pictures of this myself, if I can find them, I will attach them in an edit. \n\nFlash forward to my husband and I\u2019s wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed Tony did a \u201cprank\u201d of his own. He covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. He also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. \n\nMy husband and I were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. Tony didn\u2019t see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. We drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. \n\nWhile we were cleaning, I called Tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset Larry and I and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. I also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn\u2019t going to be cheap, to which Tony said, \u201cuse the money I gave you guys for your wedding present for that then.\u201d Which angered me more and I hung up on him. I did not cuss at him nor did I yell. \n\nAfter we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, I got a very nasty call from Tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn\u2019t take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. I didn\u2019t say anything back, I just hung up. \n\nThe next day, I wake up to texts from his family saying that I was too harsh on Tony, that Tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just \u201cgetting Larry back\u201d for what happened at his wedding. Larry told me that he actually deleted texts that Tony sent me over night because he was \u201cembarrassed by what his brother said.\u201d \n\nI refuse to talk to Tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. I apologized to Tony for perhaps being too harsh, which I admit, wasn\u2019t a genuine apology. But, I expected an apology back. Instead I got more \u201cpoor me\u201d from Tony. Larry &amp;amp; Tony\u2019s parents texted me saying I need to \u201cstop creating drama\u201d and step back and think about how this makes Tony feel. But, I think my ignoring Tony is valid as what he said before was very hurtful. \n\nI\u2019ve been called an asshole by Tony himself. And i\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something here that I\u2019m missing\n\nAITA?\n\n\n**UPDATE: Brother-in-law posted to Facebook with a totally false story**\n\n[and here\u2019s what he posted](https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qGLj8) \n\nSo, I thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on Facebook but it\u2019s just this one. That only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. Brother-in-law posted that \u201cI [Tony] welcomed OP to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!\u201d\n\nYeah, *I\u2019m sorry, what?* I did **not** cuss him out nor did I insult him as my young daughter was around. He also added, \u201cOP should get over herself as it wasn\u2019t even that bad.\u201d Yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. Only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. Everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that I cussed out *poor Tony*. \n\nI asked Larry what the deleted messages said and Larry told me the gist of it was, \u201cOP and her daughter will never really be apart of this family.\u201d And Larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this seems rude but I am very upset as Tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. Larry said that he\u2019s going to take care of it from here and that if I get involved more, Tony is just going to make more lies up. \n\nAnyway, I appreciate everyone\u2019s replies! A lot were very helpful, Larry and I are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. I\u2019m still refusing to speak to Tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. Hopefully things work out soon! I don\u2019t want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. Thanks again!\n\nEdit: You can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. It might not be high-res, sorry. There is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m sorry, I did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, I should\u2019ve. I was still pretty fuming from everything else though, I didnt really think of it. I\u2019m going to ask Larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",

    "body": "To clarify some things, my husband and I are both bisexual. No one can usually tell that about me, but on the otherhand my husband is very feminine, \"flamboyant\" and basically the stereotypical gay man. He also speaks with the so-called \"gay voice\". Almost everyone assumes that he is gay when they first meet him, unless I'm there to introduce myself as his wife. \nWhat I'm trying to say here is that yes, it's very easy to perceive my husband as gay and not bisexual, and that is not the reason why I snapped.\n\nMy husband has this straight female coworker, let's call her Sarah (obviously fake name). The first time I met Sarah was at a party, where all of this went down. My husband had never met up with her outside of work, and the few times he had mentioned her was mostly him complaining about her being too clingy and overbearing at work. He described her acting in a way which, to me, sounded a lot like she had a crush on him. \n\nDuring the party, me and a few other people started chatting. Sarah was one of those people. The LGBT topic came up (can't remember how) and I mentioned that I was bisexual. To that, Sarah says \"oh, I have a gay bff, his name is [insert my husband's name]!\" \nI asked if it was [husband's name] from [husband's workplace], and she said yes.\nI told her that clearly he didn't consider her to be his bff, as otherwise she would've known that he is bisexual and married to a woman. She looked taken aback and asked me for proof about him being 1) bisexual and 2) married. I just pointed at my wedding ring. A few of the people with us (mostly me and my husband's mutual friends) burst out laughing, and Sarah looked extremely humiliated.\n\nWell, after that went down my husband never complained about Sarah being too clingy/overbearing again, so I guess something positive came out of it. What made me snap was that I knew that this was the woman who had been making my husband's work days more stressful by being so clinged to him. But my intention was never to humiliate her in front of other people, and that makes me feel like I might be TA.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Some of you have asked why hasn't my husband told her that he's married. My husband isn't even friends with Sarah, they're just coworkers. According to my husband, they've never had any kind of meaningful conversation together where something like that might come up. I don't think that it's odd, as I have never mentioned to any of my colleagues that I'm married unless the topic specifically came up or if I tell a story which includes my husband. \n\nMy husband works in an industry where it's not possible to use any jewellery on hands, so all rings, bracelets etc. are banned during work.",

I went to the bathroom and when I came out of the stall Abby was standing there waiting for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll cut a giant argument short, but Abby accused me of breaking up with Tom to get with Steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was \"super weird\" that I was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that I'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that I should have left the group when Tom and I broke up. My response to this was to tell Abby to 'know' her place and that I had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be \"gotten rid of\" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and Steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbby went out and told Steve I attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. Since then, I've gotten messages from Abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, I am and that Steve and I were fucking the whole time. One girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' I am. My own brother says he feels that I've caused this drama myself by\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra info as required:\n\nHoly shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. And I did not expect gold at all - so thanks? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I did mean 27 in the post - I failed to mention that Abby is actually 22; but I do highly accept that I could have handled the situation much better; I am NOT a confrontational person. I grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which I hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. I think being ambushed is why I lost my cool. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read a lot of comments about how this came off as \"not like other girls\". I don't know how to not make it do so. I'm simply not \"good\" at being friends with other girls. I'm shy, awkward, I stumble over my words; and because I \\*want\\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. I do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoundaries - I'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if I'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. Again - childhood abuse. Once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomebody mentioned that I'm obviously into my friends if I got with Tom. Tom and I kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. We all thought it was going to be forever - but Tom got some bad health news and put \"us\" on hold until/unless it ends positively. He doesn't want to put me through that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe long version of the argument began with Abby asking why I was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); I stared at her in shock and said \"what the fuck - what's going on?\" and then she straight away started with the accusations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a last note - the previous girlfriend of Steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, I stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. It was about 2 weeks before Tom of all people got it out of me and he went to Steve and told him. I offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words I said were, and they all said \"No, she's in the wrong\" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand I was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. This was repeated to me this morning when I showed the messages I was getting from Abby and her friends. I was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - I know) and was told by Steve \"well she obviously wasn't wife material then\". being friends with these guys for so long and that I should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. He also feels that I'm leading on any man I'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if I have or am sleeping with. So - AITA?",

    "body": "I am a 35 years old guy, and I was lucky enough to marry my crush (27F) two years ago. We met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. Anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.\n\nWhen I married my wife, I was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren\u2019t mine, but I love my wife so much I am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes I think I\u2019d be happier going back to my \u201clone wolf\u201d life. But I fully know that this is my life now and I try my best to suck it up and do what I signed up for.\n\nBack to the story: I know the kids dad had died only from my wife\u2019s words and I\u2019ve never had reason to doubt that.\n\nIt has been two or three months since she started convincing me that I should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). I\u2019d be fine with that, it\u2019s just paper for what I would do anyways.\n\nI agreed to that and she said she\u2019d get on with the documents. Well fantastic! I thought. I like not having to do anything. What really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. She started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she\u2019s with me.\n\nI thought she was cheating so I did what every scumbag like me would do, I spied on her. Long story short, I come to know by a very reliable source that\u2026. her ex-husband isn\u2019t paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. The world crushed on me. First I thought the guy was dead, now I discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife\u2019s bank account while I was financially providing too.\n\nI confronted my wife and she didn\u2019t deny any of it. She started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids\u2019 well being. She was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (I have no proof of that). She also said that it was a while since she felt I should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. She was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. She said that her ex is \"dead\" for her by all means. She admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. That's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.\n\nNow, I need to find out more about her ex-husband that\u2019s for sure. I am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. Meanwhile, will I be an asshole if I refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he\u2019s ALIVE!) and if I state that I will retract from them all the financial support in case I decide to get a divorce?\n\nEdit: it's child support not alimony, sorry english is not my first language.",

He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. \n\nAt the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. \n\nHe calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.\n\nMonday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.\n\nNoon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. \n\nWhile waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:\n\nManager: \"Are you going to leave a tip?\"\n\nBrother: \"No.\"\n\nManager: \"Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip\"\n\nBrother: \"You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip\".\n\nManager: \"It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity\". \n\nBrother: \"That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip\".\n\nManager: \"Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas\". \n\nAt this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).\n\nMy brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker. \n\nIs my brother the asshole?",

My wife has a significant inheritance and we both earn generous wages, and it was her idea to open college savings accounts for Michael and his brother when they were babies. This is likely to be the only family money for college they'll receive.\n\nAnyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his Switch the whole time and Michael was on his phone. I didn't think anything of it until the following Tuesday, when I found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an Instagram post made by Michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we BOTH follow him (as do his grandparents). \n\nHe posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. My wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.\n\nI'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. My wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen.

I need some honest feedback to help me go forward. \n\nI'm a huge WWE fan and I pretty much get all the PPV. Money in the Bank, there was a ton I wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that I really wanted to see. It was may 19th and I made it very clear I wanted to watch the event. On May 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and I had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). I assumed the wedding woukd be on Saturday so I agreed. Well Saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed I wasn't getting ready that I was like oh shit, I can't go because of rhe PPV. She got so mad at me so I relented and went. \n\nIt was one of those events where there I didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. So after he sort of blew me off when I tried to congratulate him I was like fuck this and I got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the PPV. My wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally I got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. \n\nThings honest to god haven't been the same since. She says I looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. My mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that I must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. \n\nTo me I had plans, I did my part to attend and when I didn't know anyone I made the best of a bad situation to do what I wanted anyways.\n\nWas I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: \n\nto address the common repeats:\n\n1. No I don't do network, my wife would come unglued if I have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. I still do PPV even though its more expensive. \n\n2. Invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just \"forgot\" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when \"we\" hadn't RSVP'd. That's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. \n\n3. Yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. But since we got a late invite and I don't speak with my mom all that often I would have no way of knowing in advance. The bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. I'd never met any of them. \n\nAny thing else I can clear up without having to answer over and over?",

Posting on an alt in the hope that people here can give me an honest answer. \n\nMy husband of 10 years had an affair that lasted approximately 6 months. He cut it off when I found out, we went to couple\u2019s counseling, etc. Turns out the woman was pregnant though and intent on keeping the baby. I understood that if she gave birth, my husband would have to do his part in supporting that child (at the very least, financially).  \n\nTragically though, the baby was stillborn. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to this baby coming but I didn\u2019t wish for this either. My husband\u2019s former mistress has sent details about the funeral. I don\u2019t think he should attend. He never got to meet this child and wasn\u2019t even there at the hospital when everything happened. If this was a child he knew at all, of course my opinion would be different.

This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn\u2019t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We\u2019re both here to respond to comments if you have any.\n\nI saw that a few people asked what my aunt\u2019s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. \n\nI also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn\u2019t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven\u2019t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I\u2019ve done I would hope she would tell me.\n\nAnother question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.\n\nAfter reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin\u2019s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. \n\nAfter the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would \u201csabotage the wedding\u201d if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.\n\nThe wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other\u2019s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven\u2019t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I\u2019m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.\n\nThanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! We got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). If you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",

    "body": "My father was never present in my life even after various attempts I made to have a real relationship with him. The little time I spent with him as child he was very abusive (it took me longer than most to lose my baby fat and he'd always make snark comments about it; he'd also compare me to evey other child he knew and I'd always not be as good as them). \n\nWhen I was ten my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. Things got really tough, we had to move in with my grandma who became responsible for the both of us. Money was always tight (mental ilness treatment is very expeny in my country). My grandma tried to contact my father to ask for  help with me because it was really tough for me to see my mother in the state she was in. He always said he couldn't take me in or help with extra money because he had a new family that need his attention. After a while he moved to the other side of the country and didn't talk to me for years. \n\nEventually things got better, the meds started to work and now you couldn't even tell my mother has any kind of mental ilness. However, money was still short for us, especially after my mom got pregnant again even after the doctors said that was impossible (abortion is not a option in my country). \n\nAfter I finished HS I had no hopes of ever going to college because we couldn't afford, but my mom still made me take my country's equivalent of the SAT. Somehow I got a 50% scholarship for one of the best schools in the country. The problema was, even with the scholarship, we still couldn't afford and I couldn't work to pay for it because the school was in the next town and I'd spend literally every time off in traffic (we also don't have college dorms here).\n\nAt this point my dad was back in town, so I decided to give it a try and contacted him to see if he could help. He wasn't rich, but he had money and was alwaysdoings stuff with his family so I figured he would have at least a little to help me. \n\nBut all he said was: \"can't help you,,you know that. Just find a job\". And after that he never tried to contact me again.\n\nRight after that my mom received a very high restitution form the state and literally gave it all to me. I went to college, graduated, got a amazing job and now I paying for my sister's college.\n\nLast month my mom made a FB post saying how much she was grateful to have me as her daughter because I was helping with my sister education and then out of the blue my dad decided to contact me and ask for me to help with his other daughter college too. I said I couldn't because I was already paying for my sister's and I was saving to buy a apartment. I also said that maybe she should get a job. I felt really great, but then them he started to say I was being a vindictive a-hole. He made a FB post about it and now a lot of people are agreeing with him to the point where I'm reconsidering it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nWow, this really blew up. I decided to make this edit because it would take me forever to respond every individual message. \n\nFirst, I want to thank you for how nice all were. Also, really thank you for whoever sent the wards, you didn't need, this is just a troaway account. \n\nSecond, I decided I wont be making a FB post to respond to him. A lot of you said I should post my side of the sorry, but tbh I don't think people will care. The ones that are on his side knows he was never present and knows my mom was sick, they just think I should help because we're \"family\" and nothing will really change their mind. \n\nThirdly, I decided to help his kids. I know I have no obligation to them, I know that maybe he's lying about his money problems, but it's just hard for me to see a person I'm technically related to in a situation I struggled so much with. But I won't be given them money per say. A very good friend of mine works teaching for a college in my city, it's far from the best school, but they offer a lot of scholarships and they are cheaper than most. He said he could get up to 25%. As I said, it's really not the best school, but it's still better than nothing if you're in need. They could try getting a loan for the other 75% or something.",

But damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said \"Whose kid?\"\n\nMe, now pissed: Mine\nHer: what do you mean he's yours?\nMe: I mean he's mine\nHer: he can't be yours\nMe: ever heard of IVF?\nHer: So you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend\nMe: Wife\nHer: And when were you going to tell me about all this?\nMe: I don't know, I don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store\n\nI walked away and checked out, her following, still talking shit.\n\nI put my son and food in the car and left. My mom called later. I tried to talk to her. I apologized for the secrecy, said she gets condescending when we talk about these things. She denied this. She then went on about how I didn't invite her to the wedding, that she'll never get that moment back and see me get married(which I do feel bad about).\n\nShe eventually asked when I would bring my son over. I said never. I said I wasn't going to bring him there when she's so negative toward us. I said she doesn't respect me or my family so she doesn't deserve to know my family. Hung up on her and haven't answered her calls or texts. She has apologized for speaking to me the way she has but I don't care at this point. I'm too fucking mad. AITA for not inviting her to the wedding and not allowing her to see my son? Is \"never\" too harsh?",

    "body": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aoadwq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_dance_to_a/\n\nTwo months ago, I married the love of my life. I was thinking about this thread the other day, how it went, and where my head was at when I made it, and I thought you guys might like an update.\n\nA little anticlimactically, the thing I was stressing about was a bit of a miscommunication, which probably happens a lot here. Kayla wanted to dance with her late fiance's (I'll go ahead and just call him Luke from now on) father at our wedding, and Vanilla Twilight was an example of a song along the lines of what she wanted, not the set-in-stone top choice like I had thought. I (and a lot of commenters in the original thread) spent a lot of time over-analyzing the lyrics to that song looking for hidden meaning in every word, while it turns out she hadn't put much more thought into the suggestion than \"This is a kind of sad song that I like.\"\n\nWe got together that night and she had made several playlists of possible first dance songs for us, songs for when she walks down the aisle, music to play at the reception, and song choices for her dance with Luke's father. We spent hours listening to them all and talking about the wedding. We even made a tournament-style bracket for our first dance song in her journal and put songs head to head against each other until the victor emerged. And at the end, we talked about the wedding and our relationship, Luke and their relationship, and grief, what it was like when she lost him and what it was like for me when I lost my mom at a young age, what a family is, and all the things we're hopeful for for the future. We stayed up until three in the morning just talking and planning and laughing and crying a little, and I'm so glad for it. After getting bombarded by dozens of different opinions from dozens of different people earlier that day, I had been worried that I was going to have a conflict with my fiancee shortly before our wedding. But there was no conflict, just a pure memory.\n\nAfter that night, I starting putting in more effort to be involved with the wedding planning process and actually ask for the things I wanted, which Kayla actually really appreciated. We also took a long weekend a couple of weeks before the wedding to go on a camping trip together for just the two of us, which I highly recommend to anyone who is getting married. Overall, there was a complete flip in my feelings leading up to the wedding from being somewhat insecure and excited but nervous to being completely at ease, excited, and feeling stronger about my relationship than ever.\n\nThe wedding day itself was really wonderful and worth the wait. Kayla and Luke's father had their dance to Lean On Me, and I also had a dance with Kayla's mom and it was very emotional in a good way. I really felt that the day was a celebration of our love, and I was genuinely happy that Luke's parents were there to celebrate along with us because they are very much members of our family and I wish I had the space to describe all the ways they've been there for us through the years.\n\nMy amazing wife is who she is because of all the experiences that she has had in her life, and I don't want to be the kind of man who asks her to pretend that she has never loved before me or pretend that her grief is something that is or should be done with forever now that she has me. I just want to say how glad I am that we shared that night together and that the wedding was nothing but love and celebration. I never thought I could be so happy.",

    "body": "I have 2 kids, different dads. I have a savings account for both. The account of my oldest, Lucy, has had \u00a310 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over \u00a313,000. The second account is for my son, Luke, who is 6. I have regularly added to this account since I found out I was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.\n\nHis father, my fiance, had a separate account for Luke and has told me he was doing the \u00a310 a week since we started the accounts. I recently found out the account he has for Luke only has a couple hundred in it. My fiance earns less than me but more than my Ex. If my Ex can afford \u00a310 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my Ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the \u00a310 payments each week (I earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by Ex). My fiance said he \"forgot\" and asked me to redistribute the contents of Lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from Luke's. I said fuck no.\n\nLuke's account is around 3k less than it should be. We have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. We don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.\n\nMy fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k Luke is missing all at once. I have said that I want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account I control that is meant for Luke. I would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested I take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my Ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. I also said that I want him to set up a direct deposit of \u00a310 to the account that only I control each week. I will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor people asking why this is so urgent to me: It's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in Luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when Lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when Luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. While I don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what Lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nI asked him again why he didn't have the money. He said he just didn't. I asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). He refused. I told him that if we were combining finances in any way I should be able to see where his money is going. He responded that I wasn't showing him my financial information, so I pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. He then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. We had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. He has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.\n\nI cannot see us getting married after this. Not ever. It's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",

They are kids. They are loud. Not screaming loud. They love playing in the yard and playing at the park literally across the street. My next door neighbors complain all the time about the noise level in the yard and at the park. They are this boomer retired couple with kids my age (mid-30's). Actually most of the neighborhood is like that because so few people especially with kids can afford a house in that area so it's a bunch of retired boomer snitches with Ring and security cameras at their front porch (no, NOTHING ever happens here) and they designated my neighbor as the block cop. The funny thing is that the kids are hardly home. They're in school most of the day and have sporting practices/games on the weekend.\n\nI tried to reason with them, but they feel that because they lived in their house for 40 years that we have to follow their rules as their next door neighbors and keep quiet. I have no sympathy for them. These are the people who bought their sizable home for $40,000 in the 80s and if adjusted for inflation, it's like buying the same house for $125K. But it's a house in LA so it's more like a million. My wife and I make good money, but our mortgage is astronomical. We are working much harder than our neighbors ever did.\n\nYesterday, our neighbor came to our door and asked complained, again, about our kids being loud. Not too loud. Just loud. At the park. Per the other neighbors who lived across the street from said park. Then he lectured me about my \"logic\" of moving to a quiet area with loud kids. If that wasn't bad enough, he suggested that my wife and I look at homes by the ocean because \"you don't have neighbors to the west of you.\" Houses by the ocean are like millions of dollars lol. I asked him how I would do that and he said that wasn't his problem. So I told him that he should move out of their house and move to the ocean where he won't have neighbors.

I still gave it to him for cheap because growing up I was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. Keep in mind I sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. I promptly told him I can\u2019t do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and I agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people I don\u2019t even no.

Said there aren\u2019t any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why I said what I said. I\u2019ll update with his response.\n\nUpdate #2: He did give an apology of sorts. Said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. I told him I appreciate that but I currently stay busy enough without it and that I wouldn\u2019t mind giving him 50% off only bc we\u2019re boys but this would be the last time. He said he didn\u2019t mean for it to come across the way it did. Idk I still feel like it isn\u2019t resolved, we\u2019re going out for beers this weekend. Going to get him to understand my side of things.\n\nFinal update: He sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. Apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a PayPal payment for 5 flags at full price. Glad it all worked out, I\u2019m going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. Thank you all for the advice. \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

My cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on Facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). In this post, she went on and on about how Child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. She listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.\n\nI don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. I would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why I have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.\n\nI replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'So great to see another [surname] starting their next stage in life, just after [brother] and I graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false.

I have nothing nice to say. I am not flattered, I feel violated. I feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither I or their father have, though this isn\u2019t about tattoos in general-it\u2019s about tattoos of my kids\u2019 names. To each their own on tattoos). More importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. She barely knows them, and doesn\u2019t spend time with them when we do visit. On our last visit, she sent our kids to McDonalds with her friend and didn\u2019t join them. She later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she HAD been there. It\u2019s crazy. Instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge BTW), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? She talks about my children taking care of her when she\u2019s in a nursing home... why would they? They will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!\n\nI was so mad when I saw the tattoo that I told my husband I wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). I have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but I feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy. AITA because I think tattooing my kids\u2019 names on her body is weird? Am I supposed to feel flattered? I feel like if anyone is going to tattoo my kids\u2019 names on their body is should be me or my husband!",

    "body": "Today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.",

I am here on a partner visa.\n\nI am currently 3 months pregnant and I thought we were both happy. However, I only just found out that he's been having an affair with a coworker for the last 6 months. At first he denied it but I had proof so he changed to begging me for forgiveness and that we could work it out and all this bullshit. But I don't want to. I'm done. I don't want to be with a cheater. I broke up with him and already moved into an Airbnb. I'm planning on going back to Italy because I have nothing here apart from my pos ex. I let him know today. He flipped out and told me I can't do that. He said I'd be kidnapping our child and that I'm not allowed to leave. But I've made up my mind. I already talked to my parents and I can live with them until I have figured everything out. I'll likely get my old high paying job back so I'm not worried. \n\nHowever, all of my ex's friends have been texting and calling me all day saying I'm a pos for stealing his baby and that they will take legal action. I don't think they can and I wouldn't be allowed to stay anyway since I'm on a partner visa and this partnership doesn't exist anymore. \n\nAITA for going home?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nUnfortunately the mods wouldn't let me post an update post but I'm hoping that some of you still find this if you are interested.\n\nMany of you wanted an update so here it goes. \n\nI left Australia the day after my first post and I'm in Italy now. I'm staying with my family. Thanks to the good connections my friends have I got a good job at the very company I worked for before I moved to Japan. \n\nAt first I thought I'd keep the baby but after a lot of thinking I decided I would abort it. It had to happen rather quickly as I was running out of time so I had the abortion today in Switzerland. I'm doing okay. This morning I sent a text to my ex letting him know about the procedure and when I checked my phone after it was done it was full of missed calls, texts dripping with abuse and threats that he would come to Italy to stop me. So yeah I made the right decision. Nothing ties me to this man anymore. I feel weirdly free but numb at the same time. But I'm determined to start over. \n\nLastly, I would like to thank everyone who sent me encouraging messages or even offered their help. I do really appreciate this so much. I hope you understand that I didn't message you back but I was so busy getting out. I will forever remember the internet strangers who were willing to help me out. \nTo the people who called me a whore and said the world would be better off if I got hit by a bus, I forgive you.",

I'm not a white guy who says \"I have lots of black friends\" because I don't, but Rob and I have been thick as thieves since we went to Jr nationals for wrestling. I literally love the guy like a brother.\n\nWe are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. Since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. We both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. So far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. Whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and Rob and I are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.\n\nSo the group had this dinner on Wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. I have no idea what Robs deal was but I looked across the table and Rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. I about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and I had no idea what he was doing and I've eaten meals with him thousands of times and I've never seen him do such a thing. It was hysterically funny.\n\nSo I looked at him and I said \"hey Rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?\"  Rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. We say stuff like this to each other all the time. \n\nBut the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous \"clutch the pearls\" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. I may as well have shot Rob in the face. I was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to Rob to make sure he was \"OK.\"  I knew I fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and Rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. I thought it was over and done with.\n\nWell yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the \"horrors of racism\" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said \"u/Monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at Friday's meeting.\" Not apologizing to Rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) I said to my best friend ok the planet.\n\nAgain, Rob and I got a big laugh but I'm really pissed she said I WOULD be apologizing when I hadn't even been consulted yet. I think I should just quit and leave her hanging. Rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but I don't even want to do that. \n\nNot necessarily looking for advice because I have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am I the asshole or not?\n\n\nEdit: well group meeting came and went. They didn't want to allow Rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, Rob's a pretty chill dude but I think that really bothered him. We didn't make a huge scene like I guess we could of, we both basically said \"no thank you\" and we'll take our services elsewhere. Rob says hello...",

    "body": "So I was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  We had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. I told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. \n\nThe table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. We sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. \n\nAnyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn\u2019t mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. \n\nAt first I was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say \u2018yes\u2019 because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. But my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn\u2019t been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. So I said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. I know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should I bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.\n\nThe waitress looked at me as if I had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. I\u2019m so sorry for the inconvenience\u2019  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). \n\nAfter this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn\u2019t top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).\n\nAfterwards my friend told me that I should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn\u2019t have been so un-accommodating. But the way I see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. If they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.\n\nAm I the asshole for pushing back on the waitress\u2019 request and refusing to share our table?\n\nTLDR\nWe had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. Half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. I politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. This was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.\n\nEDIT: spelling ",

My daughters really love this since it makes them feel closer to their mum\u2019s heritage and they get to travel a LOT in the meantime. My in laws are very well off and will spend parts of the summer taking the girls skiing or exploring exotic locales all across Europe and even Asia.\n\nNow my wife is feeling very annoyed at how her kids are feeling as a result.

The constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens IN OUR HOUSE, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an outlandish rule.

I just wanna know if I\u2019m an asshole for it. \n\nMy 15 year old son came to my husband and I last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. As someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. They\u2019ve been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. Regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under CONSTANT supervision, so this was all a shock. We know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. \n\nTurns out we were wrong. When we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she\u2019s been pregnant for SEVEN months. On top of this, they\u2019ve only known for about a month or two meaning she\u2019s had basically no prenatal care. \n\nWe were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so I called my older brother. Not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, I told him I\u2019d individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. When I called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s even his.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing this, I immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. She\u2019s apparently a serial cheater, even though I didn\u2019t even think that was a factor in a 15yo\u2019s relationship. I\u2019ve never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that I didn\u2019t know about, knowing he\u2019s never trusted me enough \n\nAfter this I contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as I could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. They FLIPPED, they were pissed about what I was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. While I might agree, this is my child\u2019s life that\u2019s gonna be deeply impacted too. \n\nSo my husband and I decided we\u2019re gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. AITA for demanding this? Am I being unreasonable? As bad of a parent as I feel like I am right now for letting this happen, I feel I\u2019m no where near as bad as the girls parents...\n\nEDIT: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he\u2019s on board and understands why a paternity test is important.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: We have DEFINITELY discussed safe sex with our son, as I said I was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they\u2019re educated. I in no way blame the girl, I just want to protect my son.",

I walked in to find half eaten Dominoes pizza on the counter (remember I sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so \"dedicated\" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. \n\nI walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. Fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. I stood there in shock. She saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. He turned around and hit me with the oh so classic \"this isn't what it looks like!\" \n\nI was speechless and had no idea what to do but I saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. Because apparently I'm a petty b!tch, the only thing I could think was I wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. I don't know, it made sense at the time. \n\nHe came after me begging me not to overreact, I didn't say a word and took off to my car. In the days since he's gone from begging me to \"be reasonable,\" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.\n\nThe thing is, I love these jeans. Yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. But they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and I like wearing them. \n\nSo EX has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him \"real problems.\" I don't give a slight shit about his problems but I sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. \n\nSo I'm asking...I know I'm petty...but am I an asshole?\n\nEdit: the plot thickens, I just woke up to following text:\n\n\"hi, Alyssa. This is the weirdest text I've ever written. I'm Madison and I was the girl in Aiden's room last week. I'm so, so, so sorry, I don't know how to say it other than that. The look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Please believe me when I say I didn't know he had a girlfriend. I would have never been there had I known. You have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in December and I'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which I how came to be in Aiden's room. The pants you have are the ones I bought the day before my dad died, he gave me \"permission\" to go treat myself and it's the last time I ever heard him call me by his pet name as in \"pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans.\" It would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. I know you've been hurt and I feel for you and I think Aiden is pure scum, all I want from him is getting my pants back. Please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. Thank you so much, Madison.\"\n\nSo I guess I have to give them back...I'm in tears here.\n\nEdit 2: just woke Aiden up at 5:45 (on Org Chem test day too...fuck him) with \"what's Madison's last name?\" He tried to give me the \"who's Madison?\" at first but then told him she texted me. He tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. So I looked her up on Facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a \"instamodel\" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has IV and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so I'm thinking the text is not a lie.\n\nEdit3: I just texted back and forth with her, we\u2019re meeting at Starbucks at 9.\n\n\nEdit4: (Wednesday evening\u2014had tried to do a new post but mods suggested I just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. Hope it makes sense I\u2019m just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) So wow, that first post got a ton of heat and I'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and I appreciated the laughs. I don't know what the overall verdict was but I'm ok to think I was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.\n\nSo like many of you saw, the girl (Madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if I would give them back. We texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the Starbucks by campus so I could return them. I got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which I thought was very sweet (I'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one I liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which I also thought was very cool. I wasn't sure whether or not I even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. I handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. Lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because I could tell she was really upset by it. I did my best to comfort her which I hope was well received.\n\nSo as we got past that the only things I wanted to know were: how long had she known Aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. She said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last Tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. She said after I showed up Tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. She said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since Sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.\n\nLots more happened and I can expand more in the comments but I think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that I gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. When he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...\"thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles.\" Yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.\nLike I said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so I can say more if anyone is interested. Thank you for being so invested in my life. I've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",

    "body": "I (25F) am half black, half Canadian aboriginal. I am light skinned with 3A type hair. I look pretty black, hardly aboriginal. I spent my entire life defending myself to both the black community and the aboriginal community. I have to admit, I have always identified more with my black roots than aboriginal ones but since I now have a son whose father is full aboriginal, it\u2019s very important to me to embrace *both* cultures. This is relevant. \n\nRecently, we went to a local store in our small Canadian town that sells handmade mukluks by the aboriginal community. We wanted to get some for all three of us. It was just my son and I in the store - my husband was not with us. I go up to the register and the cashier doesn\u2019t greet me or even acknowledge me. She starts ringing up the mukluks, chucks the boxes in a bag and says \u201cpayment?\u201d With a dirty look. I pull out my debit card and say \u201cdebit please\u201d. She then mumbles under her breath \u201canother one trying to steal our culture\u201d. So I said \u201csorry, what?\u201d And she says \u201cyeah, you heard me. You\u2019re just like the rest of them, coming here to steal what isn\u2019t yours\u201d. \n\nI immediately got upset because I AM aboriginal and I\u2019m not stealing anything. This is just as much my culture as it is hers. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I pulled out my treaty card from my wallet, put it on the desk, and said \u201cI want to speak to your manager please\u201d. She turned bright red and called another woman over. I explained what happened and said I wasn\u2019t looking for anything except for comments like that to not be repeated. As I said before, I spent my entire life defending myself to BOTH communities i am supposed to be apart of. I also don\u2019t feel like I need to justify why I\u2019m buying mukluks. The manager basically said she would deal with it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to the cashier, if she got in trouble or not. But on the drive home I felt really embarrassed and now I feel like I\u2019m TA and should\u2019ve just ignored her and moved on with my day. So AITA for speaking to her manager and *potentially* getting her in trouble?\n\nEdit: thank you for Silver, kind stranger! \n\nI\u2019d like to add some details for those who are confused - \u201caboriginal\u201d isn\u2019t only a term used in Australia. It\u2019s commonly used to refer to native people in Canada. Within the last few years the terminology has shifted from aboriginal to First Nations, or indigenous people. But aboriginal isn\u2019t suddenly wrong to say. \n\nAnother note: my father is Blackfoot and my mother is Dominican.",

I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\nEDIT: Seems like theres a lot of confusion about my wifes faith and her relationship with her family.. Heres a story that might clear things up.\n\nMy wife and myself were at the beach. Having fun, trying to surf. She was wearing a very sexy two piece bikini. She takes selfies of herself, and posts them online where she thinks her family cant see. Harmless fun.\n\nHer brother somehow sees, and rudely tells her that shes disgracing her family. Not even kidding. I tell him to lay off her, and he threatens to attack me. Her brother is 17.\n\nThe father not only knew about this, but liked the brothers posts. Needless to say my wife ended up in tears and we haven't gone to the beach since. These are her family.\n\nEDIT 2: Post locked which is fine. Theres obviously been enough.\n\nTo all those pming saying that im a racist troll and that the mods \"exposed\" me, i messaged them and they have no evidence. That is just one mods (incorrect) opinion that they decided to sticky for whatever reason. I told them that it was causing confusion and sending harassment my way, they dont seem to care.\n\nThey also muted me for even asking so theres that.\n\nIt is simply their opinion, which is fine to have. It is nothing more than that.\n\nAs an update i realize i was over the line to lay down an ultimatum but i dont know what to do or where to go from here. Im stuck. Thats about it.",

    "body": "Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. \n\nFor flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. \n\nDuring the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.\n\nOn the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. \n\nMy husband and I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. He finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. He said Amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. \n\nAs someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber.",

    "body": "I am 19M, and my sister (22F) got married about a week ago. She was rather mean to me growing up, and I still don't like her very much.\n\nSeveral months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me.\n\nWhen I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now. She went and discussed it with her fianc\u00e9, only to be told that she can't do that. So I immediately left the wedding and muted my sister, her fianc\u00e9, and my parents on my phone. There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead.\n\nWhen I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month. My sister is now demanding that I reimburse her $2500 for the organ rental, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I told her to pound sand because not only was there no contract, she didn't even uphold her end of our verbal agreement.",

It stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. Since then I've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally I've had more luck with girls. I still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.\n\nAnyway, me and a few friends I've made since last year went out to a gathering. I'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! Clara was there. I think she recognized me but I wasn't sure. Me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned.

So, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and I sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute.

He asked me if I was any kind of serious drinker and I said I was not. \n\nIn hindsight I should\u2019ve made sure his idea of serious drinker and mine were the same thing, but hindsight is 20/20. \n\nThe whole conversation was \u201cHey I\u2019m sorry if this is a little personal but I have to ask, do you drink?\u201d And I said yah, and he said \u201cSerious drinking, or just the occasional kind of thing?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, not serious at all.\u201d Thinking he\u2019d probably had a bad experience dealing with a hard partying ex roommate. \n\nSo we move in and I start stocking up my liquor cabinet and he says \u201cWoah, what\u2019s all this\u201d and I tell him I have a few bottle of liquor, but not to worry, I haven\u2019t been drunk since college (still figuring dealing with drunk guys was his concern.) \n\nHe didn\u2019t seem thrilled but didn\u2019t bring it up again. \n\nI usually have a glass of wine with dinner. The first night I did he said \u201cCongratulations. What\u2019re we celebrating?\u201d And I said \u201cNothing, just unwinding.\u201d He seemed uncomfortable and I noticed we never overlapped during dinner again, but at the time didn\u2019t think much of it at all. Never occurred to me it was intentional. \n\nFast forward to today. He said \u201cI don\u2019t tell many people this but I have a drinking problem, I haven\u2019t touched a drink in 6 years, but every day is still an active choice to do so, and I\u2019m sorry but I cannot take being in the house with your liquor cabinet and wine drinking every day. Could you move some of this stuff out of the apartment like to a friend\u2019s place or I\u2019ll pay for storage.\u201d \n\nI told him I\u2019d have to think about it. I was leaning towards saying I can keep the liquor in my room as a middle ground. I want to be supportive and everything. But I\u2019m not a heavy drinker at all. I really like unwinding at the end of the day. And I feel like if he needed this accommodation he should\u2019ve said something at the outset. Now we share a house. \n\nBut I also get for him it\u2019s a medical condition he\u2019s fighting and for me it\u2019s just a recreational preference.

    "body": "I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.\n\nThe thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.\n\nMy family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:\n\n1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.\n2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"ignorance is bliss\" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.\n\nBut is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.\n\nEdit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.\n\nEdit3: I will write letters to them.\n\nEdit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.\n\nEdit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.\n\nAnd YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).\n\nEdit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.\n\nEDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.\n\nSo many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.\n\nPS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.",

It was unexpected. I gave birth without an epidural because I couldn't get one with the timing, it was the hardest most painful thing I could imagine.\n\nI didn't get hardly any time with our baby at all before the doctors and nurses had to take her away and I was just laying in bed feeling awful, in pain, feeling like \"did I do something to make this happen?\" I had some risk factors like stress and a past struggle with disordered eating that's left me at a low weight.\n\nThen suddenly my husband's mother came in, asking where the baby was, asking a lot of medical questions like how premature, had I been resting enough during pregnancy, how was the baby... That really hurt when I'd been questioning myself so much also.\n\nAnd my husband was just talking her through it all even though I had told him nobody but us in the hospital. \n\nI spoke up and said I wanted to be alone with my husband to rest, and he actually said that it'd just be a few minutes, they'd step out to the lounge. I didn't feel any better, I didn't want to be alone and I didn't want her possibly pushing back into the room.\n\nNow onto the questionable part...\n\nI should explain I grew up in a pretty abusive traumatic environment and that's given me the defense mechanism of just running when I am feeling scared or overwhelmed. It's something I'd thought I'd gotten past with therapy but I guess that moment I was feeling worse than I had in a very long time. \n\nI got up, kinda zoning out the pain because I felt so anxious. I got covered up with my long winter parka and pulled on my boots, and grabbed my purse and made a (slow) break for the parking garage. \n\nI got to my car and by the time I was there the pain had really set in, I felt dizzy and was scared of passing out if I drove, so I just laid across the backseat.\n\nI lost track of time before a nurse found me, and at that point they brought me back inside and put me in a private area for treatment. \n\nIt's been a month since then now and it's caused so much trouble.\n\nI'm upset my husband didn't keep it to just us.\n\nHe says that he didn't know how serious I meant it; plus with the premature labor it was like all our plans for how my birth would go were out the window. His mother was just concerned.\n\nHe's also really bothered I left, he said it's serious destructive and I wasn't thinking about my own health or safety.\n\nHis mom has said that I seem too instable to be a mother.\n\nAITA for walking out?",

    "body": "I (17f) have been struggling with some depression after my dad passed. I spend about a year isolated, never leaving my room, just laying in bed all day miserable. I started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment I come home I will still crawl right into bed. I just have no energy. \n\nMy 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if I wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. I told her several times that no, I don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. Especially with that many people around. \n\nBut when I came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (Maybe 10% family I'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). I didn't know what to do so I walked back out again, I grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when I came back they would be gone. \n\nWhile at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that I was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. \n\nI came home about two hours after I left the party, my mom was super pissed. I tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. \n\n\nWas I the asshole? My mom is still not speaking to me, and I do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.\n\n\n\nEdit: my mom and dad divorced a few years back if that matters. And I do have friends that my mom knows, but none of them were invited.\n\n\nEdit 2: \n\nI'm already in therapy and its helping.\n\n This wasn't meant as a validation post, your parent and family telling you you're wrong will make you doubt yourself. \n\nAnd I was dead on my feet, I had just worked 9 hours and I just wanted to sleep. I'm an introvert so social interactions already cost a lot of energy, so I couldn't have just 'faked in for an hour'\n\nPretending to be fine when you're not takes a lot of energy, and I couldn't at that point.\n\n\n\nEdit 3: after receiving several messages about \"using your dead daddy for attention seeking\" and the like, I'm going to log off for a while. Thank you everyone for commenting :)",

    "body": "So I wrote a kids story a while ago and have kind of been sitting on it. Recently I showed it to a fellow writing friends and she encouraged me to send it to an editor who said he could help me publish it. I was excited of course cause this has been a dream of mine.\n\nI was telling my family about this and my niece begged me to let her draw the art for my book. I love my niece I really do and I want to encourage her as much as possible. She loves to draw and doodle, but here is the thing.  her art is mostly copied off the internet, or very crudely drawn people. She has talent and I know given time and practice she will be an amazing artist. As of now though it's not anywhere I need it to be.\n\nI tried to explain to her, that for this project I have to go with someone more skilled. She was not happy. Sadly my niece has never been told no by my brother or his wife. they also think I should let her do it. My brother told me \"it would be a bonding moment.\" My sister in law said \"it would mean so much to her to help.\"\n\nThe art I need has a lot of action. Needs to have someone who can draw out whole scene not just a person here or a oddly misshapen dog there. she would have to make her art original and do more then just copy it.\n\nAITA for telling her no?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: So I had a long talk with my niece after school. me and her went for a drive, got Ice cream and went to our favorite place to sit and hang out away from her parents.\n\nI told her I did not mean to make it sound like I though her work was bad. (Someone please write a walk through for the clueless adults with no kids) I told her that with this kind of career you're kind of locked in to whatever the people who buys the rights to your book decide.\n\nI also showed her a few of the post by people who worked in the Biz. who talked about the hard work it takes to make a kids book come to life. thank you whereegosdare and VeryVeryTexan for that info. she was kind of shocked that is was not a simple straight forward draw a picture and submit it. She is still very interested in becoming an artist but thinks an illustrator is not her cup of tea.\n\nHer mother and father are avoiding me right now, cause I blew up after they started in again about how I'm \"killing their little girls dreams.\" Honestly My brother is worse then my SIL, but you can only strangle a sibling so many times before your parents think you might actually be trying to kill them.\n\nI also took a lot of peoples advice to heart and started to look for an agent rather than self publish. Figured I would let all this kind of stuff be their issue. I just want to write stories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : many of you have asked and yes the guy I was talking to wanted to charge me. Almost 6 grand for editing and illustrating. he then offered to cut me a deal 3 grand off his price. but he wanted half up front. He also said he would not be able to help me with publishing, I pretty much ran away screaming. so thank you guys for the advice on that. I have started looking for an agent now. \n\nThank you everyone for the advice and letting me know that I was NTA, also for helping me see I hurt my niece. Today her father started acting \"cute\" about this situation and trying to rib my niece in to playing the tears again. She shut him down and told him that She did not want to be an illustrator cause and I quote \"I'm not putting up with all that!\" \n\nthey are still avoiding me or keeping my two nieces as buffers between us. It's my house so you can bet they can't \"hide\" for long. ",

    "body": "ETA: Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your comments. I'm too overwhelmed to respond, I'm too overwhelmed in general right now. I am seriously grateful to everyone who shared thoughts, from YTA to NAH to everything in between. These kids are awesome and I'm truly privileged to be their stepdad. Hope my wife and I can work this out. \n\nAlso, tip for any parents in a blended family: I loved my stepdad BECAUSE my mom was the parent. My mom never made my stepdad do things a parent should be doing.  He never had to enforce behaviors or chores. My Mom was ON IT. She was still basically a single parent and he was the support guy. So if your SO seems resentful or distant or too harsh around your kids... check yourself first. Be the parent. Then, the stepparent won't overstep. \n\nMy (37M) beautiful wife (39F) and I have been married awhile now and she has three great kids, 12, 9 and 7. The kids are awesome. Coolest people I know.\n\nMy dad died when I was 9 and my stepdad came around 3 years later. The best thing my stepdad did was take the pressure off my mom so she could be there for us. I idolized my dad but I loved my stepdad too and being one has made me proud \u2013 I actually get a kick out of taking over the laundry so my wife can play with her kids, or fixing their bikes so they can go ride with her. I do more than 50% of the house & yard work. Happy to.\n\nHowever, the only thing my wife and I ever fight about is the fact that she won't make her kids do ANY chores. Like none. They don't clear their plates, they don't sweep or vacuum, they often don't even flush. It makes me furious with her. Even when my dad DIED, my mom kept our chore chart going. She said we all had to help each other. It gave me consistency, responsibility, pride and character.\n\nThen, all this happened. Like all of you probably, I'm overwhelmed. Now, there's three times more housework because everyone is constantly home. I can't do that much housework plus work from home and I've been raging and angry all the time.\n\nMy wife works part-time from home and gets child support from the kids' dad, who does make them do chores at his house. She has refused any and all attempts to have a conversation about how we might teach the kids to clean up and do their fair share of the housework. Guys, I am not asking them to scrub the floor with a toothbrush! I think while they're home all day, they should be learning how to do simple stuff, like help with dishes or help with laundry or sweep the floors or flush the toilets in addition to playing. They have 1-hour of school a day. They can do 30 minutes of chores and still have 10 hours to play and enjoy themselves. Everybody should do a fair share.\n\nBecause my wife refuses to even discuss this with me, I chose a different tactic.\n\nI'm not doing any more chores until the kids do.\n\nI'm not going to rage around being resentful, angry and exhausted all the time. Those kids are amazing - I'm not going to wreck the great relationship I built with them either. It's their mom's fault they're like this, not theirs or mine. I'll work and do basic cleaning up after myself. That's it. My wife can do everything else, or she can get everybody on board doing their fair share.\n\nSo, what do you think? My wife thinks I'm TA not supporting her when she needs it most. I think she's TA for babying her kids and overloading me. What do you think? AITA?",

    "body": "So I was trying to finish some of my chores and I heard some screaming in my sons room. I ran into the room seeing my daughter trashing and breaking my sons room because she did not like how my son is not allowing her to use and break his things. I saw that and was mad because this was not the only time my daughter did that and it was the 6th time. I was done with her behavior and I told her I am tired of her not respecting other people's property in the house which was a rule set in kindergarten. \n\nI told her that I am kicking her and she has a month to pack her stuff and find a place. She asked why can't I kick out my older son and not her. I told her that my older son never broke or screamed like a five year old and that he pays rent, helps with bills and follows the rules we set for him. She was threw a fit of rage and left and pack her stuff and went to a friends house. Her friends mom came in and asked me to reconsider my stance and allow her back in and I refused.\n\nEdit- thank you for those who gave me your opinions.  I am going to let my daughter back in the house in a couple of conditions. The first one is that she has to apologize to my son. The second one is that my daughter has to go to therapy. The third condition is she has to pay for a new speaker and help pay for repairs of the phone that was broken which my son has. The final condition is that she is not allowed to ruin property and if she has an issue with my son she has to bring it up with me. If she breaks any of the rules she will have a month to pack her belongings and get out. There are no second chances.",

    "body": "I'm getting married this weekend and am looking forward to it so much. My soon to be wife is amazing and her family is just as awesome. My family on the other hand, well, lets just say I'm the black sheep of this family because I'm not an entitled person or arrogant SOB.\n\nSo, I have a lot of family coming into town from up north (we live in Texas and extended family lives mainly in the upper midwest). I didn't even want to invite the majority of them in the first place because I don't know who they are and don't have much of a relationship with them. A few weeks ago my mom said that she and one of the cousins talked about having a post wedding sandwich dinner at my mom and dads since A) we aren't having dinner at the wedding and B) this will be the first time a lot of this extended family has gotten together down in Texas. So my mom said \"Your dads cousin and I are thinking of this after your wedding, around 5:30 and then going to your brothers hockey game at 6:15\" Me-\"Ok, have fun\" \"You're not going to come?\" \"No, wife and I are going to order pizza and enjoy our first night as man and wife\" \"Oh, ok\". And I thought that was that\n\nTwo weeks later, same thing. Mom \"It would mean a lot if you and your wife would come have dinner at the house with everyone\" Me- \"I've already told you we have plans\" \"I know, but it would mean so much to the family that you never get to see\" \"We. Have. Plans.\" \"Ok, sorry for trying to do something nice\". Meanwhile, I'm filling in my soon to be wife on this and she's like \"Is your family crazy? That's our wedding night and we get to spend it the way WE WANT TO\" I tell her I know but this is what's happening and it probably won't be dropped.\n\nThen, last night, I'm watching the Stars v. Blues game with my mom, youngest brother and his gf when my mom says \"Your other brother is texting you, please answer him because he's bugging me now.\" my other brother (who I care for but don't have the greatest relationship with) texts me \"Hey, what's this I hear that you aren't coming to dinner after the wedding?\" \"It's exactly as it sounds\" \"Why not?\" \"We have plans\" \"To do what?\" \"Husband and wife plans\" He sends back a puking emoji. I text the future Mrs. saying \"WE ARE NOT GOING TO MY MOMS SATURDAY\" She can't believe they are still trying to get us to go and doesn't understand why they won't take no for an answer.\n\nI asked my grandma about this who said \"It's your wedding. Don't tell anyone what your doing or where your going afterwards. You spend the night with your wife. You're entitled to that\"\n\nSo, reddit, almighty R-Slash, anyone who reads this, am I the asshole for not wanting to go to my moms the night of my wedding?\n\nEdit: for those asking, we are having a cake and punch reception. Just no dinner.",

    "body": "Update 2:\n\nHi, me again, a final update for this asshole situation. I texted back and forth with the neighbor to try to resolve this amongst ourselves and quickly realized it was fruitless because I was, indeed, dealing with an asshole. Apparently they did not like the way I treated them when we worked together in a restaurant \u2014 I always took my job seriously and hospitality is now my career as where for them it was just a \u201csummer job\u201d.\n\nI wrote the landlord a letter detailing the worst of what I\u2019ve dealt with \u2014 included that neighbor has personal vendetta \u2014 and sent it electronically and in the mail. He responded after an hour or so saying that he talked to the neighbor and explained the situation and that everything should be ok now and they understand. If not, he said we will all have to have a meeting. Landlord then apologized for any inconvenience. I feel fully vindicated and hopeful the landlord realizes what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s no fool! Happy with the outcome and ready to NOT be the asshole to MYSELF in the future!  \n\nSorry that wasn\u2019t more exciting guys!!!! \n\n__________________________________________________________\nUpdate: \n\nAbout 30 minutes after I posted this, I got a call from my landlord (who has never had to call me in the 3 years I\u2019ve lived here) saying that he got a complaint from the neighbors that I was blasting music last night at 2AM. I immediately told the landlord that I got a call from neighbor asking to turn the television down and I did. Then I proceeded to tell the landlord all of the fuckery I\u2019ve been dealing with since this guy moved in. I sent him text receipts confirming that he was having a party, and video receipts from a separate party I recorded the night they partied until 4AM when I had a flight at 7AM. He said he will take care of it. \n\nI then sent the neighbor a text message asking why they called the landlord when we had an agreement to text each other if someone was being too loud and how ridiculous it was for them to even ask that due to their partying. And how absolutely nuts it was for them to call the landlord after I turned my TV off and moved to a different room for them. This resulted in the neighbor revealing they have a personal problem with me stemming from 5 years ago. I did not mention that since we live in a close knit downtown area, everybody knows everybody. I asked neighbor to get together to talk face to face about this problem and he informed me that he couldn\u2019t talk right now, because he was getting ready for work.... at noon.... after asking me to turn my television down because he had to \u201cwork early\u201d. Neighbor wants to get together next week to discuss their issue when it\u2019s better for their schedule. Fucking please. \n\nThanks reddit, there is some AMAZING and some HILARIOUS advice/stories in this thread. You guys rock and I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate all of these suggestions for my first time dealing with a neighbor like this.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________\nOriginal: \n\n\nMy household is very quiet, I live a sober life and if I ever have a party it\u2019s a small dinner party that is over by 10PM. I have a dog who rarely barks but can be loud if she runs which is a couple times per day. I work a shift job that is mostly evenings but can sometimes call for an early morning shift. \n\nI recently got a new downstairs neighbor. I was sad to see my old neighbor go because we rarely had problems. My new neighbor STOMPS around at all hours of the night. As soon as my neighbor moved in, they started having people over and throwing parties. The first party I gave them a free pass \u2014 perhaps a housewarming? But the parties and people over have just continued and gotten worse. The loudest and latest party they\u2019ve had so far was blasting music, banging and screaming until 4:30AM when I had a 7AM flight. This culminated in them having a party the other night. I could hear every single person in their unit screaming while sitting on my couch watching Netflix at 1AM.\n\nI got up to go to the kitchen and my dog ran after me. My neighbor, who was having yet another party, banged on their ceiling with a broomstick because my dog ran through the hall... while they were having a loud party. The next day I confronted them about that and made the mistake of saying \u201cif I\u2019m being too loud, just text me\u201d\n\nWell... last night I just about hit my boiling point. I\u2019m watching a movie in my living room at 1AM - a regular activity for the past 3 years I\u2019m living here. My neighbor calls me on my cellphone and asks me to turn my TV down because they have to work in the morning. I was honestly flabbergasted that this person who throws loud parties multiple times per week was asking me to respect their right to quiet. I turned the TV off and went and watched it in my room. \n\nGuys, WIBTA if I confront my neighbor today and tell them that they can\u2019t have it both ways? That if they want right to quiet, they can\u2019t be having parties? We can\u2019t live a life where we constantly have to communicate about work schedules or be texting each other to be quiet. I feel fully confident in saying that they\u2019re the problem because my old neighbor and I got along swimmingly despite having opposite work schedules. HOW can someone who throws parties and stomps around vibrating the building late at night ask their neighbor to turn their television down? I\u2019m floored!",

    "body": "My in-laws live in a sleepy artsy fartsy town where nothing ever happens. They know all their neighbors, half of the family lives near by. They're the kind of people who are comfortable with anyone coming in or dropping by unannounced just to say hi, show someone something on their phone, etc. It's very Full House.\n\nSo that being said, they don't lock their door. We've piled into the car to go to the store or other places before and I've said \"Do you have the key?\" to be (gently, not meanly) laughed at and had it explained that they don't need to lock the door. \n\nI'm not comfortable with that, but I didn't say anything. I just moved my travel bag into my car. When we went to get ready for bed, I passed by the door and saw it hadn't been locked. I asked if I should lock up for the night and the family chuckled again. I felt extremely uncomfortable, so for peace of mind, I locked up. \n\nIn the AM, FIL got up and went to get his paper. He found the door was locked and said \"(My Name), did you lock the door?\"\n\nI said yeah, very casually. He looked at me like I was crazy. I said I'm just not comfortable with leaving doors unlocked. Both of them laughed, and for the rest of the weekend, the jokes continued. Things like \"Who hurt you?\" and \"What was so bad in your childhood that you can't deal with an unlocked door?\" and \"What do you think was going to happen, someone was going to break in? This isn't (Big City we live in).\"\n\nWe ended up leaving early because my husband was tired of telling them to knock it off. A few days later, my MIL posted what was supposed to be a funny thing  on FB and tagged me, saying \"(My Name) and Husband visited, but DIL isn't cut out for that (town) life! She couldn't handle a few unlocked doors and thinks the whole world is out to get her!\" cue the family making fun of me, my upbringing, etc.\n\nI'd finally had enough and posted back: Home invasions happen. My best friend's dad was murdered in their home by an intruder when I was 12 years old. Forgive me for caring about my safety and infringing on whatever makes you feel superior here.\"\n\nShe deleted the post and told me I was out of line, it wasn't my place to lock doors in someone's house that wasn't mine, if I didn't feel safe with them, maybe I shouldn't visit anymore. I said sure, Husband and I won't visit anymore. She backpedaled and made it clear she meant just me, but I asked why he would drive all the way out there (it's about 5 hours) without me just to be with people who were mean and judgmental about his wife and a locked fucking door? This turned into another big \"you're taking my baby away from me!\" situation.\n\nAnyway in relaying the whole story to others, I've had a surprising reaction. Am I the asshole for locking a door at night?",

    "body": "I graduated college 4 years ago and I rarely speak to my mother or father. Maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it\u2019s only for a few minutes, they refused to let me play sports in high school or have a social life and they\u2019ve basically cut me out of their lives since I and about 75 other people got a city drinking ticket 7 years ago in college. Since I live about 800 miles away, I only go back to my hometown once a year either for Thanksgiving or Christmas, most years I stay with a friend or at a hotel, last year I stayed with my parents. No way in hell am I going back for either this year.\n\nJust about 5 months before I graduated college, my parents bought a boat. I know they got a good deal on it and they have used it a lot. They took it out of the water for the season in early October. I\u2019ve literally never seen it in person, just pictures from Facebook.\n\nLast week I had texted my father (first contact since March) and let him know I would be able to make it back for Christmas. About a minute later he called and over the course of 5 minutes explained how he and my mother decided since their last child was about through college, they would buy a boat. The only problem was they didn\u2019t have the ~$20,000 to buy it.\n\nWhat was their solution? Take out a student loan in my name of course! My mailing address was always their house through college so I was none the wiser. Why was my dad telling me about it now 4 years after the fact? Because they can\u2019t pay it back, they actually never paid any of it back. They kept putting it in forbearance but that ran out early this year. Fast forward 7 or 8 missed payments later and my dad tells me the only reason he\u2019s telling me now is because he doesn\u2019t want me to bring it up at Christmas and he knows it\u2019s going to default in a month or two. His exact words were \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a big deal about this it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t come home this year\u201d.\n\nHe also said it\u2019s \u201cabout $25,000\u201d is what I would need to pay it off. I hung up and just sat in shock for a couple of minutes. I called my brother yesterday and told him what was happening and that I think I\u2019m going to sue them for whatever it takes to pay off the loan. I still don\u2019t know what that amount is yet, I should probably find out by next week. I\u2019m cool with my brother and he\u2019s cool with my parents and I\u2019m sure he probably talked to them because this morning I get a text from my mom just saying \u201cDo NOT sue us\u201d. I texted her back saying she would need to immediately pay off the entire loan and show me proof. She texts back that I need to grow up. Obviously I\u2019m not even going to respond to that.\n\nThe boat is probably worth half of what they paid for it by now and with the hours they\u2019ve put on it. I don\u2019t know if they have the money or not to pay up immediately if I sue them but I figure I can at least garnish their wages. My other brother called and asked me to hold off a few months before doing anything that it was shitty of them to do that but to give them a chance to start paying if off.\n",

Elaines trash makes my trash so full that the bin can not close. She sometimes puts her garbage bags next to my bin also. The city will pick this up, but the HOA does not like to see trash bags or open trash cans in front of the house. They will fine you. \n\nCost for trash pickup in my city is around $300 a year (25/mo) and it costs around $45 dollars to get a bin if you don\u2019t already have one. \n\nThe first time I saw her doing this, I confronted her. She said that she was waiting for her bin, and she didn\u2019t want her trash to pile up. I said, fine you can put your trash here *for now* but make sure that the can closes. If not you need to hold it. \n\nA month passes by and Elaine is still using my trash can. I asked her what was going on and she claimed that she could not afford to get a bin right now, and apologized. At this point I have received two notices about my trash cans overflowing. I told her she could no longer put trash in my can. \n\nLast week, I was off from work. I saw Elaine, again, putting an enormous amount of trash into my trash cans. When she left, I took her trash out of my cans and placed the bags into her porch. \n\nIt turns out that Elaine went out of town. So the trash sat for about a week in front of her door. It was disgusting. I wasn\u2019t home when she returned, but my wife was. My wife says that she came to our house throwing a fit about the garbage. She said she had several notices from HOA and had been fined, and asked why we put disgusting trash in front of her door. She got into a very heated argument with my wife. \n\nMy wife called me up and told me about what happened. She thinks I\u2019m an asshole for the way I handled this situation because now we are not on friendly terms with our neighbor. I just don\u2019t think being on \u201cfriendly terms\u201d means that we should be taken advantage of.  She needs to pay for her trash to he collected like everyone else. Was this an asshole move?",

    "body": "Sounds bad. But let me explain. \n\nI am not from the US. I live in a conservative country. Although abortion is not strictly illegal, its all hush hush. To the point, where unless you are vouched by someone, the doctor will deny that he/she performs abortion, even if you ask them. It because if someone finds that a particular doctor does this, they might start getting threats. \n\nMy sister was 2 days past her due date when I found out that I was pregnant. She is 10 years older than me. I am still in college. Me and boyfriend decided it's best to abort. So, one of my friend's father is a doctor. So I asked her to ask him to get me an appointment with some good doctor in the city. I was 7 weeks pregnant by then. \n\nOne week passed. My friend was in the process of getting me an appointment when my sister went into labour and gave a still birth. All of us were very devastated. I was the child's godmother of sorts. I was also feeling absolutely crushed. We planned to have a funeral a week later. \n\n3 days before the funeral, my friend came though for me. I was 8 and half weeks pregnant by then. She got me an appointment for the next day. I spoke to doctor over the phone and when I asked her I could postpone it, she advised me not to wait. \n\nAs this was a trying time for my family, I decided not to tell anyone except my mother. I told her in secret and explicitly told her not to tell anyone. I just wanted to let her know because I usually tell her about all the medical stuff that I do. My boyfriend was going to give me a ride to the hospital. \n\nThat day I was in a lot of pain and I came home and rested. Next day, I was bleeding a little, but nothing unbearable. I wanted to go to my sister's house to help with the funeral arrangements. \n\nI went to her house and learn that somehow she found out about my abortion. She took me to her room and yelled at me about how insensitive and childish and selfish I am. She also yelled a lot of things about how I didn't deserve that child and if I loved her at all, I would have spoken or asked her permission before I did this. She also yelled about how she could have changed my mind and adopted the child, if only I would have talked to her. I felt pretty shitty already and I didn't argue or say anything to her. After she finished yelling at me, she forbid me from coming to the funeral next day. \n\nThis was a about a month ago but that's the last the last we both spoke. Neither of us attempted to talk to the other one after this. \n\nMy mom thinks that it's my fault and I should apologize to her. My boyfriend thinks that I have nothing to apologise for. I honestly have no clue what to do or what to apologize for. \n\nI understand that what she did was because of the pain she was in. She was pro choice and I know she didn't mean what she told me. But she however denied me the chance to say goodbye to my godchild. I don't think she should apologize for what she yelled at me, but I think she should atleast apologize for banning me from the funeral. \n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole?",

So, naturally, I talked to my SO the day after I posted this on the subreddit. She recently joined this subreddit so she'll probably recognise this post (if you see this, I love you very much <3). \n\nI expressed my concerns for the break up and how it would affect our vacation together, specifically the room arrangements and told her of my conversation with my friend. She basically said what you guys did: We have no obligation to rearrange our trip for their comfort if they're going to break up, so I shouldnt feel obligated to give up our room together for that. They, especially my friend, has the responsibility to work out something. We agreed that it's a weird situation overall, but with her support I felt even more confident.\n\nWell, my friend and his gf broke up as expected a few weeks after I made the post. I casually confronted my friend some time afterwards. Like, \"oh by the way when we talked about you wanting to change the room arrangements. We're not really up for that, so if you can find another option then that'd be swell.\" More or less. He took it well and said he understood of course, but his gf ultimately wouldn't be joining us even though all of us said she was welcome to do so and that she could find another room or hotel but it was her choice. We all agreed that it was his responsibility to find another person to join us if he didn't want to pay that much. He took responsibility for it which I really appreciated, but in the end he had to pay the full price. She still had to pay for the plane ticket and the activities we were supposed to go on, but she said it was easy to earn back and didn't hold a grudge. We're still very good friends to this day.\n\nOverall, we had a good time on our trip. Although our friend was  single and wanted to explore the night life more, me and my partner enjoyed our time together in our hotel room and the public areas, we had a blast! We also connected a bit more with my friend over drinks and fun days. So everything turned out alright in the end. Thank you for all the responses that made me realize that I need to work on my confrontation skills and express my boundaries for my own, and my partner's, interests. I'm hoping that this post will encourage others in my shoes to do the same and hopefully come to a solution as friends and adults. Be respectful, understanding, and don't forget that we all have issues that we struggle with. Best is to encourage growth to strengthen ourselves and our relationships.",

    "body": "Two nights ago I was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we\u2019ve been wanting to try for a while. It\u2019s got a Michelin star so it\u2019s always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. \n\nWe got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. We essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. We got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. \n\nAnyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. They had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can\u2019t go up stairs in her current state (she looks VERY pregnant). \n\nLong story short, they end up approaching us asking if we\u2019d mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. My husband is like ok I guess but I simply said no, I called ahead to get this exact table and I want to stay here. The hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. She rolled her eyes at me and they just left. My husband thinks we should\u2019ve given up our table. AITA?\n\n**Edit**: To everyone asking for more details, here\u2019s a better breakdown of what happened. \n\nWe had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). We had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. The table I reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that\u2019s very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. I had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren\u2019t in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. Also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). \n\nWhen the other couple came in we didn\u2019t notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. Eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we\u2019d switch tables and they\u2019d comp our starters. The pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can\u2019t walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition I can\u2019t remember). My husband and I talked it over and I said no thank you we\u2019d like the stay here if possible. Honestly I didn\u2019t expect them to just leave the restaurant. I assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.\n\nThis is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said \u201cseriously?\u201d under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. I\u2019m like \u201cwhatever\u201d at this point and we go back to our meal. Some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but I guess they didn\u2019t want that (we weren\u2019t close enough to hear why). Finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. My husband and I are like \u201cobviously not we\u2019re not going to glug our wine and inhale our food\u201d and they relent and go tell the couple we\u2019re not moving. Then the couple leaves.\n\nActually, looking back now it\u2019s possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn\u2019t get our table and kept apologizing. I remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. Could be speculation but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn\u2019t want to piss them off.",

    "body": "Throwaway because some of my friends have reddit too. \n\n\nTo start my story off, let me give you some background info. I am a woman. My husband is a bisexual male leaning more towards straight, but is still bi. We have only recently gotten married, about 9 months ago. Before that we dated for a couple of years. My husband has always wanted to have a threesome with another bi man, as he could please both of us. I wasn\u2019t too comfortable with doing this, but last week, I finally agreed. My husband is very in with the lgbtq+ community in our area, so he knew exactly who he wanted to join us right away. We scheduled to have this event partake three days after my agreeing at the friends house, who we will call jim.\n\n\nNow fast forward to four days ago, the day of the threesome. I was very nervous, but my husband was excited to \u201c finally be able to have a good man in him\u201d as he said. We got to jim\u2019s house, and were brought inside. We had a few drink and then started. I don\u2019t want to make this too NSFW but what i will say was that both of them were involved with each other and me in multiple ways. But I guess my husband wanting for men was more than i expected, because after a few minute of foreplay and intercourse, it turned into my husband and jim just having normal sex. I saw what was happening, grabbed my clothes, ran out the house and into my car, and drove away almost in tears. Some people might see this as an overreaction, but in my mind, all my husband was doing was cheating on me with another man. I later texted him and told him he could stay at jim\u2019s house overnight, he wasn\u2019t welcome here. Later the next day jim dropped my husband off, who was not apologetic at all. He was mad at me for driving away, saying that he did nothing wrong, and that he just wanted to satisfy his needs. Most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.\n\n\nSo what do you think reddit, AITA for having a \u201cthreesome\u201d with my husband and his friend?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, we are no way at all in an open relationship.",

    "body": "edited to add- to the people out there with curly hair, i hear you and i understand! However, my daughter is 4. My husband and i both have worked hard to figure out how to care for her hair. He does play an active role in coming up with what she needs and i execute it. If i was willing to fight her tooth and nail every morning, i could style it into pretty curls, sure. But it is not worth it to me or my husband to do that to her because she hates it so much and we are not willing to override her bodily  autonomy just to make her hair look nice. It's just hair. What i'm doing is just getting the over-night matted rat's nest out. She does NOT have course hair. It is fine and smooth like mine and it because a matted mess just like mine, it can't be braided or put in a protective style, unfortunately. that will just rip her hair out. not that she would tolerate that, anyway. She removes anything or any style i've ever tried to do in her hair. even if she cooperates while i'm doing it, 5 minutes later, she'll just pull out whatever i put in. from french braids to hair clips and headbands. they're all a no-go.\nMy husband and i have put a lot of time and effort into finding out exactly how to best care for her hair, and this is really it for now. It's not the best for her HAIR but it is the best for her well being, as we've decided as her parents. We'll revisit her hair care when she's older, i promise. And i would NEVER use heat treatments on a child. i don't care if it curls or not. We just want her to look half groomed.\n\n\n--------------------------------\nSo I am white my husband is black and we have two daughters, ages 2 and 4. My 4 year old looks a lot like her (very handsome, if I might add) daddy. But she's got my texture hair with a massive amounts of curls that I usually am the one to take care of. Yesterday I brushed her hair in to a ponytail and put her in an old, very dated (but cute for the time!) outfit from when I was a kid in the 90's and recreated a photo of me when I was her age. I thought it was adorable but I received a lot of backlash from my \"woke\" friends and family (on my side, for the record. I'm not close to his family and they all just \"heart\" any pictures of my kids and rarely comment, if they do just to say they like the picture) accusing me of trying to make her \"white\". \n\nI've had underhanded comments before from them about \"erasing my kid's identity\" for brushing her hair? She's a child. To maintain her curls to look good requires quite a bit of time and products. Often she just lets me brush the rat's nest out of it and calls it a day. Any time I style it, she sticks her hands in it and messes it up. What else can I do? However, doing this does brush the curls out until her hair gets wet again. She HATES having her hair misted or dampeded and it's too cold for that now anyway. My husband doesn't care. He's happy she's clean and fed. \n\nTo wrap this up, I've had more than one person say I need to leave my more \"black-passing\" child's image alone and let her embrace being black, especially because, get this, my 2 year old is more \"white-passing\" with wavy light hair and my blue eyes. Including what I feel is dangerous advice to let her play outside without sunscreen. We have no idea what her sun tolerance is and I'm not about to deal with a small child having a sunburn I gave her on purpose. I have a low sun tolerance and don't tan, just burn like a boiled lobster. \n\nI'm going to be honest, this all blows my mind a little bit. My husband has never said anything of the sort. I've asked him about it and he said I don't need to worry about it. I don't let these people anywhere near my kids in person and some of them I can't avoid or just cut off. So am I being an asshole?",

My dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. My brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. I grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. Because of this I have no interest in having kids myself. My 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. \n\nMy mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. She has never worked although she doesn\u2019t do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. Her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.\n\nHowever now that\u2019s all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. She thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she\u2019s pregnant. Thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her BC for the last year and had hoped to have one more child. \n\nI lost my cool because my dad has a bad back and he should have retired this year. Now with the new baby he is saying he may have to work another ten years. I told my mom she\u2019s disgusting for doing that, and she had ten kids that\u2019s plenty enough \n\n\nShe burst into tears and ran out of the room, my dad told me to leave unless I was going to apologize and my 20 year old brother and 23,25 year old sisters told me I was an asshole. \n\nMy 28 year old brother and my gf said I maybe could have said it nicer but they think it\u2019s messed up. \n\nSo reddit was I the asshole?",

I asked him about the house music he was playing because I liked it too, in hopes he would crank it up. Instead, he began asking me what movie I saw, kept bringing up my \u2018boyfriend\u2019, asking me if I liked girls and so on.\n\nI found this topic of discussion inappropriate & honestly I didn\u2019t even want to talk in the first place, but since I was in a locked car with a stranger, I responded casually that I\u2019m not interested in anything & that I enjoy time by myself. \n\nThat did not deter him from asking me out right as I was going to exit the car. I reminded him that I prefer to be alone and left.\n\nPart of me says reporting him would make the ride more comfortable for other girls & also appropriate for my level of discomfort but another says that this man made an error of judgment and I should just give him a lower rating instead.\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for all your thoughtful responses. I sent the report in and quickly received a message from Lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. Do I want him fired? No, hence this post. I just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.\n\nEDIT 2: This is my final say on the matter. This was not a flattering event for me. My ride was uncomfortable due to the driver\u2019s lack of awareness & decorum. I too, work at a job where ratings matter. I do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. I was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. \n\nI did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today.

He'll comment later on how many people I have over, how late I have them over, etc. Like complaining I had a party of 7 over till 1 am.\n\nIf my grass gets too long, he'll comment on how I need to spend a day a week mowing; I can't keep \"going out 3 nights in a row\" \n\nIf there are cars parked in the street, he'll know which ones are friends there to see me. I know he knows because he goes right to mine and asks me to have my friends move their cars.\n\nIf I BBQ he'll complain about the smoke smells, and how nobody needs to be barbecuing for 3 hours.\n\nOverall, I can tell by the stuff he says that he's watching me and my house wayyy more than anyone has any right to. Knowing when I'm there or not, who's there with me, how long, etc. I've never noticed stuff like that about my neighbors, I mind my business. \n\nAnyway, it's kind of uncomfortable.

Watching when they're out in the yard, and what they're doing there. Think of how you'd feel.\"\n\nHe got upset at what I said and was saying \"That's different!!\" \n\nI was like \"It's NOT different. That's how I feel. I'm asking you to empathize here, to understand how it feels to be watched 24/7 and not be OK with it! How that seems to have made you feel is exactly how I feel!\" \n\nAfter that argument, he stormed off and has seemed to leave me alone for a few days.

I'm like 40% satisfied with my current job, and have been seeking something new. I've been on a few interviews to test the waters, and it's been pretty great so far.

    "body": "Throwaway.\n\nAbout a week ago my twin sister passed away suddenly. I don\u2019t want to go into the details but I am completely devastated by grief; I loved her more than anything else in this world. Even though I rarely got to see her in person we FT\u2019d a few times a week and We were very very very close.\n\nOn the other hand I am not close at all with my parents, who are in charge of planning the funeral which is scheduled for a weekend that is a few days before my wife\u2019s due date and will be taking place in our hometown which is about a 3 hour drive from where I live. I pleaded and pleaded with them to change the date but they\u2019ve already paid and set down the non refundable deposit and apparently it\u2019s the best time for all of our extended family who had to coordinate with time off and other things - so there\u2019s nothing I can do in terms of getting it rescheduled. Wife cannot come because she\u2019s been ordered to move as little as possible by her OB.\n\nI tentatively brought this up with my wife and she didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explore all the possibilities, she just straight up said hell no and she said that this would damage her trust in me because i won\u2019t be there when she needs me the most which I understand but I cannot comprehend how she expects me to miss this. I just can\u2019t.\n\nI want to fly there the night before the funeral and then fly back the morning after or the night of. If anything does happen I can reschedule the flight or leave immediately but she\u2019ll be in good hands because she\u2019s got her family to take care of her while I\u2019m gone and I\u2019ll be on FaceTime with her whenever I can.\n\nToday I brought it up again and I tried to be sympathetic with her but she still refused to budge. I then told her that I understand her position but that this is the last chance I\u2019ll get to say goodbye to my twin and there is zero chance of me missing that, absent a catastrophic event. She accused me of abandoning her and she\u2019s been ignoring me and acting cold to me\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to be specific: the funeral is 4 days before her due date.\n\nEdit 2: just to clarify a few things - her complications are that if she moves around too quickly then she gets nauseous. She\u2019s not on bed rest per se, just been instructed to kind of chill out if you know what I mean.\n\nThe funeral is scheduled for 12 noon on the day so I am perfectly fine with leaving around 8:30 then returning home whenever it is finished - so probably be back by 5, 6 at the latest. I have no plans to attend the reception and if for whatever reason I do then it won\u2019t be very long.\n\nHer family already does a heck of a lot for us, her mother Visits frequently when I\u2019m at work or out of the house and her sister spends a lot of time with her. I asked them if they\u2019d be willing to take care of her in my absence and they said that they\u2019d be glad to do it.\n\nLastly because some people have gotten a bit confused as to my wording, I originally said drive there but then I thought about it and there\u2019s flights Going from my city to my hometown, 9 departures on that day. So I thought it would be better to fly because the flight is 30 minutes so I\u2019d be away from my wife for less time but some commenters have said it\u2019d be better to drive in case something happens and I think they\u2019re right. Some people have also criticized me about saying it\u2019s \u201cmy wife\u2019s birth\u201d and she has been furious with me for saying \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant\u201d or sometimes \u201cmy child\u201d because she prefers me to say \u201cshe\u2019s pregnant\u201d and \u201cour child\u201d or even \u201cher child\u201d.",

He panicked and asked if I\u2019m serious. I said yeah and asked if he wants a kiss. EVERYBODY knows that it\u2019s the oldest and lamest trick in the world.

It\u2019s been going on for a few months, and we\u2019ve talked about it with his therapist, discussed it alone with him, giving him a lot of 1 on 1 time, we\u2019ve tried everything thinking maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s jealous of no longer being the baby. This morning I heard my 7 year old crying bloody murder and when I went upstairs to her bedroom I see my son with scissors and my daughters costume that we made together as a project was all cut up to pieces. \n\nI comforted my daughter, made him apologize and brought him downstairs. My husband and I asked him why he would do that and he said \u201cIt was ugly and I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d I told him that was the meanest thing he\u2019s done, and that he\u2019s grounded and can\u2019t go trick or treating.

After some time the bus stopped in the middle of nowhere right in front of a house, no official bus stop im sight. The first friend got off.\n\nThen we realized the bus driver was driving his friends home.

We were furious. Clearly, the bus driver thought that we as tourists wouldn't notice the detour.\n\nSo now we are debating on whether or not we should call the boss/manager of the bus company. So WIBTA if i complained? Or would that be too much of a Karen move?\n\nEDIT: Okay so the mods locked the comments a few hours ago. To clarify: I am NOT from America, I'm from Austria.

I finally talked to one who remembered turning away my daughter and Brett earlier in the night for trying to use fake IDs. I was livid. I wandered the area and eventually found my daughter and Brett hanging out at a coffee house. I waited for Brett\u2019s dad to park before going in. I asked him what his understanding of the situation was, and he told me as far as his ex told him, the kids were supposed to be at home doing prep work for a oratory competition. \n\nI told Brett\u2019s dad where I was and he and I walked into the cafe together to retrieve our kids. After we returned home, my daughter confessed to trying to sneak into a gay club with Brett, who apparently is closeted to his parents and school. She was most upset that I outed Brett to his parents this way. But she has not given me any reason to trust her or her friend Brett given their behavior this weekend. \n\nStricter rules are on the way. She continues to think I am the biggest villain in her entire world but really, if I hadn\u2019t installed an emergency phone in the car, I wouldn\u2019t have known the shenanigans these two were up to under the guise of studying. Sure, I violated her and Brett\u2019s privacy, but I feel it\u2019s justified.",

    "body": "I (26F) am the mother to a 5 year old beautiful girl. Only problem is she has my genetics... I had insomnia my entire life, took perscribed Ambien from 15 to till I got pregnant with my daughter at 20. Since I am a single mom, I can't be incapacitated by Ambien so I get around 3-4 hours a night and exist on coffee and the idea that I can sleep when she's 18. Unfortunately she's inherited my sleep issues. I've tried everything, she doesn't have screen time, has never had caffeine, limit sugar (even natural like fruit) after 5 pm, use lavender, and a sleep routine. No luck. I talk to her pediatrician who says I should try a small amount of melatonin. Since I started giving her melatonin she's been getting 9 hours versus 4 hours before. My 5 year old doesn't have dark circles under her eyes and her behavior and performance in preschool has improved. \n\nProblem is her father (29M), he lost all physical and legal custody but still has visitation. Her bedroom at her dad's has a TV, she shares it with her 2 year old sister who screams and stays up till 2 am and sleeps in till noon, and her dad and I don't have a stellar co-parenting relationship. He blames me for losing custody but in reality he let her insurance lapse 3 times and she developed stage 1 bedsores on his watch due to neglect. \n\nDaughter told him she takes her sleep gummy at mommy's and then she can sleep. He calls me screaming that I had no right to drug his child. I said I do since I have legal custody and it was in her best interest.. he opened a CPS case against me and says is making a play for legal custody. Doesn't want physical or even more visitation just wants the right to make decisions I'll pay for. He's over $8k in arrears and wants to eat that away. I followed the pediatrician and gave an OTC vitamin. AITA?\n\nEdit: Apologies for those that think I'm gloryposting.

    "body": "Pretty much says it in the title; whenever I initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. Yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. \n\nLast night we were fooling around and I got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. I was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. Finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. This has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh I doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. I know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but I know for a fact that I wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. \n\nShe has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like I said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. It's not a lube thing either, trust me I've tried that too. \n\nI guess the reason I'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. I lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how I didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. I told her that sex was becoming really boring and I could pretty much predict how it would go each time. I also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. She called me an asshole and went on the offensive. Said I have two moves and yet I expect her to be like a 'porn star'. \n\nSo am I the asshole? Or should there be more give and take in this scenario? Can I insist she gets a medical check?\n\n**TL;DR: girlfriend is in apparent pain any time I want to have sex, but is fine when she's the initiator. AITA for calling her out on it?**",

Also, this is a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and I don't want her to see this. \n\nAbout a year ago my (20M) partner (25F) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. She told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. I'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell I even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but I'm pretty into monogamy and told her that I wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. Note: I'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.\n\nLong story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that I told her I was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when I came out as bisexual. I eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) I don't have to hear about it in detail. She agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. She became noticeably happier after she started this, so I've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. \n\nThing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. I'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point I'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. It's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. It feels like we're just mates who share a bed. Conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and I'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. \n\nI brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying I had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that I was trying to police her sexuality. I'm now in a place where I'm completely torn. As I said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course I want her to be happy. And she really was very supportive of me when I came out as bi. But it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. I get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than I am, but it bums me out that I'm not enough for her. \n\nSo what do y'all think? Am I being an arsehole and should I just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? Or am I justified in being upset?\n\nETA: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so I'll post an explanation about how I'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. When I was a teen I was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. A dude in our building who I would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if I needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. My now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking I was ~17 (age of consent in the UK is 16). I didn't turn down her advances because I was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. Clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.",

We are all military families with young children and we have get togethers every weekend which includes booze.\n\nOne of my friends will drive home, with her 4 month old in tow, drunk. She insists her house is too close to uber and refuses rides from the rest of us. Her husband is trashed too. \n\nGranted, she only lives 15 minutes away, but that\u2019s 15 minutes after shots and beer pong, sometimes stumbling and throwing up. \n\nLast Friday, she was almost blackout drunk. She tried to bring my dog home instead of her own kid. Her husband loaded their baby up and they were slurring as they drove away. I insisted they stay overnight but apparently their baby can\u2019t sleep anywhere but her own crib. I offered to drive and they kept saying no. My husband thinks it\u2019s not a big deal and all my friends kept telling me to chill, their house is so close by.\n\nI picked up the phone and called 911 after sneaking into the bathroom. I gave them their license plate number and address. \n\nApparently they blew really high BAC and child protective services are now involved. My friends are all livid with me and even my husband is pissed. No one wants anything to do with us and my husband keeps trying to explain to me that I violated friend code in the military community. I have been blocked by everyone on social media and we are furthermore uninvited to future get togethers. My husband is so mad!\n\nI truly stand by what I did. Am I really the asshole here?! Everyone is so mad at me, am I just being a prude?! Help please\n\n**Update:** Thank you so much everyone for your votes of confident. I do feel a lot better, and thank you for the gold! I am getting a lot of nasty messages saying that I ruined a family and I should be ashamed, but I think they would be worse off if they died.\n\nAn update on my personal life- we\u2019re being interviewed by military police. The higher ranking people in my husband\u2019s chain of command are really thankful that the report was made. The lower ranking ones (my husband\u2019s peers) are pretty livid and any thanksgiving or Christmas plans made with my family have been taken back. We\u2019re going to have to get used to outcast life for a while since we\u2019ll live here for at least another year. My husband has calmed down but he has barely spoken to me and has been sleeping on the couch.\n\nI\u2019ve deleted all my social media accounts for now just because I\u2019m tired of being in the middle of this. I think I\u2019m going to take a small vacation and stay with my parents in another state, until I can get my head on straight. \n\n**Update 2:** To answer some of the questions people had about why I didn\u2019t try harder. \n\nI couldn\u2019t be around to collect their keys. I finished my shift and come home around 11pm (I work at a restaurant) and I just wanted to shower. Everyone had already been partying for hours by now. The baby started to cry and the couple insisted they needed to go. I offered to get them an uber or they could have the pull out couch or even our bed. I tried to get an uber through the app but my husband told me I needed to stop nagging and leave them alone. It\u2019s not easy trying to convince a drunk person to stay if they insist on leaving.\n\nNo it didn\u2019t occur to me to slash their tires or break their car battery.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about calling their command. My husband is a first year in the military and graduated boot camp earlier this year.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to exaggerate how drunk they were, when I tried to get them to stay I could hardly make out what they were trying to say besides \u201cshe needs her crib\u201d and \u201cour house is right there!\u201d \n\nTo answer how they knew it was me, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve tried to keep people from leaving a party before. There is a group text everyone is in and they asked me straight up if I made the call. I said I did. I didn\u2019t want to lie about it.",

    "body": "I (22f) am a cosplayer. I dress up for fun as anime characters and I've been doing that for five years now. I'm not a pro or anything, but I've learned how to sew, make foam armor, that sort of stuff, I'm sorta competent at it right now.\n\nA local anime convention near my town was having a cosplay contest. All you had to do was have your pic taken during the event and sent before their deadline and people would vote on them on Facebook. It was sort of informal and the prize was only a few gift cards so it wasn't a big deal. I don't have much of an online presence so I didn't think I would have a chance, but I decided to give it a shot anyway since I've been building a certain armor for a while and I thought it looked good. Without getting into the details, it's a warrior that happens to have an ample cleavage window. (yeah, I know, but I still love her)\n\nAfter voting had started, I was surprised at the positive feedback I was receiving. Some comments said I looked fierce, my wig was fantastic, my armor looked real, etc. A few of the comments also pointed out how I was \"really doing the character justice\" because of the size of my breasts, some more crudely worded than others. I left a like on all the replies since any praise was good. The only issue is: I'm flat as a board.\n\nUnderneath my armor, I was wearing what is quite literally a breastplate made out of silicon that gives me (in the words of a friend) some serious boobage. The armor had a neckpiece and shoulderpads, so the seams were perfectly hidden. Since the character's cleavage is sorta diamond-shaped, there's even underboob on display so it doesn't look like I'm just padding out a bra, it looks like the real deal.\n\nA week goes by and I get a notification on facebook. Apparently I won the contest. I was ecstatic, it was the first time my \"work\" had been recognized like that. I messaged some friends, they were all happy for me. I was reading the comments and one of them stuck out, saying he wasn't surprised I had won considering my body. So I decided to be snarky and reply with \"Well, if all that's needed to win a contest are boobs, here's where I bought mine!\" and linked the silicon breasts I was using.\n\nAnd apparently that was a mistake, since I got a few rude comments on that reply, some saying I was fooling people, some a bit more nasty saying I was just using a fake body just to get ahead of \"real cosplayers\". A few people even left mean comments on my facebook and instagram for that. I took a break from social media because they were being a pain in the ass.\n\nI told friends about what happened and some of them said I might have been the asshole for being snarky like that and I should have just accepted the prize and moved on, but I feel like this situation has escalated way too far. It even soured my mood towards that specific cosplay even though it's probably my best work so far. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all very much for all the love, I wasn't expecting this to blow up like this but I'm glad to know I was snarky but a bit justified. Knowing there are more people out there who bust their ass in complex costumes does make me feel better about my boobage.  \nSiliconE, not silicon, my bad on that. English isn't my first language.  \nFor those curious, my chestplate comes from Wirru aka Ameno Kitaro. He detailed the process of making Mai Shiranui's boobs on his Patreon and I just followed his tutorials since I wanted something custom for my skin tone and size. Look him up, his breasts look better than real ones, really. I should have written \"got\" instead of \"bought\" in the main post, sorry!",

    "body": "I (29F) was playing a dungeons and dragons game at a local game shop that met up through an app and \"Josh\" the DM (22?M) was a part time employee there. We had a game every other Monday with only a few missed sessions and it was all going well. I was happy to play as I usually DM. Then Josh started texting me outside of the group chat.\n\nIt was just friendly talk. I was nice back but didn't really push the conversation along. After about 2 weeks of texting he asked about my personal dating life and I told him very clearly that I am gay and have a girlfriend of 4 years. After that he kind of retracted, but he seemed to take it in stride. Everything was fine at our next session\n\nLast Saturday night I was home and he texts asking if I'm awake. I say yes and ask if everything\u2019s ok. He says he wants to hang out. I tell him I'm in for the night with my girlfriend and going to bed soon but (redirecting here) maybe at our next session the whole group can plan a little DND Christmas party. He sends eyeroll emojis and says he'd rather it be us two, but \"maybe \\[my\\] girlfriend can join too so \\[we\\] can worship his stallion cock\u201d then sends me a nude. I tell him he's way out of line and he needs to stop texting me before I show everyone in our group. He begs me not to, so I say I won't.\n\nHe texts me the next day and apologizes and begs me not to tell anyone. He says he was blacked out and would never do something like that. I told him what he did was unacceptable but if he agrees not to text me inappropriately again I'd forgive him and not mention it. He agreed.\n\nMy girlfriend tells me I'm being too nice and I shouldn't forgive him so easily. I thought about it and decided she\u2019s right and I should teach him a lesson. I waited til our next session. He looked nervous when he saw me but I just acted like everything was normal. I waited til everyone got there then briefly excused myself. As I was walking back, I sent a screenshot of my and Josh' text convo. I covered his weiner with eyeroll emojis. Immediate chaos. Josh went white as a sheet and everyone was shouting. He was stammering trying to explain but the store owner came over and yells above the noise and asked what the hell was going on. Everyone looks at Josh but he\u2019s frozen so I hand her my phone to see. She looks and just tells Josh he\u2019s fired and to get the fuck out of her store. He bolts and the owner hands me my phone and walks away.\n\nIt was really awkward after that. We all kind of gathered our stuff and made halfhearted plans to start a new campaign and left. Group chat was dead, but two of the other players have texted me individually and expressed that they were mad cause I ruined the game and I should have addressed it with him privately instead of embarrassing him and getting him fired. I just didn't respond, but it did get me thinking I maybe could have handled that better. AITA?\n\nEdit: Holy shit I did not expect this response. I went to dinner and a move last night and woke up to over 1k comments. The thread is locked so I guess I can't respond to anyone, but thank you all for your input.

I am well aware that if I file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. I make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.\n3. I fear that opening this door will open others. That is, I worry that he may have other children that I don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and I don't think that now is the time to handle it.\n\nMy question is, does my plan make me an asshole? I feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but I fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. AITA?\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that my daughter will be 18 in September, so child support for the next year isn\u2019t as cut and dry",

Only thing I like to do is gaming and reading so I just want to spend whatever time I have doing things I enjoy. My parents are devastated but they always maintain a happy face in front of me. My aunt is not happy with this fact I don't know where she reads things but she is suggesting to me and to my parents to do various things before I die like.\n\n\n\n1)Family trip(including her family) to a foreign country to make happy memories. The thing is it will be paid by my parents and I don't want them to spend their hard-earned money on it. We are not that rich and how on earth any parent make an happy memory when they know their kid is going to die.\n\n\n\n\n2)Writing a letter to 40+(all extended) family member. I don't want to spend my time writing a letter to relatives I didn't even meet yet.\n\n\n\n3)Spend time with my friends(karting, baseball etc). When I told her I don't have any friends she suggested me to go with her son's friend. I dont want to do that too.\n\n\n\n\nShe was really angry when I rejected her every proposal and rambled about I am dying without enjoying life etc. For the next part, I think I am kinda TA she was once charged with drunk driving and has a terrible driving record. I told her she should also write a letter to everyone as knowing her driving she could die before me. She was livid and left quickly. My mother told me I am TA I should have simply refused her help. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I do have some friends but I am not that close to them. Also, I am not sad for death everyone is going to die sooner or later. What triggered me was her perception of enjoying life. I am extremely comfortable with my own ways and I don't want to either have much time left to learn new things. I just want to do things that I love reading playing games etc.\n\nEdit1: When she suggested foreign trip my father insisted on paying for it. Trust me she was not looking for free trip.\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: Thanks for response guys. Also, I am getting pm by kind redditors who are willing to give me a steam card or money for books. Please don't do that I am not looking for anything. I already have too much of backlog I am not sure whether I could complete that. Also, I am financially stable there is no need to give me anything.

    "body": "So like 3 months ago when I was looking for a job my cousin suggested I work at the restaurant she works at. At the time I was like yeah that sounds cool, but had also just started working for doordash just to have income. However I actually enjoy doordash and delivering, plus I like the flexibility. So the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. \n\nHowever I just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she\u2019d tell them about me again. So she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. I really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus I\u2019m content with what I\u2019m doing now. However I spontaneously said yes. But now the interview is in an hour and I honestly don\u2019t want to go. But my cousin gave me a reference and said she\u2019s excited to work with me but I just don\u2019t know how to feel or what to do. Truth is I really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. I know I accepted the interview but, idk....\n\nEdit: I\u2019m on my way to the interview now. I know for my cousins reputation the least I can do is show up. I\u2019m just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job I\u2019ll have a more thought out answer\n\nEdit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now\n\nEdit 3: actually glad I went because the reason I was hesitant was because i thought they\u2019d be hiring me as a host. However they said they\u2019re looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they\u2019d cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries. That\u2019s more than I have with doordash so I actually am interested in this position now. They set me up for another interview. Thank you to everyone here who called me an asshole and made me feel bad so I\u2019d get my ass to the interview. Actually worked out in my favor.\n\nlast edit: it was definitely an interesting day. Initially when I posted this, within the first 3 minutes about 5 people said I was the asshole. That made me feel pretty bad so I went to go to the interview 10 minutes after posting. Edit 1 occurred 10 minutes after the post, edit 2 about 20-30 minutes after edit1, then edit3 about 45 minutes after. Glad you all enjoyed the read.",

    "body": "I\u2019ll just get right into it. My aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. We never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. I immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but I attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. My brother (who\u2019s 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but I didn\u2019t think anything of it because why would I? \n\nI came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. The more I listened, the more I realized someone was definitely having sex. I instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. His door was somewhat open so I rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. I instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. In there I pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (I knew it was fucked up, but not like this) Then I just felt scared. I didn\u2019t know what it meant. I knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. \n\nSo the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. \n\nMy brother is now very upset with me. He told me that they\u2019re two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren\u2019t hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and he\u2019s planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck wondering if I made an asshole move by \u201ctelling\u201d on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn\u2019t let her deal with this on her own. He also said he\u2019s been in love with her since he was a kid. Before he left, he told me that he isn\u2019t angry with me and apologized for being upset before. I told my mom he left and she had no reaction.",

They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they\u2019ll be great parents. I then asked Peter \u201cdid she get your blue eyes?\u201d (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn\u2019t visible) Peter and his girlfriend\u2019s tone completely changed and his girlfriend said \u201cJesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. It\u2019s fucking weird\u201d I was pretty taken aback by her reaction. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it I was just curious. I thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn\u2019t mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.\n\nI told my mom what happened and she said that Peter\u2019s girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting her baby but that I didn\u2019t say anything wrong. However my sister said I was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since Peter\u2019s girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican). This didn\u2019t make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad. My eyes are brown! I was just curious!\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: Yeah ok Peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. I apologized again for offending them. He accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she\u2019ll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they\u2019ve been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people\u2019s fixation on eye color and feels there\u2019s some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are \u201cwhite features\u201d and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn\u2019t have blue eyes. Apparently his mom said during her pregnancy \u201ctoo bad she probably won\u2019t have blue eyes\u201d and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks. I feel really bad now.\nAnd he said the baby\u2019s eyes are grey.",

I'm a guy's guy and I grew up with only brothers so I feel strongly that I want a son to bond with. That's not to say that I don't love my daughter equally. I just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. After some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying.

Ben said that she \u201cblindsided\u201d him with this information, and that he \u201ccan\u2019t stay hard with condoms on\u201d, so it will ruin their sex life. But what got him most mad was that she decided to stop taking birth control without talking it over with him, and she can\u2019t be making huge decisions like that on her own without consulting him. She did not like how mad he got about it and it turned into an extremely ugly argument that ended with her breaking up with him.  \n\nBen was devastated and wanted a few guys and me to meet him at his bar. He told the story and all of my buddies were on his side. I was kinda shocked. I told him that it sucks he got dumped and i felt bad but at the same time he was in the wrong here. I went on about how taking birth control is totally up to her, and he can be \u201cbummed\u201d by the decision because sex without condoms is way better, but if she doesn\u2019t want to take birth control, it\u2019s her choice. I have a wife and lots of female friends, and I\u2019ve heard countless rants on why birth control sucks and taking it can be a nuisance. It\u2019s not like she told him about it mid sex, she told him right away. Then i said, half jokingly although it\u2019s kind of accurate, \u201ci love you man, but that was toxic af\u201d and yes i said it like that to be comically dick. He did not like my response and said I was being an asshole. My one friend took me to the side and said that \u201cthis is no time to act woke, and that a bro always takes the bro\u2019s side in a breakup\u201d. It\u2019s not like I plan on being friends with her and ditching my friend. I\u2019m still gonna be friends with him, I just now know he has some warped opinions on birth control etiquette, and can\u2019t hold a boner in condoms. \n\nBut maybe I did pick the wrong time to point out that he was wrong, maybe I should\u2019ve just empathized with him for losing his gf. I kind of feel like I broke the bro code for a trivial reason and I could\u2019ve just said \u201cthat sucks\u201d and moved on.\n\nEDIT: I feel I should clarify this because it seems to be something brought up a lot in the comments. She told him the day she stopped, it wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t been taking BC and just told him now, she stopped the day she told him. Guess I should\u2019ve said \u201cshe\u2019s stopping taking BC\u201d. Poor wording on my part. Sorry all. \n\nTLDR: My friend got dumped by his girlfriend after an argument that stemmed from him saying she shouldn\u2019t have stopped taking birth control without consulting him, and i told him that she had a point and he was in the wrong.",

We hit it off and officially became exclusive three months ago.\n\nOverall she\u2019s a really great person. But there\u2019s a few things about her that bother me, and I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s normal or not because I\u2019ve never really been in an actual serious relationship.\n\n-I always pay for everything on dates. I know that I make more than her and it doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt me to always pay, but she doesn\u2019t ever offer to pay or split the bill and she just expects me to always pay.\n\n-The first time she came over to my apartment she was literally shocked. I live in a shitty one bedroom apartment because I want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible so I still basically live like a broke college student. She kept making comments about how I should move out and find a nicer place that suits a doctor.\n\n-She wanted to introduce me to her family right away. I thought the relationship is too new to meet the parents but she insisted. And when we went to their house, her parents only asked about my job and salary.\n\n-When we went out and ran into someone she knows she introduced me as her doctor boyfriend.\n\nThese things, plus some other stuff made me realize she doesn\u2019t really care about me, just that I\u2019m a doctor. So I told her. She blew up, saying I\u2019m insulting her and calling her a gold digger, and that she\u2019s just proud of me for being successful.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n1)  I wanted to clear something up, my apartment is NOT dirty. When I said I live in a shitty one bedroom apartment I just meant that it\u2019s really small.

My boss told them that I am one of the top account managers in our unit and asked me what advice I can give the new hires on how to succeed at this job.\n\nI said that our job is 30% work and 70% luck, sometimes you get big deals with minimal effort and sometimes you give it everything you have but the deal still doesn\u2019t push through. But what\u2019s important is to have good relationships with your co-workers because work is much easier when you have a positive work environment.\n\nAfter the meeting my boss talked to me and he was not happy about the advice I gave. He said that he wanted the new hires to see me as a role model but instead I embarrassed him by encouraging them to be complacent since I said that 70% of the job is luck. He said that I know the advice I should give them is to set goals and work hard to achieve them as their careers are just beginning but I went with trying to sound cool instead of giving them the best advice.\n\nI specifically avoided telling the new hires that they should work hard because I don\u2019t work hard myself and everyone else in the room knows that. I\u2019m not humble bragging. I was always an average employee, I just got lucky these past three years because even without asking my clients brought me their friends who also ended up doing business with me so the deals basically just fell into my lap. But even now I have a lot of lazy days where I procrastinate or I go on sudden leaves just because I don\u2019t feel like working.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be that person who doesn\u2019t practice what she preaches, but should I have told them what they needed to hear instead of what I really wanted to say?\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up.\n\nThank you to everyone who is worried that I might get fired or I won't be promoted because of what I said, thankfully promotions in our company depend on your performance. We have guaranteed merit increases as long as we meet their our budgets, and if you go over your budget you get a bigger increase. Unless I do something against company policies or I don't meet my budget for three straight years my boss also can't recommend my termination. Even then it's not my immediate boss who decides if I get fired, so I think I'm pretty safe.\n\nI still believe that a big part of my achievements in the past three years is down to luck. I didn't do anything different than what I did the past five years. I was nice and accommodating to my clients before but they didn't refer any deals or the ones they did did not push through. I don't know what changed these last three years. But the reality is that the clients came to me and from there I just had to type some templated proposals.\n\nIn contrast I have coworkers who bust their ass marketing new clients on their own, they have good relationships with their existing clients but do not get referrals, or they make somersaults to sort out terms and conditions to make a deal happen but the client suddenly says he doesn't need the deal anymore. That's why I think that I've been lucky and I know this luck is not gonna last forever.\n\nBut I see your point that maybe I shouldn't have said what I did at a formal meeting like that in front of my boss.",

Honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today when I got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers I had cooked last night. I told her \"Wow, I love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that I was looking forward too.\" before I started oinking at her. She broke down crying and ran out.  She's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an \"asshole\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm i? Like, we asked her so much to stop and she didn't that i honestly just lost it. We all buy our own food and we have a rule never to touch each others stuff. She knows this and she still did it so I think she deserved it.",

    "body": "My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.\n\nMy wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.\n\nSo I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.\n\nWell, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.\n\nAITA for not wanting to change the dog's name?",

    "body": "My bridesmaid and I have been friends for a long time. She\u2019s always been on the heavier side but for the last few years, each time I see her, she\u2019s put on more and more weight. Her mother is also obese and has countless health conditions due to her weight and diet. I\u2019ve been concerned about my bridesmaid for a while so I\u2019ve invited her to come with me to the gym (she almost always bails), I come over and make healthier versions of her favorite foods, we go on walks instead of driving, etc.\n\nA long time ago, I found the perfect bridesmaid dress. However, after more research, my bridesmaid\u2019s size is a few sizes larger than the largest dress size. I let her know a year and a half in advance the situation and she insists on me keeping the dress and that she would lose weight. She seemed very excited about it and said this would be her motivation. I bought the dresses and ordered hers in the size she said she would become by the time of the wedding. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve told her and I continuously see her post stories of her eating whole pizzas, drinking several sodas a day, and laying in bed watching Netflix all day. I\u2019m very concerned for her health but I travel for work and can\u2019t see her often to make food and go on walks with her. \n\nWIBTA for telling her she can\u2019t be my bridesmaid anymore if she can\u2019t fit into her dress?\n\nEDIT: I wouldn\u2019t have bought the dresses had she not been comfortable with the sizing! I would have looked for other options. But I told her the situation and she told me which size to order for her.",

My SIL is a kind of neurotic, tense person, a perfectionist, and she and I have never gotten along, but we're polite and civil for my big brother's sake. Plus, I love my nieces, so being nice to her is just carte blanche.\n\nThey have a small house so while I'm here they've had the younger daughter share a bed with the older one, giving me the five year old's bed. I knew right away that the little bed was gonna be waaaaaay too short but after my seven hour drive I just wanted some sleep. My feet stuck off the end a good foot and a half.\n\nThe next night I just took the pillow and blanket and slept on the floor next to the bed. There was a rug so it wasn't too bad but definitely not the best. The next day I waited until everyone was asleep and went out to the sofa. I was still too tall but it was better than the floor. Next day SIL asked me not to sleep on the sofa via text message after she went to work. That night I slept on the floor again and the next morning SIL came in to see if I wanted breakfast and found me sleeping there.\n\nIt became this huge thing and culminated with me leaving to stay in the only hotel in the small town they live in, which is a thirty minute drive from their ranch. Now my brother and SIL are pissed at me, the nieces are sad that I'm not sleeping over. AITA for sleeping on the floor or should I have just sucked it up?",

    "body": "So Thursday, I went to a party one of my friends threw. It was your pretty standard college party and I got pretty drunk yada yada. When I went back to my house, I was stumbling around trying to get to my room. One of my housemates helped me to my room and told me to sleep it off which I planned to do. \n\n\nI don\u2019t remember too much since I blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told me. My roommate was in the room when I came in and he said I kept falling off the bed and talking to myself. He ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently the EMTs forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if I didn\u2019t go so I didn\u2019t have a choice. \n\nWhen I woke up in the hospital the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. They also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. Since I was basically dragged to the hospital, I left my keys and phone inside so I couldn\u2019t get in. None of my housemates were home so I ended up just waiting outside of the house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. On top of that, I missed my CAD class which is a whole different story. \n\nI was absolutely pissed with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. Not only did I end up spending the night at some hospital, I got a $1000 bill on top of it too. It\u2019s one thing if I had alcohol poisoning or something like that but I literally just slept at the hospital and left the next morning. The housemate who helped me inside was on my side, he said I was hammered but it wasn\u2019t that bad and I could just sleep it off. The roommate said he got scared and didn\u2019t know they would take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the police rather than ask the others. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not mad at my roommate for calling the ambulance. If I looked that ducked up, I would probably do the same. I\u2019m upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct rather than ask the other roommates. I mentioned my other housemate said I was super drunk but I could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call the cops. I didn\u2019t get any tests at the hospital, I literally just slept there for the night and left when I woke up. Some of the comments are correct in that the American healthcare system is unfortunately part of the issue here. I was willing to endanger myself rather than pay a $1000 bill I can\u2019t afford. If that makes me TA, then so be it.",

    "body": "AITA for refusing to eat with my friend because he\u2019s vegan? \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI met my friend Alex in my second year of university when we were both cast in a play together. We hit it off with similar interests and decided to live together last year. \n\nA bit of background: Alex is a vegan - and I mean that as literally as I can. He is a philosophy student and LOVES debating. I think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. Alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. He brings it up daily. He has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. He has said, and I am directly quoting, that \u201cEating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don\u2019t think the lives of black people have meaning.\u201d He has said \u201cEating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting ISIS.\u201d \n\nHe is not joking. \n\nHe calls anyone who eats meat \u201ccarnist pigs\u201d. He says this to their face while they eat. He believes it is his life\u2019s mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. If we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he\u2019ll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. He\u2019ll constantly say \u201cHey, check this out!\u201d and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. By constantly, I mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. He\u2019ll come into your room to show you his plate. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t disagree with him morally. We\u2019ve had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and I concede on many of his points. There\u2019s no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. Where I take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. I have started eating out, or at other people\u2019s houses. I\u2019ve been packing my lunches in secret because I just don\u2019t want to deal with him. \n\nIf anyone tells Alex to piss off, he responds with \u201cCool, have fun murdering!\u201d or \u201cEnjoy your death sandwich!\u201d \n\nSo flash forward to today. We\u2019re in line at a burrito restaurant. I\u2019m ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how I could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. Similar to the crap he always says. \n\nI look him dead in the eye and tell him, \u201cMan, if you don\u2019t stop doing this shit when we eat, I\u2019m not going to eat with you anymore. The way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, I\u2019m not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this.\u201d \n\nHe laughed and told me to chill. I said I was dead serious. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. Not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn\u2019t expire until May. I\u2019d love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.\n\nSo, AITA? How should I go about navigating this? \n\nEdit #1: Obligatory wow, this blew up comment! Thank you for chiming in. For those of you saying this is pretty one-aided - like, yeah. I was mainly seeking advice on how to handle it going forward, and writing it down helps you clarify how crazy shit is when it happens. And I got a lot of helpful tips so thanks! \n\nFor those asking why we are friends: he can be a great guy. We get along and agree on about 95% of other subjects. We have a history together now. I was used to him making jabs, but didn\u2019t know he was this insufferable until we lived together. \n\nFor those saying this is fake - man, I wish. I constantly tell him not to behave like a meme of himself. So I get why it might read that way, but he\u2019s legit.",

He\u2019s angry because it\u2019s not his fault I don\u2019t get off, which is true. I can\u2019t get off just from PIV sex, and he doesn\u2019t like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). \n\nI\u2019ve told him twice now, politely, that I\u2019m unsatisfied and I\u2019d like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). He agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn\u2019t make the effort because he doesn\u2019t get anything out of it. So I said \u201cwell yeah that\u2019s literally the definition of \u2018bad in bed\u2019\u201d. He got angry and said it\u2019s my job to \u201cmake\u201d him do those things.

    "body": "I(38m) have a TBI and I am completely deaf on my right side. My hearing loss/TBI happened later in life and was caused while deployed. So I've always told everyone I interact with please stand on my left side, speak slowly, and clearly so that I can hear you. I help myself as well by turning my ear towards them slightly and focusing on their lips. I can't quite read lips but it helps. \n\nSo I have this roommate we will call F, F is an ok guy for the most part but F likes to fuck with me on occasion. Normally the jokes are alluding to I'm dead because I'm an old man and I joke back with him about it. \n\nBut lately, I've been worried my hearing was getting worse because F always speaks on my good side but I'm catching maybe every couple of words and nothing else. I'll be in the middle of doing something and F will say aren't you going to go do this as I asked you to? And I'll be legitimately confused because I don't recall agreeing but say ok sure. I do legitimately have memory loss issues combined with my hearing problem it was entirely possible I had said yes.\n\nMy GF has been sheltering in place with us and last night F came in to ask me a question. Again I was only catching every couple of words when my GF stopped him saying knock it off F that's fucked up. I asked what was fucked up and she tells me F is just moving his lips and not saying anything except those couple of words I am catching. F laughed about it and said he was pissed my GF ruined his joke. Because to top it off he admitted has been evidently using my hearing loss and telling me I agreed to shit during conversations that never took place. \n\nI will admit I was legitimately angry it's bad enough I can't hear people normally but to exploit it purposefully to mess with me for your own humor is fucked up! I told him all of this but F just laughs about it saying it's not his fault I can't hear or remember things. Besides, it's entertaining for him. I told him he was being a jackass and to fuck off with that bullshit. He said I was being an AH that it wasn't as big a deal as I was making it out to be. But I think it was he exploited my issues for his own gain.\n\nExamples: he's gotten me to buy all the groceries and not contributed saying I agreed to it when I never did. If he had just asked me, in reality, I would have most likely said yes depending on the actual circumstances.\n\nHe's gotten me to fix his car for free, again I would have probably done it if he had asked. \n\nHe thinks I'm being an AH who is overreacting and since I would have probably said yes he doesn't see what the problem is. I think I'm not the AH here at all and even if I cursed him out he had it fucking coming. My GF is on my side but our other roommate thinks I should apologize for cussing him out just to keep the peace while we are all stuck together.",

    "body": "About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn\u2019t get in to see her for 3 weeks.\n\nWhile I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it\u2019s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.\n\nALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m frustrated, however.\n\nOnce I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it\u2019s so rare, they don\u2019t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven\u2019t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it\u2019s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.\n\nTonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister\u2019s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. I\u2019m just jealous that I\u2019ve been forgotten about while I\u2019ve learned that I could die young & that I have an autoimmune disorder that I\u2019ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

    "body": "Little bit of backstory: I really enjoy Pok\u00e9mon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. Doing this means I have a very large collection of valuable cards. I still love at my parents house (I\u2019m 18), and I keep them all on a shelf in my room. My nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago I got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks I had built for the tournament later in the day. I go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. I immediately freak out because I have them all very organized and well-kept. My nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. He also isn\u2019t ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you\u2019d understand if you met him and my family). So I go into his room to look for them. Lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack\u2014oh and my binder was completely empty. At this point I was *beyond* furious and all I could mutter was \u201c Oh my God\u201d over and over. \n\nAfter I pick everything up that I could find, I go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. He kept saying he didn\u2019t do it and he didn\u2019t steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). So I get even madder if that\u2019s possible and I smack the shit out of his leg. Then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what\u2019s going on. I couldn\u2019t even get a word out before the child went up to him and said I was trying to kill him. My nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if I ever lay another finger on him. \n\nAfter they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. His punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). He also said he hates me and wished I would just move out and die. My parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that I\u2019m a child abuser and if I did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what I did and didn\u2019t make it a big deal). All in all I recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards I probably lost about $180 of cards. \n\nSo am I the asshole in this situation? Was I overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don\u2019t? I get that it\u2019s not my place to do that, but I completely think that it was deserved and I honestly feel that I should\u2019ve smacked him again. He goes back to school today and I have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she\u2019s going to confiscate every Pok\u00e9mon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. Sorry for the lengthy post but I needed to vent my frustrations. AITA? \n\nTLDR: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while I was working; I get home and find out and I smack the shit out of him. Then I\u2019m threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time I put my hands on him. \n\nEdit: holy shit my inbox \nand to clear up a few things:\n\nnStepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists \n\nI made this post looking for objective opinions, I personally think he deserved it but what I did was wrong and therefore I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nWe made it to front page :O now everyone will know I\u2019m an asshole D: \n\nEdit 2: I had the intention of replying to most of the comments but that\u2019s no longer reasonable.

    "body": "So basic background is I\u2019m 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in April after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get my fair share from him. The details of \u201cwhy\u201d are not important but I\u2019m angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. A lot of this has to do with feeling like I\u2019ve been \u201creplaced\u201d by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything I\u2019m\nnot. My husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but Jesus Christ...give me a break. \n \n\nMy husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. So this past weekend I picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. They said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and Aunt Stacey and Uncle Brian (my brother and sister who I didn\u2019t even know were in town). I was like your dad took you? They said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. I was devastated because while I don\u2019t get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me.

She was killed instantly. \n\nOf course when I got the call, I was devestated. We had been married for just two years. Now I was only 27 and widowed. It took months of healing and regaining my faith in God and in this world to move. In part of that healing, I posted a tribute of her to my Instagram (at the time of her passing) saying all these things I wanted her to be remembered for. I ended it with \"I will always love you, *name*, rest in peace my love.\"\n\nA few months ago I met a new girl at work. We hit off really well and things picked up fast. She was a bit controlling, but I kind of liked it, that someone was really protective of me. It wasn't overbearing controlling, but just enough to make me feel cherished. A few days ago though, (and my now GF knows of my deceased wife), said she saw my tribute post to her and asked if I could take it down. \n\nI was really confused and asked why; she said \"it has love, that is the present tense, do you still love her?\" and \"its been three years, you need to move on.\" \n\nI told her \"I loved my late wife, and I have moved on, that why I felt ready to date you.\" She then said \"if thats true, you should have no problem deleting the post.\" I dont want to delete the post though. She was still my wife, she died tragically, she deserves to be remembered for more than just being a wife, she was  great person - and a nurse, too. \n\nAITA if I don't delete the post?

The woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. Her son and I have been together almost 7 years. We have two kids. She's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call CPS if we didnt bow to her wishes. Suffice to say this woman is insane, and we DID end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.\n\nSo, we are no contact with her off and on. Currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. The most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. It's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. Now, maybe I'm just being petty because her and I obviously dont get on, but I'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.\n\nMy boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. So I was INSTANTLY suspicious of this fucking thing. I disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.\n\nI was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a MUCH better idea than disabling it.\n\nPut it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.\n\nI feel like disabling it is enough, but I would be lying if I said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. Is it over the top to do this if I'm pretty confident that she WOULD just drop in and see this happening?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: alright y'all, this has been wild. Thank you for all your replies. Whether you're in the asshole camp or not, it's been fun to read your comments! I'm not going to do it, as the general takeaway here is that it will cause a headache I dont need. But some commenters have given me some G rated alternatives that I'm definitely going to try.

Switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. Now, I have a small phobia of my own. My father was very abusive, and of the few memories I have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. As such, I'm very uncomfortable around them. My boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when I get upset and tell him to stop he says I need to get over it. That I might need to use one some day. That I should know he'd never hurt me. I guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, I'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? But it's not like I think that to begin with, I'm just uncomfortable around them.\n\nWell, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. I don't question it. For some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. He completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights. If there's a chance of one showing up in a video he will whimper and whine and either stop it all together or close his eyes and ask me to tell him when it is over. I promised him early on that I didn't find it funny like some of his friends do and wouldn't use it to prank him.\n\nWell, the other night after cutting some cheese with his stupid knife, he tried waving it at me, knowing how uncomfortable it makes me. So I pulled up a particularly horrifying image of his phobia on my phone and shoved it in his face. \"How does it feel? You know what a phobia is like, right? Just get over it!\" I tried to paraphrase him, and he got really upset. I feel like I may have gone overboard and honestly feel guilty, but he hasn't messed with me since.",

    "body": "Hello! I posted here before about this girl before because she used to constantly have the heat on in summer. We got that worked out but now everything else is a problem.\n\nI just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. Our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. The rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. \n\nMe and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. She's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. \n\nThe first issue that I had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. \nThe school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but I like it. The 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. We started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. \n\nShe had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. It was super fun to me\n\nThis girl has had friends over but complains when I have mine over, and I heard her talking to her friends about us. I have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. When me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. \n\nShe's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which I understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. \n\nWell, last night I bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. I thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. This girl went OFF. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and I should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. I got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to Target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. When I was out, I picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. I told her \"nobody consulted me over the dish soap\" and left. That was probably a bad thing to say but I was mad and sad.\n\nShe sent me a long text this morning about how I'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. I'm just hurt honestly, but maybe I'm the asshole and she's reasonable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUpdate: I walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so I just decided to put it in a corner as I didn't want to cause more drama. I sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. It's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. I genuinely miss living alone.\n\nEdit: I emailed the RA for my floor and he and i talked about the issues I was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an RA to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm\n\nEdit 2: telling me to drop out of art school is not helpful in any way and your opinion is not wanted. I worked hard to get here and my college tuition was paid for by scholarships and the generosity of others. please respect my decision to be here.",

My girlfriend and I just finished building a small retaining wall of brick along the sidewalk and have noticed it regularly being walked/climbed on. The wall is about three feet tall.\n\nOriginally we were going to plant a lot of flowering bushes along the top of it but we're pretty sure they will be destroyed slowly by the daily coming and going of the kids. We also don't want to be liable for anyone falling and getting hurt. We were at Home Depot to buy flowers the other day when we saw some neat looking bushes that are also a bit pokey. That's when I got the idea to use them as a deterrent. So, will I be the asshole if I plant them along the top of the wall?\n\n**Thank you for the different plant suggestions! Keep em comin! I live in a zone 7 climate.\n\n** There seems to be a minority rising that think I'm out to fuck these kids over and that is very much not the case. I just don't want them climbing all over the wall, which is already happening. I used the term \"pokey bushes\" intentionally as I just want a *deterrent*. Something that is more scary than damaging but will be effective if they actually try anyway. (lol, the people suggesting cholla catus!)\n\n**Due to demand, I'll try to post pictures when it's done.

The pictures aren't super great and unfortunately, the plants are still quite small as they have just been planted. We're also not done landscaping this portion. Need more fabric to stop weeds and we are going to put something over it(mulch or my GF wants some small black rocks). As for the pokey plants, the plant nearest to the camera is *wild rose* and following the wall we planted a few *lantana*. Both of which should grow out over the wall in the next two years or so. Behind those we have some random white flowers, some salvia and lavender. We then planted a little fig tree and two lilacs on either side of the front door. In the background to the right we planted a jasmine to grow alone the fence. If someone wants to remind me, I can take pictures again next year for some plant growth progress.",

She comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(EDIT: My mind was going at a million miles per hour when I typed this. This is not an all-encompassing statement. When I typed it I was focused on my current situation. I would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, I just expected to never raise these children and I do not want to.)** . She agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. \n\n  \nI just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because I'm just ranting. I will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  I told her hell no, I made it clear very early on that I do not want to raise those kids. She told me that she assumed I would \"grow out of it\" and accept them. We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   I am 22, she is 20. I think even if I wanted to adopt these kids I would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (She works at a make up store, I work at a grocery store for fucks sake)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't straight up told her that I am planning on leaving yet but I've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.

She\u2019s 18.5 but hasn\u2019t graduated high school yet and has no real plans with respect to work or college. (She would have already graduated but that\u2019s a whole other story). \n\nWhat I mentioned in the title was my final straw. I trusted her to leave her alone but ended up coming home early when my plans got ruined last minute. (Was hanging out with a group of friends, but the host\u2019s kid got sick, so we all ended up leaving early). So I walk in on my daughter in my bed with some guy I don\u2019t even know. \n\nI told her I have had it and she\u2019s going to live with her dad. That means she\u2019s either going to have a 45 min commute to school or transfer. I don\u2019t really care which at this point because I am at my breaking point. If her dad won\u2019t take her in full time, she can go live with friends, I guess, but I\u2019m not planning on giving financial support.

I said, in that case, she can take her! But at this point, I feel like I\u2019m done.\n\n**Edit: I came here for judgment, but some of the comments implying that I might have \u201cabused\u201d my daughter or that I somehow \u201cdeserved\u201d for my space to be violated this way because I\u2019m a \u201cshit mom\u201d are really shocking.

Over a 180 day term (plus weekends) students must clock in 60 hrs of physical activity on a Fitbit provided through the school. There aren\u2019t set exercises or anything like that. The students do whatever they want, and as long as the Fitbit registers it, it counts. For example, my son and one daughter got theirs through sports, but my other daughter looks up dance routines on the computer. \n\nAlso, the 60 hrs can be divided however a student wants. They can do an hour a day and be done in two months, or they can do 20 minutes a day for the whole 180, or any other combination, as long as it gets done. There are smaller goals throughout the year, like 30 hrs by midterm in December and 15 hrs by the end of October. \n\nMy niece hasn\u2019t met these goals. In fact, she hasn\u2019t registered a single minute of what the Fitbit counts as real physical activity. And she says it\u2019s not a malfunction. She thought that walking to class and drama (even though by her own admission they mostly stand and read) would be enough. She said that between homework and drama, she didn\u2019t have time for exercizing. \n\nOur house rule is if you fail a class, you\u2019re pulled from all extra curriculars, no matter your other grades. My wife and I called the school and told them we were pulling my niece from drama and why. \n\nNow her parents are furious. Her mom all but said it was abuse. My brother can\u2019t believe we\u2019d pull her from something she loves so much w/o consulting them, even though when we asked for input on what classes to put her in, they said that we should trust our judgment.\n\nI don\u2019t know. AITA for pulling her out of it?\n\n\nEdit: I was unclear; my apologies. She has failed the class by not meeting this goal. They have officially removed her as of this evening. \n\nBefore anyone jumps on me, I didn\u2019t explain properly. The students can do as they wish with logging the time, as long as they meet each smaller goal.\n\n\nEdit 2: It seems most people think we are assholes, however, those people seem to be overlooking that two credits of PE are required for graduation. This class is not a simple elective which can be forgotten. As such, our punishment stands. She will stay out of drama until next year.  \n\nI am deleting this account as it was a throwaway meant to ask what was, in hindsight, a stupid question.",

    "body": "I have a 18 year old daughter who lives with me. She\u2019s in college so I let her live here rent free. I also have 3 other children who are 11, 6 and 2. My 11 and 18 year old share a bathroom, and the 6, 2 year old and myself use mine.\n\nMy daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we\u2019ve all been sharing mine. \n\nMy 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and I know why. She\u2019s masturbating. It\u2019s uncomfortable but I want her to know her body.\n\nBut she\u2019s been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. I\u2019ve told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don\u2019t need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this I\u2019m going to get rid of it.\n\nThis morning it was once again left on my counter, so I threw it away in the outside trash. \n\nShe stormed into my bedroom while I was getting ready yelling at me about how dare I throw away something she paid for with her own money, and I\u2019m just trying to shame her blah blah blah. \n\nIt was a relatively expensive vibrator, and I do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but I feel like I had to because she wasnt listening.\n\n\nAITA for throwing away my daughters vibrator?\n\nETA: I\u2019m her mom. I\u2019d be fucking mortified if I was her father and I knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. My husband and I are divorced.\n\nETA #2: I thought about hiding it, but I know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. Doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. While yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. She goes to school (which I\u2019m SO PROUD of) and she works part time. Other than that, I care for all her needs. This is my house and my young children and she didn\u2019t respect my boundaries I tried to gently but firmly set the first time. Maybe that makes me the asshole and I will full heartedly accept that.\n\n\nLast edit but I\u2019m fixing the bathroom. I\u2019m not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. This has only been over the course of a week.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole and I think I\u2019m completely justified but I\u2019m not gonna delete the thread because 1) it\u2019s on the front page and 2) there\u2019s some good discussion going on.\n\nAlso, i am 35 years old. I had my eldest daughter at 17. I\u2019m not some old ass boomer. I\u2019m pretty young.",

The reason why they asked for my place is because it\u2019s centrally located to all my family members and it\u2019s a home that\u2019s been in the family for generations (I inherited it) so everybody is familiar with it. \n\nNow I have an old girl, Sierra, and she\u2019s 11 years old. She has arthritis and one *really* bad hip, but she\u2019s a golden so obviously she wants to be right in everybody\u2019s business and see what\u2019s going on even though she can\u2019t really walk around without being in pain anymore. \n\nI got her a really huge armchair from goodwill and it\u2019s basically super wide so she can comfortably sit on it. It\u2019s covered in dog hair and scratches and slobber and she loves it. No one else sits on it apart from her. Now sorry for TMI but I reinforce training my dog to sit in that chair because sometimes she has accidents and I sometimes have pads down on the chair, usually it\u2019s predictable times such as the evening, BUT if I was to move her to the couch where she knows she isn\u2019t allowed for the party that might confuse her. \n\nMy cousin has always been big her entire life but in the last few years she has become very very big. She she needs to use scooters to get around and she has a disabled placard etc. She arrived at the party and after a few moments looking around she decided she wanted my dogs armchair because it\u2019s wide. \n\nI said no that\u2019s sierras armchair, she was currently sitting in it and enjoying the attention everyone was giving her, and I have 3 couches 1 of which was taken up by kids. I said let the kids move to chairs from the dinner table and you can sit on the couch.\n\nBecause the couch is a little lower than the armchair I guess she said no, move your dog. She got rude and pushy, but I was absolutely not moving my in pain old age dog when there\u2019s somewhere for my cousin to sit anyway. I even explained about the puppy pads and she was like just move your fucking dog I\u2019m in pain and can\u2019t stand! \n\nSome family members were strongly in agreement of her, and my mom and grandma were strongly in agreement with me, however it kind of cast a awkward light on the party because she kept loudly cursing at my dog every few moments and waving her arms around to try and scare Sierra off the armchair. Luckily my dog was unimpressed but the whole thing was pretty stressful.",

My parents migrated overseas to where we live now with my sister and had me, completely born in an English speaking environment. I can speak Mandarin, but usually only at home, and I study in a school with English as first language. \n\n\nWe went to my father's hometown in Szechuan Chengdu last month, and welcomed by our grandparents who threw a big reunion party with my uncles aunts and cousins, about 20+ people. They speak in Szechuan dialect as their mother tongue, but are able to understand and speak Mandarin too. While my parents(obviously) and sister(able to understand but can only speak Mandarin) are comfortable with it, I have trouble understanding the dialect.\n\n\nI tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak Mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. That uncle, using Mandarin, told me that I am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. My parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. It was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. \n\n\nSince they were comfortable, I figured I might as well as make myself comfortable too. When an aunt came to speak to me again, I responded in English, this time enjoying her confused face. Even though I had no idea what they were talking about, I spoke English throughout the rest of the party.\n\n\nI had an earful from my parents after that, they said that I was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. My sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. AITA?",

First stop was mine and then his.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. I haven\u2019t disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago I could hear her complaining about how I\u2019m too good to eat what they cook. I let it go.\n\nYesterday, fianc\u00e9 took me around his hometown. On the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. I was tired, so he dropped me off. His parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.\n\nFuture mother-in-law - FMIL: You really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don\u2019t you? You think you can bring drugs into our house?!\n\nMe: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*\n\nFMIL: No no! You stand! How dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!\n\nI reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.\n\nFMIL: I don\u2019t care how legal this stuff is. We don\u2019t allow this garbage in our house! *She pulls out a plastic wrapped package and I immediately know what it is.* My husband took a bite out of it and got sick! \n\nI\u2019m pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! And then she starts going off about how many pills I take (again, wouldn\u2019t know if you hadn\u2019t gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn\u2019t deserve a druggie. She takes my package and shows me where FFIL took a few bites and threw up soon after.\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 minutes and my fianc\u00e9 is back. His mom asks him if he knows all the medication I\u2019m on and how I brought pot into their house. He can\u2019t get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.\n\nFianc\u00e9: Mom, it\u2019s soap. Even says African Black Soap.\n\nHe broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. FMIL fired back saying that she\u2019s never seen soap like that and that this doesn\u2019t explain the amount of meds I take. They say they\u2019re justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it\u2019s their house they can go through personal belongings at will.\n\nI let them have it. I start screaming and cussing because I\u2019m exhausted and tired. I can\u2019t remember everything I said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. FFIL tried to give me back the soap, but I kind of threw it at him saying I didn\u2019t want his gum disease. Terrible, I know.\n\nWe\u2019re staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents.

I wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we\u2019ve always kind of gotten along... now I feel like I fucked up badly.\n\n**TL;DR: future in-laws went through my luggage and mistook soap for an edible.

    "body": "Using a throwaway. \n\nSo, there's a FtM trans guy at my school, let's call him Don (since I'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. He says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. As a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100M. He switched over to the male team. The coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). Don nodded along and said that's okay.\n\nBut the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. Since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. And he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. \n\nI disagree with this, partially. I do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. But he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. I know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. \n\nOne time, after practice when Don was complaining, I civilly shared my opinion. He got offended at this.\n\nAm I TA here?",

    "body": "Hello r/aita. Throwaway for what I hope are obvious reasons. \n\nThis post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. He was raised as the true \"golden child\" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. We were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the \"wrong crowd\" and his life is in absolute shambles. He is 24 now and if I had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor's workshops, investment schemes and on and on. It could be a little less, it could be a lot more. The heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.\n\nMy brother showed back up in Chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was \"voluntary\" homeless. My mom couldn't handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would \"take turns\" hosting my brother so he wouldn't have to be on the streets (my mom's new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can't stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). So when I was told about this and when my \"turn\" first came around I told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, I had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  He wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. I have not seen him since and since I know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, I know he is still using. \n\nWell as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. He showed up at my house on Friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. I told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house OR I would buy him a bus ticket to Florida to get out of the cold. \n\nWell I don't think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket. What I know he thought was happening is that I was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then I would provide for him to come home. When I dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me \"when and how will you send the return ticket?\"  I told him there was no return ticket, take what I was giving him or stay in the cold.  He proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until I kicked him out of my car. I know he got on the bus, beyond that I have no idea what happened to him and I care even less. \n\nedit: he absolutely knew I was giving him a one way ticket. Sorry for the confusion. He just thought this was an open ended party in Florida and I would be sending him a return ticket when he was ready to come home. There was no illusion or subterfuge on my part about the ticket. \n\n\nMy mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for \"great bodily harm\" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she'll introduce her to divorce attorneys. My sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn't sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn't taking my brother in anymore because her fianc\u00e9 was sick of him. \n\n\nSo from the view of my mom, I am not only an asshole, I have apparently put my brother's life in danger. \n\n\nFrom me and my sister's view I have washed our hand's of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n\nedit2: wow this is easily my biggest post ever, by a large margin. I have about 410 unread posts as of this morning. I very much will try to read all of them. \n\nThere's one thing I just want to address really quickly. People are saying \"YTA\" because I blame my dad's heart attack on my brother. Surely you can say that my dad may have had a heart attack sooner or later but he died at 63 years old. Other men on his side of the family have lived well into their 80s and 90s (my Dad's dad is still alive as an example, my two greatgrandfathers lived to 98 and 102 as another example). There is no doubt in my mind that stress of having to deal with my brother absolutely contributed to his poor health. I am no doctor but the links between stress and heart trouble are pretty well established and it got so bad at the end that my dad's own cardiologist  was advising him that he had to let my brother go or it would kill him. My dad died after a series of small heart attacks and \"big one\" that started occurring after he went to somewhere in New Mexico and rescued my brother who was prostituting himself for meth and heroin, all while my parents were sending him something like $3500 a month for living expenses to get himself \"back on track.\" To me the link is so absolute that I feel 100% justified in blaming my brother for my dad's death. You can judge me all you like but the pictures of how my dad changed from a robust man in his late 30s when my brother was born to a broken shell by the time he died would maybe change your judgement.

    "body": "I'm Irish. A decade ago I met Ex. 2 years in I got pregnant. We married, and when our daughter was born he let me pick her name, so I gave her a very Irish name. Fake name I'm using is Saoirse, and the real name is different but similarly Irish and hard to say unless you've heard it already.\n\nEx's mother (MIL) would ring once a week and come to Ireland a few times a year. I always ended up cooking/cleaning for her (she'd stay with us), and when she was on the phone Ex would say \"do you want to speak to OP?\" and I'd have to talk to her. I didn't like this because she hated me, as she was very anti-Irish, and anti-me by extension.\n\nEventually I told Ex that I was done with MIL. He and Saoirse can keep talking to her, but if she calls then don't put me on, and if she comes to visit she can get a hotel and they can go meet her.\n\nA few years ago Ex and I began to have problems. Eventually he asked me for a divorce. The custody agreement we ended up with gave me majority custody, but he gets summer holidays and every other Christmas. He was moving back to England and asked if he could still have contact with Saoirse, so we worked out a schedule for him video calling once a week for 30 mins. He's remarried, his wife is pregnant, and the number of calls from him has been going down, which doesn't surprise me as it's a tricky pregnancy.\n\nAs he's been calling less MIL has been using his skype account to call us in the time slots he isn't using. Because it's a video call on my laptop I can hear everything, including MIL calling Saoirse by the name \"Sue\". I didn't say anything on the call but after I asked Saoirse if that was the first time MIL did that and Saoirse said that MIL gave her an \"English name\" but she didn't like it. I asked some follow ups and found out MIL also corrects her speech when she uses Irish dialect and asks her to tone down her accent.\n\nI was fuming but didn't do anything until the next video chat where I heard MIL call her Sue, and then I asked Saoirse to go wash up, took her seat, and said \"you know her name is Saoirse, right?\" MIL says it's hard to pronounce. I say it's not and break it down to sounds (Sur-sha) for MIL. MIL says the English name is easier, and I say that's no use if it's wrong and told MIL that if I heard MIL call her \"Sue\" or correct her speech again then I'd reconsider this setup.\n\nNext video call was last night, MIL immediately greets her as \"Sue\" I then pop my head in again and say \"I warned you\" before hanging up and blocking Ex's skype account.\n\nI ignored the incoming video calls (she used her skype and her and Ex's facebooks) for the rest of the night. Today I woke up to several messages from Ex saying I shouldn't have hung up on MIL like that and I need to unblock the account, then call MIL and apologise. I had a bit of a moan to my cousin who was on my side until I told her I hung up on MIL and says I should apologise for that only.\n\nAITA?\n\nInfo: MIL has 2 other children in her life, unsure of her relationship to them, but their names are Iona and Lachlan, both of which she pronounces fine, so this really isn't a case of my daughter's name being \"too hard\".\n\nEdit: fuck it. Her name is Roisin (pronounced Row-sheen). She also goes by Rosie. MIL is insisting on calling her Ruby because when my daughter pronounces \"Ruby\" her accent goes funny and sounds more English.",

I'm identifiable because I have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.\n\nThis was on that Nextdoor app so I chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! And got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. Some people told me to go to a gym, why don't I run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. I told them I had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. I'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! And then said that I love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said \"Yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!\"\n\nAnyway I've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that I should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something.

There are no \"trail systems\" or anything like that either. \n\n2 - I don't run the same exact path every day. No matter which street I run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. I have 5 or 6 different routes I'll take. I don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. \n\n3 - I don't have a car, so I can't just drive out somewhere else. \n\n4 - Again, I'm not getting a gym membership. My budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. \n\n5 - I can't run later in the morning. I have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). If I don't leave for the bus at 7:45, I will not get to work on time. \n\nAITA?",

    "body": "Hello! So, I was a bridesmaid in a wedding months ago. The bride was pregnant so we didn\u2019t have a bachelorette party and instead, planned one post baby. The girls Venmo\u2019d me their part. We paid for the bride\u2019s share so she paid zero. \n\nBackstory, there were 5 bridesmaids. One of them, let\u2019s call her Debbie Drama brought her boyfriend as a plus one. He was neither there for the bride or the groom. This wedding was absolutely gorgeous, in a vineyard, open bar, bride and groom paid for the bridal and groomsmen\u2019s hotel for the weekend and a wine tour for us and our plus ones including their family aka BIG MONEY. We got there on a Friday, wedding on Sunday, checkout Monday. Debbie and boyfriend were both there the whole weekend.\n\nWell come wedding day, Debbie\u2019s boyfriend gets everybody\u2019s attention right after bride\u2019s dad made a heartfelt speech, and uses that time to propose to Debbie. TACKY TACKY CRINGE CRINGE. Everyone was shocked and furious, which is obviously justified. B&G have a verbal altercation with Debbie and Debbie\u2019s boyfriend and tell them to check out and leave mid wedding. They\u2019re no longer friends, still. \n\nSo back to the bachelorette weekend. I get a call saying the trip has been cancelled and I\u2019m getting a refund and credits for future use. I forwarded the email to the 5 bridesmaids and bride, so they can read about it. I get a call from the bride furious that I\u2019m giving Debbie her money back and travel credits. I told her I\u2019d be giving Debbie back her money but not credits. She says I shouldn\u2019t give her anything because she ruined her wedding. I technically blame her boyfriend and not Debbie per se but I also never liked Debbie so it\u2019s whatever to me. I told the bride she doesn\u2019t get a say in this because she\u2019s not paying for the trip. The bride almost feels like her and her husband are due the money, although she hasn\u2019t directly asked for it. There\u2019s definitely an implication though. I have no clue what the right thing to do is but I\u2019m going to give Debbie back her money. Does that make me an asshole?\n\np.s. worth it to say, Debbie hasn\u2019t tried to reach out to any of us, or asked me about the trip since the wedding.\n\nEDIT: a couple things worth mentioning. Debbie was not in on the proposal but she is not remorseful. Debbie told the bride and groom that (this isn\u2019t verbatim but close to what she said) \u201cyou guys should be proud and flattered that you got to be apart of my proposal instead of being selfish C*NTS.\u201d After he proposed, she instructed the photog to take pics, then pulled him out into a vineyard thing to take pictures of them as an engagement shoot. The B&G had to pull them aside and tell them how tacky what they were doing was. They argued then they ended up asking them to leave. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth it to note that Debbie is the groom\u2019s step sister. They are not close at all the parents got married when they were adults. Debbie was good friends with the bride in childhood and the bride asked her to be a bridesmaid in good faith since she was marrying her step brother.\n\nAlso, we jokingly said, as penance, we should all show up to Debbie\u2019s wedding in wedding dresses \ud83d\ude02 what do you guys think?\n\n** thank you guys! Money has been returned, all is right with the world. I showed the bride some of this thread and she\u2019s no longer upset about me giving the money back. She realises she overreacted a tad. They all decided to be the bigger people and then cut Debbie and her douche out of their lives. She gave them the photos \ud83d\ude31**",

    "body": "My ex-girlfriend and I had been dating for 4 years but ~6 months ago we broke up \u2014 not on bad terms, but long story short we just both realised that we weren\u2019t heading in the same direction.\n\nShortly after that, she found out she was pregnant. We talked about how we would handle things, and both agreed to JUST be friends and parents to our baby, despite the unexpectedness we both were (and I still am) very excited. We EXPLICITLY agreed platonic parent relationship only.\n\nWe started getting quite close and hanging out a lot again, which I thought nothing of \u2014 after all, we ended on good terms and we were going to be friends and coparents so it made sense.\n\nOne night at my house she tried to kiss and I stopped it in its tracks as I was not comfortable. I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship at all and just wanted to focus on myself and our baby.\n\nShe got quite angry and started shouting at me, asking why I would have a baby with her if I didn\u2019t want to be with her, how could I do this to her, etc.\n\nI just told her I was clear about this from the very beginning, and I asked her to leave and we could talk tomorrow.\n\nThe next day she told me she didn\u2019t want to have a baby out of a relationship and that she was getting an abortion. Unfortunately she found out she was too far along and informed me we would be giving up the baby for adoption. I flat out told her no way I would not let her do that at all \u2014 which is where I might be the asshole.\n\nShe came to my house very angry and again asked how I could do this to her. This is where I might be the asshole (again) because I told her that SHE is the one who CHOSE to have this baby and I was clear about my stance from the beginning. If she misinterpreted my stance or was deluded enough to convince herself otherwise then that was on HER not me.\n\nShe screamed that she was breaking up with me (even though we were already broken up). She talked to my parents and sister and now they are mad at me as they really like my ex and \u201chow can i do this to her\u201d \u2014 and her parents came to my house crying and begging me to give it up for adoption.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have probably been asked 10,000 times how can I do this to her. I told her dad (who had since come to my doorstep ~5 more times) that I\u2019m not doing anything to her, and if he asks me that one more time i\u2019m going to write it on a piece of paper and shove it up his ass, before getting a restraining order (part three of where I might have been the asshole). That was mainly a result of my frustration from being harassed, but I am not trying to excuse it as I know he was just trying to help his daughter.\n\nAt first I thought I was overwhelmingly in the right and that they were the wrong ones, but now everyone has me questioning everything. I know it sucks for her but I genuinely if she didn\u2019t want a baby out of a relationship she should have had an abortion when that was available.\n\nEDIT: i will take full custody but she is not happy with that as it will still technically be her child\n\nEDIT2: she can\u2019t give up parental rights",

I\u2019ve been better about it, but he hasn\u2019t really trusted me to hold anything expensive.\n\nIn the past couple weeks he\u2019s been home alone he\u2019s gotten ridiculously protective.

She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. \nThis whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. \n\nWell, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn\u2019t even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.\n\nFirst thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn\u2019t going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.\n Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren\u2019t compatible, and to just move on with her life.\n\nFast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being \u2018silly\u2019 at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.\n\nNow I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk.

My brother has a girlfriend, also 18, who is over a lot. They are fully consenting adults, therefore they do things that I don't want to think about.\n\nThey always shower/bathe together, and because the bathroom shares a wall with my bedroom and the kitchen, no matter where I go in the flat I hear exactly what they're doing. Then the shower stops running and my brother leaves, and exactly 10 minutes later, often to the exact second, the girlfriend leaves. She spends the 10 minute interim playing games on her phone.\n\nThe reason for this is that she doesn't want me to see them leave the bathroom together. She is unaware of the sound issue and thinks that I have no idea they even entered the bathroom together, and hopes that 10 minutes will be enough for me to believe that my brother had his shower and left and then she entered and had hers separately.\n\nHowever, this 10 minute pause between them finishing in the bathroom and her leaving the bathroom is a real pain in the arse. They always do this either early in the morning when I need to shower and leave for work, or right at the end of the night when I need to do my nighttime routine before bed.\n\nWIBTA if I said to her \"look, I know what you're doing in there, I don't have a problem with it as you're fully consenting adults, but the time you wait between him leaving and you leaving is a real pain, so can you just leave together, or at least shorten the time?\"",

    "body": "EDIT: Thanks y'all! I'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something like this happens again. I've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones, the only thing I feel I need to clarify is that I keep my joking about religious iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. In fact I just avoid talking about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest and dearest are Christians as well. Some of you also got the reference, so thanks for not immediately accusing me of being one of \"those atheists\"! \n\nSo last night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood. During our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. Next week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get our shit together. After her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and from another shift, said, \"After all that we need some good news! I've got some good news for y'all!\" \n\nWhen my manager asked her what the good news was, she said, \"Jesus is coming back!\" Now, I found this pretty annoying, but it has less to do with the fact that I'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*. I'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or assuming everyone around them is a Christian (born and raised in Georgia), so I rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. Plus, my manager responded with, \"Amen,\" along with one of my coworkers. Safe to say there were more people on the older lady's side than mine. \n\nThis is where it gets worse and where I actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. After the meeting, when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations, the older lady came up to me. Only me, from what I saw. She stuck out her hand to give me some Jesus propaganda, and when I tried to refuse (nicely, all I said was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that I needed it. I'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. \n\nI really did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind on the whole \"no point in voicing my opinion\" thing. My husband, who works at the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. \n\nI don't think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she is very much a Christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse T shirts and her lowercase T necklace. My husband says I should bring this up to HR so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with religion in the workplace. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I do? There's a big chance that HR and everyone I work with will think I'm an asshole.",

I already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at \u201cour\u201d place would be limited to when she isn\u2019t there. \n\nI forgot to mention I have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.\n\n**Edit 2**: I agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.\n\n**Update 1: we spoke and this summarized what I said:**\n\n\u201cYesterday doesn\u2019t sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you\u2019re not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. For instance, the few times I eat or cook meat could be done when you aren\u2019t home, I could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there\u2019s a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. Your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, I am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you\u2019re unable to compromise, or unwilling to. This will become a pattern, because you know I want this more than you, and you won\u2019t have to compromise cause I\u2019ll cave to have our family.\n\nYou have a right to state how you feel, as I do. If you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. But the lack of communication about this isn\u2019t going to change anything. I want you and this family, but I\u2019m not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren\u2019t going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. \u201c\n\n**Addition: I feel like I should add this reply I made to a militant vegan here **\n\n~~https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~\n\nI replied to the wrong comment and now I can\u2019t find it.\n\n**Update 2:** All she\u2019s said to me is \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of a future that I won\u2019t have. \u201c not sure what that means but I don\u2019t want to go down any more rabbit holes today. I think I\u2019ll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, I\u2019ll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. Right now I want to think about everything that\u2019s been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what\u2019s best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do I see with her right now.

I believe there\u2019s merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but I don\u2019t believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. I have reading to do..\n\n**thoughts:** I am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that\u2019s causing me to get hate mail, I was referring to a specific subset of vegans, I would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. \n\nI support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. I want the same accommodation. \n\nWas I the asshole here? IMHO Yes in some ways I was. Is she the asshole for the ultimatum? Possibly. What I know for sure is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand how this \u201clifestyle\u201d and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. \n\nSome have called me a pushover, that may be true, but I\u2019m trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.\n\nI am reading most of your comments, and to those who say I\u2019m being intolerant, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m seeking compromise. To those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, I agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn\u2019t happened.",

Last week BIL asked if I would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that I would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. Out of politeness and curiosity, I said sure, thinking I would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.\n\nThe book... is about us. I don't know how else to put it. It's a \"domestic thriller\" (so think *Gone Girl, You,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married \"the wrong sister\" and becomes obsessed with his SIL. It's one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and I don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... Jesus, it's too weird to say. Open a door with me?\n\nHere's how I'm conflicted. People have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. If a stranger handed me this book, I would just say \"not my taste\" and move on. That said, this is my sister's husband, and I found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that I almost didn't finish it. That ALSO said, this is my sister's husband, and I am afraid, based on the past, that if I tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? And on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, I don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (There are no skin suits but you get it.) And if it IS just a fictional fantasy thriller, I'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after Columbine.\n\n**TLDR: My BIL and I dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and I don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**\n\n**EDIT: Whew. Went to dinner and came back to a lot more replies than when I left. I'm figuring out a way to move forward right now. Thanks to everyone who has commented, I've read them all.**",

    "body": "I\u2019m using a throwaway account because I use my main solely in another sub.\n\nI was invited to an old school friend\u2019s wedding that happened a few days ago. We\u2019re not ride or die, but whenever we\u2019re both in the same region we always meet up.\n\nI ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I\u2019d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white. She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I\u2019d been sent in place of a much brighter colour. She said that it looked fine, and she\u2019d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.\n\nOn the day itself, I didn\u2019t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn\u2019t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it. They basically scoffed and said they\u2019d believe me when they saw the \u2018receipts\u2019. I saw them later on in the evening with the bride, and all three of them were giving me the stink eye.\n\nYesterday, the bride posted a thank you message on Facebook, with the comment that \u2018even scene-stealing wannabes\u2019 couldn\u2019t spoil the day. I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn\u2019t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I\u2019d been asked for \u2018receipts\u2019, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don\u2019t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.\n\nI do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn\u2019t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I\u2019ve known for over two decades. The peace-keeping side of me wants to apologise to the bride, but my heart knows she won\u2019t offer the same olive branch, especially now people know she was two-faced in this situation.",

It could never ever cause breathing issues unless she ate an entire punnet, but it can cause hives.\nShe keeps nicking my bath products, shampoo, body butter/scrub, lotions, ect, which are the only thing I really spend out on. I buy my stuff when I need it and most of the remaining money goes untouched.  I usually get a floral or fruit scent like rose or pomegranate but I like strawberry and never buy it because of her allergies.\n\nI've told her multiple times to stop taking my stuff but she still goes into my room and takes it so lately as stuff has been running out I've been replacing it with the exact same thing but the strawberry version.

I started my position making $14 which was more then what the truck loaders were making but once minimum wage increased to $14 my pay didn't increase. I was denied a raise and was told that my position was no more important then theirs. \n\nCurrent issue: I'm taking a week of vacation, my manager Heather aggressively confronted me saying that it was really inconsiderate of me to take that much time off and that it's unprofessional for my position. I told her that I make just as much a loaders and they wouldn't be questioned for using their vacation week. She said that my position is imortant and not as easily filled while I'm gone. I said that I was told otherwise and that if she felt that way then I should be compensated as such. \n\nLater in the day she came back and apologized saying that she's five months pregnant and hormones are making her emotional but that I put her in a very bad spot and that I need reconsider taking my vacation. I told her that she's the one that approved my vacation months ago and if her pregnancy is effecting her behavior and decision making then maybe she shouldn't be in her position. \n\nShe left very uspet and told my coworkers that I said she wasn't fit for her job because she's pregnant and that I was acting all high and mighty asking for a raise. I've got a lot people calling me an asshole and a few agreeing me. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I just got off work and went to Heathers office to apologize but a lead told me she left crying. So Heather told everyone in the office what happened and they took Heather off floor management and scheduling, another manager Alex apologized to me for her behaviour and told me that she was supposed to have someone there for the week I'm off but forgot and tried getting me to rescedual, and that it was inappropriate to do so. Should I still text her and apologize?\n\nUpdate 2: I texted her apologizing for what I said and she apologized for trying to pressure me to cover her mistake. She said she was switching with Alex to office manager until her maternity leave and she feels less stressed by office then floor which I said was good and I wished her the best. Overall I think it ended well.",

They had 3 kids, at the time they were 10, 7, and 2 years old. Me and my husband decided to take them in and last year we finalized the adoption of all three of them (we held off on this for many reasons).\n\nSuffice to say, our family situation is a rough topic.We have worked extremely hard with the two older children and made sure that they knew we were not trying to just replace their parents. But that's not relevant here. This situation involves my youngest niece. Because of how young she was when we brought her in, she sees me and my husband as her parents. We have never lied to her and told her we were her biological mom or dad. And she knows this, but she still has only ever called me mom. Her and my daughter are also only a year apart in age and see each other as sisters. \n\nSo, yesterday the two of them were invited by a neighbor girl to a birthday party. When we were there, I hung out with the other moms as the kids played. This is where Karen comes in. This was the first time I had met Karen. We had begun talking and she asked me about if niece was adopted (my late sister in law was indian while me and my husband are white, this isnt an uncommon question). I answered truthfully and said she was my adopted niece but I see her no differently than my daughter. Karen gave me the normal \"Wow, your so strong/brave/etc\" and we continued on. \n\nAs the party wound down, my daughter and niece came over repeating \"mom\", asking if they could take home some of the extra cake left over. Karen immediately said \"Honney, she's not your mom, she's your aunt\". I immediately looked at her and asked what she meant by this and she said that \"it's not right for me to confuse her\". \n\nMe and Karen got into a fight and it got ugly fast. I called her a dumb cunt in front of her daughter and told her to go fuck herself before I went out to smoke. By the time I came back in Karen had left and the other moms either supported me or told me that I was a huge asshole to pull a scene like that. \n\nWhen I got home and told my husband he said that I over reacted. He agreed that she was a horrible bitch but that I should not have caused a scene and just ignored her. We also had to sit down and explain to my daughter and niece what happened and why I did what I did. \n\nAfter everything though, I feel like I did nothing wrong. AITA?",

    "body": "So I've (29F) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. I don't own it but I've been saving up because I'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.\n\nDuring this time I've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. The latest roommates are a couple, Dan (24M) and Jess (25F).\n\nA few months ago they announced that Jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! I was really surprised because, I feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. I congratulated them but when I asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that I would move out. I said that goes against my plans that I've had for years and that I was planning on staying here. They insisted that I would \"have\" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. I told them that was great and I respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as I was here first.\n\nShit got pretty cold from there. We haven't really talked much, until now. They had the baby and it's now about a month old. I knew I'd have to bunker down a bit so I took all of my things from the common area (TV, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work I got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some DIY soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so I can ignore the baby's crying. They used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which I thought was pretty rude but whatever.\n\nBecause I found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. They want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. I told them that as I said before this wasn't going to happen. Either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way I want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. They said they can't afford to break the lease. I said that's unfortunate but neither can I. They said it would be easier for me because I'm not a parent and that I would just need to scrimp a little bit so I can afford to pay two rents. I said maybe but I'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. I was admittedly kind of the AH for saying this but I was being harassed.\n\nSo my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. It's really miserable for everyone right now and while I don't expect them to drop out of the lease I'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. But I've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out I plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them.",

We don't have a sign up process, you can just show up, write down your name and sit down to share. We make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... It is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.\n\nAt our first August meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call Ashley. There wasn't anything visibly \"wrong\" with Ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (In my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). However, whenever Ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. The first two sessions, I thought it was fine, to each their pace and I didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. Even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.\n\nAt our third meeting, Ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly \"wrong\". She dodged every question I directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... She left quickly when we wrapped up and I couldn't speak with her. Other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.\n\nLast saturday's meeting, I approached Ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. Ashley responded saying we weren't very \"nice\", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some \"mumbojumbo\" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. I was getting pretty angry, and I directly asked her why is it that she was here, and I told her if she couldn't give me an answer I'm afraid I would have to kick her out. She didn't answer so I asked her to leave. \n\nShe contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what I did is not justified, and that I shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma. When I tried to explain that I doubted she had any physical defects to begin with, he shut it down saying I'm being an asshole for judging someone as not \"disabled enough\".\n\nAm I the asshole for kicking her out?",

My mom decided to stay with him at the time, they'd fight constantly, but now, years later, they're divorcing. \n\nI wanted to know and understand more, but my parents wouldn't tell me much. They wanted to keep things between themselves. \n\nSo this year, I reached out to his mistress. I sent her a message on Instagram to say that I know this would sound weird, but I'd like to talk and understand things better.\n\nAnd to my great surprise, I got an answer. She said she could talk, she feels like she owes it to me. \n\nI had to bite back some of the uglier things I impulsively wanted to say, because I was trying to understand, not fight... \n\nI found out the affair started when she was 18 and in college. She signed up for a sugar baby website. She needed money, she had a full ride academic scholarship but money was very tight and her scholarship didn't cover housing over holidays that she needed because her family had kicked her out.\n\nThe arrangement with my dad lasted through freshman and sophomore year. She knew he was married but she felt she didn't have options. She was working food service along with classes and was still barely making it. \n\nShe stopped the arrangement when she landed a summer internship that allowed her to save up. But she couldn't get it out of her head.\n\nShe'd been feeling a lot of guilt, involving our family and her choices. She's gone to therapy and tried to get her life under control since but she can't shake that feeling.\n\nI came into the conversation expecting to hate her through and through. But I realize, I don't. I don't blame her, she was my damn age at the time and trying to make it work. \n\nI felt better having talked and I think she did too. I don't think we'll keep talking or anything but I feel like I have a new understanding of things, and that brings me peace.\n\nSo everything was great for a while until I had a conversation with my brother and admitted I'd talked to my father's sugar baby. He was like \"what, sugar baby?\" And the truth came out. He got angry enough that my dad was spending our families money in that way, that he confronted my dad.\n\nThen my dad confronted me. He was really mad that I'd gone behind his back and met with the girl, he said that this stuff was something he and my mother wanted to keep between the adults only.\n\nI snapped at him and said that if he wanted it to be \"adult business\" he shouldn't have gotten involved with someone young enough to be my classmate. \n\nHe was even madder to hear that...\n\nAITA for meeting with my dad's mistress?\n\n------\n\nETA - \n\nA lot of people in the comments are worried I hurt my mom more by going about things this way.\n\nI didn't mention this earlier because the post was already so long, but I'd talked with my mom a lot prior to this, and she always said she wanted to be open and wanted me to know when I was older / when the divorce proceedings had gone through. \n\nBut she said that it would badly impact her in divorce proceedings if she could be accused of poisoning the children against the other parent. So she said that she didn't want to have this conversation just now, when we were still young and when the divorce is in progress. She wanted it to wait until all of us (me, my big brother, and my little sister) were older.\n\nAfter the events in this post, I talked to my mom again and told her everything. And she just seemed relieved and happy and said \"OK, so now you know.\" And laughed about how we'd be saved an awkward conversation later on.\n\nI'm certian she wasn't hurt or sad that we'd seeked out the truth, I actually got more of the impression that the secrets she felt pressure to keep were weighing on her.",

    "body": "So I (26m) don\u2019t like kids, I never have, and was always adamant that I would never have kids.  So much so that when I was 22 I wanted to get a vasectomy.  The doctor told me to wait and think it over since I was so young, but I eventually got one when I was 24.  It went well, and test results at the time showed I had no sperm count. \n\nMy girlfriend of three years also said she never wanted kids (wanting kids would be a dealbreaker for me) and I thought that was it and we\u2019d be child free.  Well a last week she found out she was pregnant and we were both in shock.  Between my vasectomy and her being on birth control (for non-pregnancy related reasons) the odds of her getting pregnant should be astronomically low.  We couldn\u2019t believe she was pregnant, and my gf assured me she didn\u2019t cheat and was willing to take a dna test to prove it (if that\u2019s possible at this stage) and I believe her.  I also went back to the doctor to get a sperm count, and somehow a small amount of sperm were present and there would be a small chance I could get someone pregnant.  \n\nNow I don\u2019t want the kid, and was under the assumption she didn\u2019t either.  She says she assumed she would get an abortion if she was pregnant, but actually being pregnant is different and she\u2019s having second thoughts.  While I strongly want her to get an abortion, I realize that it\u2019s ultimately her choice, but I told her that if she does go through with the pregnancy (and doesn\u2019t adopt it), I want nothing to do with it.  I\u2019d do whatever I legally have to do in terms of child support, but I won\u2019t be involved with raising the kid.  Also our relationship would effectively be over because I don\u2019t want to be with someone who has a kid.  My friends and brother think I\u2019m a complete asshole and that I should suck it up if she chooses to have the kid.  I think I took reasonable, if not extreme precautions to ensure I never had to worry about a kid and that I shouldn\u2019t have to raise a kid I don\u2019t want as long as I fulfill my legal obligations.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to raise my kid?\n\nEdit: to all the people saying the kid isn\u2019t mine, she offered (unprompted) to take a dna test.  Along with my sperm test results and having no reason to suspect she\u2019d cheat, I fully expect that the child would be mine.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to everyone who has responded.  After further discussion with my gf, she is set on having the baby and is slightly against adoption, but considering it.  She still wants me to be in her life, even if our relationship is over and it\u2019s just as friends.  If she has the baby, I\u2019d treat it the same as I do my friends kids; I\u2019d be friendly towards them but have no interest in raising them, just with the addition of child support. We are planning to get a dna test done as well.",

I'm dealing with menopause at 28 years old, and still deal with a lot of residual lower abdominal pain. This is just my life now. I admit that the chronic pain definitely puts me on edge quite often and I have a lot less patience than I used to have. \n\nNow for how I may be the Asshole; \n\nI had gotten a puppy mid-summer and he was approved to come to work with me after he was 6 months old (got fixed, training, and his vaccines), so he started bussing on my lap with me. Lots of people ask to say hi and stuff, I don't mind. I got him because I decided my life isn't viable for adopting a child (low wages, no time, and I'm single). I had a rough childhood in poverty and refuse to bring another kid into that. Pretty much, the universe is telling me that children just aren't in the cards, and I've accepted this. \n\nAnyways, yesterday I was on my way home from work with my puppy sleeping on my lap. A woman sat next to me and started gushing over him, and then started talking to me. \n\nHer: \"Puppies are excellent practice for children!\" \n\nMe: \"That's nice but I'm not having any.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh never say never! I used to say that too until I popped out 3 beautiful sons!\"\n\nMe: (starting to get really uncomfortable) \"Cool, good for you. Not going to work for me.\"\n\nHer: \"Well you're still young, you better get started now before you miss your window! The clock is ticking!\" \n\nAt this point I was near tears from frustration and said \"Lady I don't HAVE a UTERUS, so I think that window had fucking LONG past.

You have the attitude of an abusive parent.\"\n\nI had had enough and got off at the next stop even though I was several stops away from home, and cried on a bench for a while. \n\nWhen I got home and started venting to a friend, they said that what she said was obviously horrible, but I shouldn't have antagonized her and just moved to a different spot when she wouldn't drop the subject. \n\nAITA?",

She and I pregamed the party at my place too.\n\nWe rolled in a little late, and it was a weird vibe. The girl hosting, Sarah, seemed irritated we were late, which was weird. We went in and everyone was just chilling in the living room with champagne. \n\nSarah was giving out lotion samples like a sales pitch. I mainly just talked to Jess through this about some drama going on in our friend group because I didn't know anyone else there. I'd also opened our whiskey and had poured Jess and I glasses after we drank the champagne. Then Sarah sat down and tried getting the group's attention and got annoyed at us for not paying attention.\n\nShe was making this pitch to sell things, handing out order forms.

And what kinda business is that; it makes like no business sense to get more competitors!\n\nJess was like \"shit I don't know, do you wanna see if we can find another party? So we both went on our phones and started hitting people up, unsuccessfully. We were also still sipping whiskey and were getting steadily more drunk especially compared to everyone else.\n\nWe started talking to a couple other girls there, a lesbian couple, and I was like \"what the hell is this party?\" And they basically said that they didn't expect this coming in but it seemed like some kinda pyramid scheme. And wow could they use a better drink than cheap champagne. \n\nAt that point Jess pulled out our big bottle of whiskey and the four of us started sharing it. They took some shots at first then were just sipping. It was genuinely fun, they were really cool people and were telling us a crazy hilarious story that had us laughing like mad.\n\nThen, Sarah came up to our group and were like \"can you all leave? You've been rude through every part of this\" and Jess went \"look, you invited us for a party! If you want this to be a business thing be upfront about it or else people are gonna show up and party. \n\nSarah told Jess to grow up. She wanted us to go. I asked if we could wait till Uber surge pricing went down and she said no, to get out if we were gonna be disrespectful. The couple we were hanging out with actually left with us to hang out.\n\nJess and the girls we'd made friends with got these angry texts that night saying that we were super disrespectful and unsupportive, and trashy if we couldn't even go one hour to support a friend's business without getting sloppy drunk.\n\nAITA for going to a MLM \"party\" and treating it like a real party?",

    "body": "When I was younger I had a casual sexual relationship with a woman (Sally) I met at a restaurant. We had sex more than 5 times but less than 10 times. I texted Sally on a Friday night, which is when we normally hooked up, asking if she wanted to meet up and she told me to lose her number. I did and later found out she was pregnant. I contacted her again to see if the child was mine. She told me it wasn't and that she would be getting an abortion anyway and once again told me I needed to lose her number. \n\nI moved on. One day I got a message from Sally's mother. She accused me of abandoning her daughter and my son. I told her I had no clue what she was talking about. She informed me that she had been taking care of Sally's son since he was 4 months old because Sally had a drug issue. At this point he was 1.5 years old and she (grandma) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She said she couldn't do it alone anymore. I ended up getting a DNA test and found out I was the dad. His grandmother passed away shortly after I took custody. \n\nHe's 7 now (8 in August) and has been asking about his mom a lot lately. I have always told him that his mom loved him but wasn't able to take care of him. He has accepted that answer until recently and wanted more answers. I decided to be honest. He asked why he had to live with his grandmother before living with me. I told him, \"Your mom and I weren't talking when she was pregnant with you. I didn't know she had you until your grandmother told me. After that I did everything I could to get you.\" He asked if he would ever be able to see his mom again. I said, \"I don't know. I don't even know where she is. She has a sickness called addiction. Sometimes when people are sick like that they make decisions that no one understands. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you though.\" He cried a little and said he hopes his mom gets better. I was gutted and called my mom. She said I shared way too much and hurt him. She said I should have shared much less and stuck with the \"she couldn't take care of you\" line even though he was asking for more.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented, even those who said I was an asshole for the explanation. All perspectives were read and considered. I couldn't and can't respond to every post but trust that I have read them. \n\nThis happened yesterday and he seemed okay today. He didn't say anything about his mother and I am not going to push it. I have always let him lead these conversations. I think I am going to look into therapy and/or support groups for children of parents battling addiction. I will also be looking into resources for myself to help me navigate all of these new situations as they arise. I have no experience with kids other than my own so I may be overestimating my son's ability to understand things and maybe someone can help me work on that. I'm honestly not even sure if his mom is alive. Last I heard she was but that was a while ago. We have a lot to navigate and I could use some help from a professional so I will be looking into that.

Patty is at least 350 pounds and her arms are as wide as watermelons. \n\nSo I had to do her pulse well if you don\u2019t know anything about doing pulse on an extremely obese patient it\u2019s hard to find because there are so many layers of fat. So the teacher and I were trying to find her pulse and we both were struggling. We finally got it and the teacher lost it half way through so I had to start over. I mean this is a teacher with many years of nursing experience who couldn\u2019t find this girls pulse because she was over 350 pounds. \n\nSo I\u2019m on a time limit right. So her arm is too big for the regular blood pressure cuff. So I had to find the thigh cuff that people use on thighs on her arm. Well when you pump them up it\u2019s really hard because of all the resistance so I could hardly pump it up too which gave me a wacky blood pressure reading. \n\nI told the teacher it was unfair that I was partnered with Patty because she was so obese and that I was given an impossible task. I told her that I shouldn\u2019t be out of the program when other people had partners who were a normal weight that they could actually palpitate their pulses. My teacher said that was rude but I think it\u2019s true so AITA?\n\nI just wanted to add that my teacher because she was having problems finding it too gave me a redo and I passed. \n\nI didn\u2019t say it anywhere near Patty I said it in private with the door closed and I did talk to her after and she didn\u2019t know a thing. I told her I failed but it was going to be ok. We hugged it out. \n\nI do feel truly bad for feeling hostile toward her since it was my fault that I failed the first time, no one else. But when I wrote this I was in a bad place emotionally and felt a lot of anger toward everyone. I wasn\u2019t even angry at Patty I was most angry at the situation I was put into and I didn\u2019t think I was going to be able to remediate. So I had no anger toward Patty.

I refill the dishwasher, so when she doesn't do her job I can't do mine (yes, I could just do it myself, and I have, but we pay her to do it, so why should I?) \n\nThis weekend my wife asked her to empty the dishwasher, and take the trash out. She said \"Ok\" then just went up to her room. I went up to her room an hour later, and found her laying in bed watching youtube on her phone (Volleyball videos, nothing important, if anything on youtube could be considered important) I took her phone away, and said \"Your mom asked you to do your chores, not watch videos, please do them so i can do mine\" She said \"Whatever\" and just continued laying there. So I told her if she is not down in 10 minutes I was going to send a picture of myself to all of her friends on snapchat.

I know how important social media is to the kids now a days, so i figured I would try that, and see if anything happened.\n\nI gave her 20 minutes, and still nothing.

I\u2019ve had a complicated pregnancy so I went on an extended leave from work, leaving me at home much of the day. I watch my brother and sister in law\u2019s daughter frequently and free of charge, usually at a last moments notice. \n\nTheir daughter (9) is a very sweet and intelligent girl. She\u2019s very curious and inquisitive to the point of even being nosy and sometimes snarky/judgmental. She will interrupt a conversation between adults to ask a question about the conversation or input her opinion. This can sometimes be frustrating but she\u2019s never reprimanded for it and always obliged. I still had my Christmas tree up on the 3rd of this month and she walked into house without greeting saying \u201cyou\u2019re lazy Auntie, why is your tree up?!\u201d. She\u2019s over heard me paying a bill on the phone and as soon as I hung up she asked \u201cwho was that on the phone? why did you pay your bill late?\u201d.  I grew up kind of old fashioned, I would have been told it was rude to ask those kind of questions and better to stay in a child\u2019s place. My beliefs aside, I always patiently answer her questions and let her wedge herself into my personal business. Yesterday, I caught her watching youtube on her phone, which is strictly a NO NO mandated by her parents, when I asked her why she would do that she said \u201cwell, they watch youtube so I should be able to watch it.\u201d I explained that they were adults and she was a child, therefore they don\u2019t have to abide by the same rules. She doesn\u2019t seem to understand that she is a child and not equal to an adult.\n\nOn to the issue today. At around 8am, her mother texted me asking to watch their daughter at noon because they have a prenatal appointment for an ultrasound and don\u2019t want to leave her sitting in the waiting room for 2 hours. I expressed that I have an appointment with my attorney at 1pm. Her mom said \u201coh it\u2019s fine, you can just let her wait in the waiting room\u201d. I suggested that they allow their daughter to go to the appointment with them and instead of her waiting in the waiting room, she be able to see the ultrasound and hear the baby, ect. My sister in law said she doesn\u2019t want their daughter in the ultrasound room because she will interrupt and just be her normal, snarky self. My appointment is only about an hour or so but I feel like if her parents don\u2019t want to be subjected to her behavior they need to adjust it and not pawn her off on me.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to take her to my appointment?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people saying I and the family are wrong for discounting her inquisitive nature. This is not the case at all. Everyone always answers her questions in depth, no matter how private or personal they are. When she asked why I paid the bill late, I explained about about my leave from work and having to budget differently. Also, her parents have explained that youtube is not always a safe place for children and will be restricted until a certain age. The child believes that if it\u2019s safe enough of her parents, it\u2019s safe enough for her. She doesn\u2019t agree with being protected from youtube. \n\nAlso, she had a half day at school today which is why the babysitting issue came up.",

    "body": "Hi! I\u2019m on a throwaway just in case, can never be too careful!\n\nMe (25f) and my fianc\u00e9 (28m) have been together 6 years and have a little boy who is 2. I am an only child and my fianc\u00e9 has 4 sisters. For context, I\u2019ve never had a strong relationship with any of them (not through lack of trying) They are extremely close and even bought houses next to one another. They kind of have a clique and I\u2019m tolerated I guess, but not really accepted. They have often vocalised indirectly how they prefer fianc\u00e9s ex (who cheated on him) which hurts. I\u2019ve just kind of accepted how life is and try my best to build bridges where I can. \n\nThe problem starts here: for my bachelorette party, we decided to book a weekend away to a hotel in a nearby country. I was super excited as I have never had a \u2018girls trip\u2019. It works out to around $200 each for 3 nights including flights. We booked it a year and a half in advance to give everyone a chance to save. So far there have been no problems with anyone, except for SILs. \n\nThey made comments on the hotel, location, etc despite them being best in the area. Myself and my OH are workingclass and have to save for the wedding. This is our only luxury. His sisters on the other hand are all well-off (married into money) and have multiple trips a year both with and without their kids.\n\nWe agreed and the place was booked. Now, 2 months before the trip, one SIL is insisting on bringing her child (the same age as our son) I refused and have been called a huge asshole for it by all of his sisters. They say she has anxiety over leaving him with her husband who has had him while she has had week long trips before with her friends no problem. She has never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have had anxiety for years and have recently stopped counselling so I understand what it can be like, but I suspect it\u2019s an excuse. She is very self centred and always seeks the limelight (announcing her pregnancy at her friends baby shower etc) and I\u2019ve reached the end of my tether.\n\nOur hotel is adults only. We have excursions booked where children aren\u2019t permitted, have bar crawls planned etc and an adults only spa day. There is absolutely no place for a child, let alone for a 2 year old boy. She expects us to change the hotel last minute to accommodate him. \n\nHe is my nephew and I love him, but this is my ONE thing that I want to be about me. I\u2019ve never had a birthday party, engagement party, baby shower etc. I just want this one trip to be about me, as selfish as I sound. Im getting rude texts and phone calls from everyone telling me it\u2019s wrong to exclude him (even my own son isn\u2019t coming- my fianc\u00e9 has even offered nephew and BIL to stay at our place with them for the weekend too, which she has refused.) \n\nAITA for not wanting him there? I am on the verge of just cancelling the whole thing and all I have done the last few days is cry, it\u2019s getting to the point I don\u2019t want to go at all because I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to make it hell for me either way.\n\nEDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone for your verdicts, whether I\u2019m NTA or not. I never thought this would get even half as much attention as it has. I\u2019m going to put my foot down and bluntly tell them no children, and as others have suggested, say how she will be sorely missed but everything is non refundable and can\u2019t be changed such short notice. If they all drop out then so be it. If I\u2019m an asshole, so be it. I\u2019m only planning on having a bachelorette once in my life and goddamn it I\u2019m going to enjoy it without any regrets. Thanks for giving my head a wobble guys. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to lose sight of yourself when you\u2019re swimming in negativity! Love to you all, even that one guy that called me an asshole.

So now I know that he has been in my room and going through my things. \n\nWhat killed me inside was that she also had a party. Lots of drinking involved. Including my vintage whisky. They cost me around \u00a37000 and were near full. So I demanded that they pay me back. \n\nMy sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. Her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. He is now thinking about breaking up with her over this. Everyone I know is calling me an asshole for demanding they cover my loss. Apparently I should forgive a simple mistake. So AITA?",

He\u2019s been my friend since kindergarten, and we\u2019re tight as hell. He came out as gay when he was 15, and I\u2019m super proud of him and how far he\u2019s come. Okay.\n\nSo we recently met a girl called \u201cSally\u201d. Sally is F20, and she says she\u2019s super supportive of the LGBT+ community and shit like that. She\u2019s closer to Avery than she is to me, but we\u2019re all kinda close, but Avery and I are still closer to each other. \n\nAvery has a boyfriend - \u201cJackson\u201d and they go out and do stuff and like couple stuff and whatever. Jackson is bisexual, and here\u2019s where it gets weird. Last night, while we were all drunk, Sally confided in me that she thinks it\u2019s cool she finally has a a \u201cgay bestie\u201d and that it\u2019s super sexy when Avery and Jackson make out, and she\u2019s touched herself thinking of that. She also told me that since Jackson is bi, she wants to have a threesome with him and Avery, and maybe make Avery realise \u201cgirls aren\u2019t all that bad.\u201d\n\nImo that\u2019s pretty fucked up.

Fuck, it\u2019s creepy if it\u2019s straight to me.\n\nEDIT II: Okay, so I messaged her an hour ago, and her sentiment hasn\u2019t changed, but she did try and laugh it off.

    "body": "My (f28) roommate (f28) of 4 years has been dating a girl (f25) for a few months now. They've asked me many times if her girlfriend can bring her emotional support dogs over (edit: one is an emotional support dog and the other is a licensed therapy dog, neither are service animals) because they're essential to her girlfriend's mental health. I said I understand they're important to her girlfriend, but that I'm not comfortable having dogs in the house, due to both allergic reactions and anxiety that I feel regarding pets in the house (I didn't grow up around animals). I have said I'm not okay with dogs from day 1 of living together. \n\nEvery spring, I cough nonstop from February to May from allergies. It's been getting worse and worse this season, and so a month ago, I went to the doctor and found out I actually have allergy-induced asthma. My doctor gave me two different inhalers and a bunch of other medication, and told me to be careful around pets during this season and especially what is tracked onto my carpet because I was wheezing so much. Literally cough attacks throughout the day everyday, trouble breathing, missing work, trying to stay indoors as much as possible to avoid allergens.\n\nI told my roommate about this and the dog topic didn't come up again. Then I found yesterday that they brought the dogs over anyway when I wasn't home because my roommate was sick and her girlfriend brought her food and medicine. My roommate said the dogs would be in her room the whole time. I said I was unhappy because fur/dander does get everywhere through clothes/feet, and asked that she at least vacuum after the dogs leave. After getting home, I went to get something from my car, but I guess they thought I left for the evening, because when I came back a few minutes later, the dogs were roaming freely through the house.\n\nI opened my front door to find them in the kitchen, and they barked when I came in and freaked me out since it wasn't something I was expecting in my house (I'll admit I am a little afraid of dogs - I blame it on my immigrant upbringing lol).\n\nI said I thought it was inconsiderate that something was brought into my home that makes me uncomfortable and feel unwell. My roommate got mad at me for making this a \"huge deal\" when they were only in there \"for a good 10 seconds\" (edit: in the kitchen for 10 seconds before retreating to the bedroom) and making her girlfriend feel bad (I don't know why her gf would bring them in the first place then when she already knows how I feel). Girlfriend and dogs left immediately after.\n\nMy roommate previously said it's hard to be at her girlfriend's house instead because her girlfriend has horses and my roommate is allergic to them (edit: she said she might be allergic to the hay or other things around the house due to the horses, and the dogs in our house shouldn't be a problem since they'll stay in her room the whole time). Ironic?\n\nAlso I'm moving out-of-state in 3 weeks, so I was thinking they would just wait it out...instead of creating conflict last minute after so many harmonious years. This also makes me wonder if they've been sneaking the dogs in for a while without my knowledge, and if that's why my allergies have been worse this year than any other year. Home should be a sanctuary! \n\nTldr: am I the asshole for not wanting my roommate's girlfriend to bring dogs over against my wishes because of the medical and psychological impacts on me and my level of comfort in my own home where I pay to live?",

My meal was $63 (She told me to get it.) and I only had $20 on my card as that's all I had for the rest of the two weeks. When we went to pay, she paid for her and her partners meal and not mine. I stood there and whispered I couldn't pay and she started saying well I need to pay its the law. I was stunned because I explicitly told her I couldn't afford it and reminded her she said she'd pay. She said she said that when she was drunk and Everyone should always carry money even If someone offers to pay. Her partner ended up paying but on the car ride home she belittled me and embarrassed me and her partner even had to say Thats enough and for her to stop. She said I was spoiled and entitled.

    "body": "\nA couple weeks ago though I saved up for a weighted blanket because I thought it would be a lot easier to deal with and it totally was. Now I just use that blanket along with my regular comforter and sheet set. Now while I absolutely love it, I don\u2019t need it to sleep.\n\nLast week I (17) got roped into watching my niece (5) over night because my sister had to work and our mom had plans. My niece has autism which causes her to have tantrums every now and then which is why I don\u2019t often watch her, but sometimes I have to because my sister (23) can\u2019t always afford or find a sitter, which is why she still lives with our mom. In case its not clear we\u2019re actually half sisters and half the time I them the other half I live with my dad and step mom.\n\nSo my niece had a really hard time going to sleep. Like it was almost midnight and she was all over the place. Which is not uncommon, but I was really tired myself and just wanted to go to sleep. So I thought why not try and use the blanket on her because thats kind of what they\u2019re made for. Well it worked pretty well and calmed her down and she soon fell asleep. I was a little annoyed though that I didn\u2019t have my blanket to use anymore. \n\nThe next morning my sister found her with the blanket and we got to talking about them. I told her how well it worked. She didn\u2019t really believe me so I let her use another night. My sister was very pleased by the results. So, over throughout the week when my niece had two really bad tantrums my sister asked if she could use the blanket. I said yes because she just looked so exhausted herself.\n\nWhen she looked into buying one she became reluctant because my niece only likes very specific things my sister doesn\u2019t want to get her another one that she may not like since I don\u2019t remember which brand I got. She is short on cash so she doesn\u2019t want to have to buy multiples because honestly they can get rather expensive. I know mine was over $100 because I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t have to deal with the beads spilling out issues that a lot of the cheaper ones have. I\n\nWell, when I went back to my dads the other night I brought my blanket with me. My sister calls me late one night completely frazzled and asks where I left my blanket because niece just wont calm down. When I told her I had it with me at my dads she was upset. Not at me, just at the situation she had to deal with.\n\nNow I\u2019m supposed to go back to my moms today and I don\u2019t really want to bring blanket back over there or at least sneaking it over there and saying I left it at my dad. I\u2019m tired of not getting to use it whenever I want and also I just don\u2019t want to share it because something about a sharing blanket all the time feels gross to me.\n\nUPDATE: Several people have informed me that it is very dangerous for a child to use an adult size weighted blanket, so I guess the whole thing doesn\u2019t matter now. I\u2019ll just help my sister find a kid sized one.\n\nAlso sorry about calling the meltdowns she was having tantrums. Still learning about correct terminology.\n\nThanks for all the suggestions for places to get blankets guys, but I think everyone already named everyplace that exists. The amount of comments is getting a little insane for me so I\u2019m gonna sign off now. Thanks again.",

I said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option I'm considering. \n\nI love her massively, I don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. I've promised her i will look after her and I'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to GTFO, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... \n\nSecondly, when my SO and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. \n\nthirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/\n\nfinally I would like to thank all of you.

We use them for all meals at home.  \n\nWe also do things like having water at most meals, although we also have a cabinet overflowing with different kinds of tea.

If we have sweets, they are homemade and are usually things such as black bean brownies or oatmeal crumble in place of cobbler.\n\nWe do not make our children workout, but my wife and I do so in our living room, so they see us and grow up with the idea of it being normal.

It cost me around $90 which deffo isn\u2019t chump change cos I\u2019m a semi-broke university student.\n\nSo we were over at her parent\u2019s and she accidentally flushed it down the kitchen sink. Don\u2019t ask me how, I wasn\u2019t next to her. Her father took apart the piping underneath and managed to shake it out which was really good. She & I were both relieved. But over the past week she\u2019s lost it *three more times*. Every time it went down our bathroom sink & I\u2019d have to take a not insignificant amount of time to take apart the plumbing (which is nasty in its own right) and get it out. I asked her how in Jesus\u2019 name she keeps losing it and she says that when she does a toner scrub (pours toner on a cotton pad & scrubs her face) she accidentally rips it out. Now look. I used to have a stud so I know how easy it can be to lose it but I always made sure to watch it when I was washing my face. All it takes is a bit of effort really.\n\nSo this morning she wakes me up and tells me that she\u2019s flushed it down the god damn sink AGAIN. Obviously I\u2019m really annoyed at this point. As I\u2019m taking apart the plumbing once again, I tell her that this is the last time I\u2019m doing this and that she better watch me so she knows how to do it in case she loses it again. She says fine, okay, whatever. I find it and it\u2019s all good. \n\nGuess what happened an hour ago? Yep, she flushed it down the sink. For. The. Sixth. Time. And I say, look. I told you I\u2019m not going to do it again. I didn\u2019t say I told you so, or you\u2019re being dumb, or anything like that. I said that that sucks but I am not going to take it apart again. Like, she\u2019s got hands too. She\u2019s seen me do it so many times by now she should know how to do it.\n\nShe got frustrated with me and said I\u2019ve done it so many times so why not do it again. That made me laugh because if she really wanted me to do it then that would\u2019ve been the worst possible thing to say. She asked me to call a plumber I said no I can\u2019t afford that. She then threatened to call her dad to do it and I laughed again, like am I supposed to be scared of that? lol\n\nShe\u2019s just been crying really hard now & I feel bad about refusing to do it. Should I just suck it up and do it anyways?",

We've been together 10+ with 7 of them married so naturally we've discussed all things baby, family, etc.  One of the things that has come up before is the day of our little ones arrival.  I've stated in no uncertain terms that I believe the only ones in the delivery room outside of medical professionals should be her and I.  My wife however, has expressed that she'd like her mother to be in the room.  We haven't discussed this in some time and definitely not since finding out we're expecting, but I do anticipate the topic coming around again soon.\n\nI take issue with my MIL being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of IVF) I'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  I'm not saying she shouldn't be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - I'm fine with all of that.  But when it comes time for the main event so to speak, I feel it's time for her to head to the waiting room.  I want this time alone with my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle for everyone else.\n\nI've learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so I'm not entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  So I'm wondering AITA if I stick to my guns on this one, or am I better off taking one for the team, sucking it up and letting my MIL (in my opinion) ruin the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit: forgot to mention that barring any unforeseen circumstances she'll be having a planned c-section, so unless the kid arrives unexpectedly we won't be doing hours of labor, etc.",

    "body": "\n\nTwo years ago, a good friend of mine miscarried her daughter at around 18 weeks. It was a terrible time for her, and it broke her a bit. She chose to deal with it by starting an Instagram where she documents her loss, and for a while that helped. She started to referred to her as having been \u201cborn sleeping\u201d, which is baffling to me (I believe that you shouldn\u2019t sugar coat grief/death) but I figured that whatever gets her through the next year was fine, and I did my best to be supportive.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s become her identity. She always talks about it, her \u201cjourney\u201d, and her \u201cangel baby in heaven\u201d. Hardly anything else! She even threw a birthday party twice for her daughter.  With a cake and candles!!! The first one I understood, but with the second one....felt ghoulish. I\u2019ve experienced miscarriages (one at 14 weeks, another fairly early on) myself, and while it sucked, it was no great cataclysm, and I got over it rather quickly. I understand not everyone is like this, and that everyone heals on their own timeline, but I think that something is very wrong.\n\nHer house has turned into a shrine for the daughter. Her hospital pictures are EVERYWHERE, and her nursery remains untouched. I would totally just let it go as harmless eccentricity except for the fact that she has a five year old son. He\u2019s such a great kid, but it\u2019s become clear that he is less of a priority to her than her grief. He appears on her social media, but never as like \u201cjust her son\u201d, it\u2019s always as \u201cher brother\u201d being graveside, holding the body in the hospital, posed next to a bigger picture of her face, etc. He\u2019s become more of a prop than a person. \n\nSometimes she\u2019ll post pictures on her phone of the daughter  (she has SO many from that day, the funeral, etc), while the son tugs at her, begging her to play, and she will ignore him. It\u2019s like she cares more about someone who never even lived than the boy she watched grow up. Her husband works a lot, and she is a SAHM, so while he does his best with the son, but you can tell that the son needs his mom.\n\nLast week, she called me in tears because the son had destroyed some of the framed photos of his sister, and she had found him \u201cdestroying the nursery\u201d. She said that she punished him, and told me she had no idea why he would disrespect his sister like that. I told her that \u201cyou would probably lose it too if you felt like you were competing with a ghost\u201d, and that her obsession with her daughter is delusional, unhealthy and endangering her relationship with her VERY alive son. She lost it at me, saying I couldn\u2019t possibly understand how she feels, etc. I told her that she needs to accept that her daughter died, and work through it. I urged her to get treatment, or to at least have her son see someone because her neglectful actions are setting him up for psychological damage.  She hung up on me, and though I\u2019ve tried to call her back, she refuses to take my calls. \n\nAITA?",

    "body": "This one needs a little background. I (40sF) have two younger brothers. We were raised in a very conservative Christian home (think early evangelical movement). My brother \u201cSam\u201d was pretty obviously gay, but he had a lot of shame and forced himself to marry a woman from church. They had my niece (now 19F). Unfortunately, my brother made some bad choices, and he developed a drug habit which caused him to OD when my niece was four. Our parents are now deceased, and my other brother is career military and gone a lot. I\u2019ve done the best of my siblings, and I have a well paying job and plenty of savings. I have no children.\n\nBecause of these circumstances, we (my SIL, niece, brother, and I) are a very close knit family. I\u2019ve always helped my SIL financially here and there, and I\u2019m paying my niece\u2019s tuition at a state university. She\u2019s a good student, and I\u2019m happy to relieve the burden on her mom.\n\nThe problem: my niece is getting involved with a pretty conservative Christian group on campus. She was not raised religious, and I\u2019m an atheist, but I respect that some people find religion meaningful and enriching. However, I feel like she\u2019s been adopting homophobic and sexist attitudes (e.g. \u201ccomplementarity\u201d of the sexes), and I think it\u2019s coming from the group. She also opposes marriage equality now, on the grounds of religious freedom. This could just be a teen rebellion thing, but she doesn\u2019t know her dad was gay. I can imagine how much he\u2019d hurt if he were alive.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to argue it out with her, but she always deflects. Now, I\u2019m considering pulling her spring tuition in order to make my point. I don\u2019t want her going to university if it\u2019s making her a crueler, more ignorant person. That\u2019s not the purpose of education. \n\nAITA?",

My mom was a SAHM her entire life. When I turned 12 (I was the youngest) my dad lost his job during the financial downturn and we really struggled. My mom could have worked, but didn\u2019t, even though my brothers and I were all in school. \n\nMy dad never got as high paying of a job subsequently but my mom never cut down on her spending and never got a job. I distinctly remember coming home for college and seeing my dad break down over bills because they were heavily in debt at this time. My mom still never worked and would resort to very bullshit, borderline sexist answers as to why she wouldn\u2019t (ie \u201cI gave him 3 kids. The least he could do is support us.\u201d) \n\n3 years ago my dad passed away because of a largely stress/lifestyle induced heart attack. My mom encouraged him to move 6 hours away to work a high pressure job in a new city to try to earn more money. Between never seeing his family, living in a tiny apartment, and getting terrible sleep because of his hours, he died alone and we never got to say goodbye. The worst part is I found out recently my mom didn\u2019t allow him to fly home as frequently as he liked to \u201csave money.\u201d I suspect he was heavily depressed the last few months of his life.\n\nStarting last year my mom started begging my brothers and I for money because she has no job and no source of income obviously. My brothers send money home every month but I refuse to. I tell her she could do ANYTHING to support herself, she\u2019s only 52, but she very pitifully asks me if I want to see her bagging groceries. \n\nMy brothers think I need to contribute because she\u2019s mom and she\u2019s just how she is.

At the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. \n\n1. He didn't feel that our income was high enough. He demanded to see financial records. He wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. Both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. He also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. \n\n2. He felt that I and his brother needed to get therapy for \"being different\". Along this line, he wanted his brother to \"act more normal\". We would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and \"not be a heathen\". \n\nI was furious when I received this. HE COULD HAVE JUST SAID NO. That he acted like the sole way for us to have children and like he could control our lives is ridiculous. I don't want to adopt BECAUSE I don't want to have a third party telling me what my standards are. I'd rather be childless.

She also rarely speaks to us directly and kind of uses Paul as a sock puppet to tell us things. When she does speak to us directly, it's usually to call us out on something.

This was the first time I ever felt like a full family unit and not the bad kid who fought with my step mom was just wasn't the nicest to my step sister. I thank them so much for not holding a grudge when I went through my teen rebel phase. I hugged them both goodbye and went home, I feel like me giving them a shot and going to my dad's place helped me realize that these are the people who have always been there for me. I mean they were the ones who didn't give up on me when I was a troubled teen and I love them both for it. I text my step sister almost daily now even if its just a good morning or I have the day off and I call my step mom a bit too now but it goes a bit deeper and I've started to really trust her like a mom.  \n\nThank you all for the advice and to not cut them out cause it really did help me realize that we ARE a family.  We have been since I was 8 and I love and care for both of them very much.\n\nEdit:I posted this same update on r/relationships so that\u2019s why it looks familiar",

    "body": "I got permission from the moderators to update and I wanted to share what happened. \n\nHere is the original if you didn\u2019t see it yesterday:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/apiwrd/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_off_my_airsoft_team/\n\n\nSince people had things tonight we agreed to meet over lunch and all but 3 people agreed to show up, even among the people that quit outright. So including me 16. I got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see Madison sitting there. So that made it 17 people. The guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened Sunday, he would do the talking. This really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback I got here and didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nThey started off by having Madison say her thing. I have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. But basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn\u2019t want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn\u2019t judge her for her looks. I was like sure, whatever you think but come on. Anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. She asked me if I would please consider if I she could stay on the team. \n\nI was totally on the spot so I was just started out by saying that I was sorry and I overreacted. But then I said I think it\u2019s best if I step down because it was obvious I take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. But as long as I was still doing it, I was happy to have her back. \n\nSo that lifted a huge weight in the room. So we got into more business and it turns out that the reason Madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her \u201cinsta-fame\u201d to get our team sponsored. She said the reason she didn\u2019t tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn\u2019t want to let us down if they fell through. So she\u2019s still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in March we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. She is starting an airsoft specific Instagram and she expects it will take off and she\u2019ll get deals for the team. I\u2019m literally blown away by her generosity and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make some income from it, but she\u2019s choosing to share with us after the way I treated her. \n\nBut anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that\u2019s going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how I managed the team for tournaments so I\u2019ll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  We also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and Madison (or anyone I guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.\n\nSo that is where we are. Team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. Madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but I guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings. It\u2019s weird but i guess I can stand to update my world view. ",

You're answers were overwhelmingly positive (save for a few), and today I finally solidified my position and pulled the trigger. \n\nFirst the good - When I returned home, I searched the box that I had hid the pictures and scrapbook to find that they were gone. Upon inquiring of their whereabouts, I was directed under a bathroom sink. There I found the remains of the scrapbook, mostly put back together. However, I realized that at least 2 pages were missing. I also noticed that a few pictures in question weren't present. Upon questioning, I was directed to a trash can, where I found a couple torn pictures. Still, to my dismay, I found that the contents of the ravaged scrapbook were still incomplete. Further investigation revealed another stash of torn pictures. Finally, I have attained all of the pictures. (Shout out to the private messages offering to reconstruct them. A massive thanks to you!)\n\nTwo more days passed and I demanded that she apologize to my daughter for destroying the scrapbook (which now resides in my daughters room). Apology accepted, now comes the hard part. \n\nI wont bother lying to you all, for I fear you would see through me. I considered trying to work through it. I thought, perhaps her efforts to repair the scrapbook are worthy of forgiveness? \n\nNAY!\n\nSeriously guys. I cant thank you enough. If it weren't for your guidance, I would probably continue to expose my daughter to this woman. Our relationship has ended, and I am now focused solely on raising my beautiful baby girl and my career.\n\nEdit 1 - Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aht3zd/aita_for_not_throwing_away_pictures_of_my_exwife/?utm_source=reddit-android",

She didn't really treat me well when I was a kid, always called me names and she basically despised me so much, despite us barely seeing each other. So we've always had a rough and strained relationship.\n\nSo I hosted a family gathering at my house, mainly because it's been a while and partially to try and at least mend things since she **is** my aunt at the end of the day. So everyone arrived and things were going smoothly. Let's skip to the AITA part.\n\nMy 3 year old son was playing around with his cousins in the garden under my supervision. You know, usual toddler things (running around recklessly, chasing each other). My son in particular was being loud but I didn't really mind. My aunt kept on telling them to shut up and I told her that they're kids and they're playing around, no need to tell them to shut up. This went back and forth for a bit and eventually I had my way.\n\nMy son then tripped on a rock and fell on the ground face first, causing his top lip to bleed. I picked him up and brought him and the other kids inside and told them that play time is over. While I was attending to him, my aunt, out of frustration, then comes up with this:\n\nA: Serves him right. He won't be so loud and annoying next time.\n\nI turned around and said \"You what?\" and she repeated herself like it was completely OK to say that and said that this incident will serve as a good lesson for him. That done it. I told her to get the f**k out of my house and that me kicking her out will \"serve as a good lesson\" for her not to say shit like that again. Eyes were now facing my direction.\n\nShe was baffled and had nothing else to say. To my surprise, she left without saying a single word. My family was shocked and not long after, everyone started leaving. The last to leave were my parents who, while on their way out, said that I let my emotions get the better of me and I shouldn't have immediately kicked her out like that.\n\nIt's not like I have a wife/girlfriend to talk to about this, because I'm a single father.

I don't think they hated each other or anything like that. Honestly, I think the divorce had more to do with it. Because of reasons I won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. \n\nAnyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. Right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and I asked him \"what about \\[son's name\\]\" and he paused and he said \"he doesn't get anything either\". Honestly, I was shocked, but I was pretty much grieving at this point so I didn't question it. \n\nWell, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. He said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. The items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (I still have it) and a blue button up shirt (I don't know which one specifically, but I still have all of his old clothes). I responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely \"I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for responding.\" and that was it. \n\nAbout a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that I'm basically preventing him from moving on. I didn't respond and I blocked her email and I haven't heard anything since. \n\nI've been feeling sick ever since this happened. I'm still trying to move on from his passing and I'm not trying to stop him from moving on, I'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but I feel like I've done the wrong thing and I don't know how to handle this. \n\nWas she right?

I saw my now cat Zuzu, I didn\u2019t go up to her at first because I knew I\u2019d fall in love with her. So my foresight didn\u2019t save me and I learnt she had been abandoned since late Jan 2019. It was then May, so she had been there for +/-5 months. I spoke with the manager and he said he\u2019d phone the owner and see if they\u2019d get back to him and he told me to wait a week. So I did, I confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. They never did. \n\nSo it\u2019s now a about month in an I post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. It\u2019s a small town. She sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. I explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. She never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when I firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and I would provide her with a lovely home. She hasn\u2019t responded yet and I did apologize to her in the messages. It\u2019s weird I know where she lives and works, it\u2019s one of the nice bars in town. She\u2019s a sweet person but,\n\nI just feel bad. I understand cat love. I understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? How long is that even in cat time? \n\nI\u2019m conflicted but feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing. I thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. I gathered supplies and made what I couldn\u2019t afford. I love that fluffy stinkball, but how do I manage this relationship in a small town? Do I ignore it? I just don\u2019t know how not to be the asshole here...\n\nEdit: \nAbandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. Left there after being put into boarding,\n\nThe local SPCA does have a boarding facility but on weekly fee basis. She (Zuzu was left there for way over that time) and the owner was contacted before my attempts after filing for adoption.  \n\nThanks guys, I really appreciate that a lot of people get why I feel so bad but also firm on the decision. \n\nThere\u2019s some photos of Zuzu on my profile for anyone asking as well.

I didn\u2019t mention that he and I have started dating. I didn\u2019t want to tell them about us dating because I didn\u2019t want anyone making jokes or teasing us about it.

I was **SO** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable.

A few years ago Grace invited Adam and Rose to come back and live with her, saying she now had the time/money to take care of them. She ended up spoiling the boys but said that Rose, who had hit puberty, was a \"woman\" because of this and was expected to take on the same role Grace had, so Rose ended up basically being a live in nanny to her brothers.\n\nIt was our birthday yesterday, and we always have family dinner with our parents, spouses, and children, at our parent's home.\n\nAt one point Rose excuses herself, heads for the bathroom, and about 10 seconds later we hear her say \"what the FUCK\".

I'm not going to sit here and say they've never done anything wrong. But they know better than to draw on walls.\n\nGrace then gets angry, saying that I am implying that she didn't raise her kids properly and how dare I accuse her children.\n\nI say that Rose is great kid, but her sons have a history of doing stuff just like this. The drawing is too high up to be my kids, which leaves her boys to be the likely suspects.\n\nGrace then says it has to be one of my \"brats\" who did it because she raised all of her children better than that.\n\nIn anger, I say \"you didn't fucking raise them!\"\n\nShe gets quiet, collects her kids, and leaves. Rose refuses and stays with us. I end up cleaning up the mess on the wall and Jacob tells me that he saw David in the arts and crafts box. My parents want me to apologise to keep peace and Rose says that while she gets where I'm coming from, she's getting calls from her mum saying she needs to come home and complaining about me, so until I apologise Rose is dealing with it.

She is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if I want anything [I will give her $$$]. \n\nWhen I ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. We have gotten into arguments because she will see I am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if I am okay. \n\nI need to get away from the kids sometimes. I have asked her to watch the kids while I get milk from the store. She says she will pick up the milk for me. When I tell her I need a minute alone, she says the offer is \u201cI get the milk or nothing.\u201d \n\nI am drowning in debt, I have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. I just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. I am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful\u2014which I don\u2019t want to be. But I feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. \n\nOur dad has a pool in the back. She swims laps every morning. It was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. I had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. She said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. So she didn\u2019t have time. I would desperately like some help. \n\nConclusion\u2014\n\nWe both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. Thanks for the help\n\n-- \u201cHoward\u201d and \u201cRene.\u201d",

    "body": "Over a year ago the microwave at my office died. The company refused to replace it. They said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. This would take a long time. \n\nI wasn't having that. At the time I went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. Initially I kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. So I moved it to the office kitchen. \n\nEveryone who saw it at my desk is gone. It's just been \"the microwave\". Anyway, my wife and I bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. Our new home is close enough to the office that I can commute home during lunch. So I took my microwave home. Generally speaking I close the office and I'm the last one here. I took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. \n\nA lot of my peers are FURIOUS I \"stole\" my own microwave. Even the company owner and my manager are upset saying I snuck it out at the end of the day or that if I bought it for the office it should stay here. That was never my intention. I never communicated it , but I always meant to take my microwave home with me. It's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. I dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. Five bucks each or something. I said that and again more angry reactions. \n\nThe screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. Saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and WE should buy another one. I'm not willing to budge here. It feels foolish that I should donate my personal property because people expect me to. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the input on this one. I guess I was honestly an asshole here. I didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but I think I was also stuck on the \"mine\" like a toddler. This is a bad situation for everyone. I'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.\n\nEdit 2 : Just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. It was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. BUT since then it's a lot of new faces. Not justifying anything. Just providing more context to my actions.\n\nEdit 3:\nObligatory \"this blew up way more than I expected!\"\n\n A lot of people seem to be asking \"why doesn't your boss provide one\". I work in an insurance agency. We spend little time in office as possible. Especially the agents and financial advisors. The owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. She says that's how it was when she came into the business. Not a position I exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. At some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. Not justifying it. Just sharing. \n\nRight now I've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. Most people took the apology in stride. A few are angry for the sake of it. Planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. A few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. Just wanted to add this.\n\nFinal update : Met with my boss. It was a very mixed bag. I read a lot of comments on and off today. I decided to throw some weight around. Telling her how much I've earned her what I've done. I basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. I told her she created this situation. I told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. I asked her why I shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. \n\nShe didn't like that. She told me this is EXACTLY why she doesn't like appliances in the office. If it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. We sort of went back and forth with this for a while. My boss asked me how would I like it if she went to my home and demanded I bring something in. She disclosed her annual salary. It's very similar to what I make. I called that bluff and asked about business profits. Told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. \n\nNegotiations broke down. At some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. She ended the conversation telling my boss \"quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home.\" \n\nI feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. That woman is a SAINT. But I suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.\n\nEdit whatever electric boogaloo: turns out at least one of my colleagues found this since it hit the front page. So that's... fun? But seriously y'all, posting \"quit immediately and now\". That's a bit drastic. I have a lot of gripes. But I plan on sticking with my job for a few years for experience. That's a funny thing you see on reddit a lot people say \"quit right the fuck now\". But like, people have houses/bills/etc. I have a daughter. This is the real world. You have to dance to that fiddle sometimes.",

She follows a lot of family accounts on Instagram she would once in a while send me videos of kids and say \u201clol this is totally our future kid) \n\nI was very adamant  that I wanted to wait until we could afford a house, pay off some debts and establish our careers  before getting married and then we would have kids. She just finished her masters and I finished physiotherapist school and would love to start my own physiotherapy business in the future. She always agreed that we weren\u2019t ready for kids but it was obvious she had intense baby fever. My girlfriend is on birth control and takes the depo provera shot every 3 months. \n\n3 days ago my girlfriend tells me that she\u2019s 2 months pregnant and she just found out. I was absolutely shocked. Honestly I suggested an abortion at this point but my girlfriend was adamant against it and said she was pretty excited for the baby and was mad I was even suggesting abortion. \n\nSo honestly,  I did accuse her of intentionally getting pregnant because it honestly just made the most sense.

When the person finished, I was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, \"Hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?\" The butcher said \"yes\" and was about to follow her when I interjected, \"Sir, I was here first.\" I swear I saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.\n\nMoving on. I had a cart full of groceries and I stood in line to check out. There was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so I waited a few feet behind her because had I moved my cart forward, I would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. Then, I see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. I told her, \"Excuse me, ma'am, I've been waiting here. I'm next in line.\" She gave me a smug look and said, \"Ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??\" So I told her, \"Because I don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but I AM NEXT.\"\n\nGuys, she continued to argue with me saying, \"Well....you should've moved forward\" and then CONTINUED to unload her groceries. Keep in mind that I am not a confrontational person. In my 44 years on this planet, I have never been in a fist fight, In fact, I used to be a major pushover. If I was 18, I may have told her, \"You're right, go ahead.\" Well, that's not what happened.\n\nI. SAW. RED. I YELLED at her, \"Listen lady, I'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration, UNLIKE YOU who probably doesn't give a shit would've blocked this entire area. Now put your things back into your cart NOW or I'm going to go over there and do it for you!\" Then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, \"Seriously? You need to move because she HAS been waiting.\" You'd think that she would have backed off? Nope. She continued to unload her groceries muttering that I should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.\n\nI yelled, \"I'm NOT going to tell you again. Get your shit and put it back into your basket or I'll go and do it myself. NOW.\" She then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. I would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the Exorcist. I can't remember the last time I've felt so angry.\n\nShe finally moved but she kept staring me down and I'm ashamed to tell you guys that I screamed \"WHAT THE F\\*\\*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT????????\" She finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. The nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how I defended myself but to please calm down because I looked like I was about to pass out.\n\nI need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  Only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  I know....  No excuses.\n\nTo be honest, at this point in my life, I've let people walk all over me.

Believe me, if you guys knew how to speak Spanish, I would've written the exact exchange I had with this entitled twit in Spanish. I don't know why but when arguments happen in Spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!\n\nEDIT:  I'm getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because I assumed that there wasn't a single person here that could speak or read in Spanish.  I know a lot of you can so  I translated this story into Spanish so it's somewhere within this thread.\n\nTL;DR: A lady cut line in front of me twice and I lost my marbles.",

    "body": "Repost for rule violation. I have about 45 mins to decide.\n\nI'm the mother of a 9 year old autistic boy. His birthday was yesterday. His school has an invite all policy and I want him to make friends so his entire class (30 kids) was there.\n\nI didn't find out until the day of the party but due to his school's invite all policy he had to invite a couple kids who had been giving him a hard time over his autism.\n\nWhen I got the RSVPs I called the mums and basically said \"so your kid has a problem with my kid. Here's what my son told me. Can you talk to your kid before the party because I don't want my son upset on his birthday.\" Of the 3 mothers, 2 said \"oh my god I'm so sorry I'll talk to my kid ASAP\" but the third went full \"well my child is a perfect angel. You probably meant someone else.\" but I didn't back down and she agreed to talk to him.\n\nDay of the party. Less than 30 minutes in I see the three kids talking to my son. The one with the defensive mum is doing all the talking while the other 2 stand there and watch. I wait and watch in case their mums talked to them and this is an apology. Then my son bursts into tears.\n\nI go over to the parents who'd stayed behind and said if any of them are the parents of those 3 then take your kid and leave. This was not in front of the kids. 2 left immediately and said their kids are getting grounded, and the defensive mum also left but not before calling my son a r\\*tard and saying her kid didn't want to come anyway.\n\nCut to today, around break time at my son's school I get a call from his teacher. She wants to talk about yesterday. I'm expecting something like the other mum wants to set up a meeting to talk about what happened. But that would be too easy. The teacher instead reminds me about the invite all policy and how the idea is to stop kids feeling excluded and I kicked out 3 kids. Over the phone I tell her that they were bullying my kid. She says \"and you as an adult felt the appropriate response was to bully them?\" I responded that as they reduced my son to tears I felt it was appropriate to ask them to leave. Teacher then says not to be surprised when my son is excluded from something.\n\nI'm about to go pick my son up from school. The headteacher has office hours for parents right before pick up. A solid 50% of me wants to go in there and ask why the fuck these kids were allowed to bully my son but he still has to include them and the other half of me is saying I need to calm down. I'm a teacher too, in a sixth form, so we don't have the invite all rule but I've still had to deal with my fair share of entitled parents, however if I spoke to any parent like that I'd be out of a job, so I am genuinely unsure about my next move.\n\nWIBTA if I gave the head an earful over the kids and the teacher?\n\nUpdate: I talked to the headteacher. I kept my cool. He said that what she'd said was unacceptable and he'd talk to her and I have a meeting with him, the teacher and the mother of the other boy and deal with this.",

    "body": "I (30F) am a white American woman. My ex-boyfriend, the father of my daughter (30M) is Chinese-American. We began dating our junior year of college, and after graduation moved in together. We eventually got serious enough to consider marriage, and I began learning Chinese as a way of connecting to his culture and family. I'm not totally fluent, but I can hold fairly complex conversations. \n\nWhen we were 25, I found out I was pregnant (oopsie). He wanted me to get an abortion, but I ultimately decided to keep my child. I was uncomfortable with termination, and was in a solid enough financial position to support a kid, with a good foundation of emotional support from my parents. But he told me that he wasn't interested in being a father. Personally, I'm of the belief that if a woman can unilaterally decide to abort, a man can decide not be uninvolved with his child's life. We broke up, and while it was heartbreaking and very difficult, it was the best move for both of us \u2013 we were no longer on compatible paths. Though he doesn't have custody, he does sometimes visit his daughter.  \n\nSomething I was very cognizant of, once I realized that I was going to be single-parenting, was that I was going to be a white mother with a child of color, raising her with very little contact with her Chinese family. I know that many children in this scenario can struggle with cultural identity, and I wanted to do what I could to ensure that my daughter isn't totally disconnected from her Chinese roots. I made sure to keep up my Chinese language skills, learned to cook Chinese dishes, and \u2013 when my daughter was born \u2013 made sure to take her to Chinese cultural events and things like that. \n\nI've been attempting to raise my daughter with some skill in Chinese language. I speak to her in Chinese, watch Chinese TV with her, and have recently started giving her some kiddy workbooks in Chinese language. \n\nLast time her father visited, though, he was very upset to see those workbooks in my home. He told me that Chinese culture isn't mine to impart on my daughter, and that any form of Chinese culture I try to engage in with my daughter will be completely unauthentic. He said that, though DNA-wise my daughter is Chinese, she functionally has no real cultural connection to China, and that it's super cringey of me to try. He told me to stop, and that it should be his decision, as it's his culture.\n\nI told him no. I don't think he's really thinking about what's best for our daughter. But I also recognize that it's his culture, not mine, so maybe I should listen to him?\n\nIdk. AITA?",

Honestly, she wasn\u2019t very helpful and said I should just keep working as usual/try to ignore him. I think they went and talked to him though, because immediately after my meeting he started avoiding me.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThis was until two weeks ago, when I gave my notice.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThey decided that Louis should be my replacement, despite having absolutely no experience in my department. Which means I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks training him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no other way to describe the experience except as \u201cHell on Earth\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s too much creepiness to even write about; he\u2019s engaged in full creep mode this whole time. Making all sorts of inappropriate comments. Touching me whenever gets the chance and literally sitting an inch away from me. And he doesn\u2019t take notes or anything about how to do the job. He just stares at me and tries to make conversation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nYou remember the office when Toby touches Pam\u2019s knee? That happened the other day. When we were sitting at my desk and I was training him. He straight up touched my knee and held his hand on it as he was telling me how proud he was of me. It made me so uncomfortable I got up and walked away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nI tried talking to HR about it. Since I gave my notice, they\u2019ve no interest in dealing with it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nYesterday was my last day and I will never have to see Louis again. I\u2019m so grateful for that, and for all of you for the advice I\u2019ve been given.\n\n\n\nEdit: I've been asked a few times why I stayed and went through with the training.\n\n\nMy company gives out our yearly bonus at the beginning of September. They said they would still give it to me if I agreed to stay and train.\n\n\nI'm quitting my job to go back to school so I was very financially motivated to just deal with it.\n\nEdit 2: I've got a few more questions so here it goes.\n\nI've already received the bonus/my final paycheck. Everything is in order.\n\nI won't name the company because I dont want this story coming back to me. I already think I've posted too much.",

    "body": "I am 23/F. My parents \\[both 47\\] divorced 18 years ago. In those 18 years my dad has had a steady flow of *young* girlfriends and fianc\u00e9s moving in with him. I never even got to spend the night with him when I was a kid because there was always some girl living there and there wasn\u2019t room for me in his small apartment.\n\nOn the polar end of the spectrum is my mom. I do not think she has even been on a date since the divorce, until a few months ago. Her whole life revolved around providing for and entertaining me. A few months ago (4ish?) she told me she was seeing somebody named \u201cScott\u201d and that it was kind of serious. I have *never* seen my mom look giddy before \u2013 it warmed my heart. She then tells me that he is 68 (her dad\u2019s age), and to not freak out, but that if I was weirded out, she would call it off. I assured her that while I think it\u2019s kind of weird that he is 2 decades older, that I am ecstatic for her. (I AM! This woman deserves it.) She cried happy tears, and we agreed that I would meet him soon. \n\nWell, around the same time my mom started dating Scott, my dad got a new gf named \u201cHaley.\u201d She has already moved in with him, and I have been refusing to meet her. The reason *why* I don\u2019t want to meet her is what makes me an asshole... It\u2019s because of her age! She is one year **younger** than me. He is 47, and she is 22. I\u2019m completely grossed out. Honestly, it makes me feel like my dad is a huge creep. \n\nMy dad keeps pointing out how I\u2019m a hypocrite because I\u2019ll meet my mom\u2019s \u201ccreepy boyfriend,\u201d but not *his* girlfriend. And he will say, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m creepy for dating somebody 20 years younger than me, then why are you okay with Scott doing it??\u201d He made me feel kind of shitty.\n\nI mean, he is right\u2026 the age gap is almost the same\u2026 but his girlfriend is YOUNGER THAN ME. She is 22. Scott might be old enough to be my mom\u2019s dad\u2026 but my mom is almost 50, she\u2019s not still in college. And my mom is *far* from na\u00efve. Dad's relationship just seems so much ickier to me!! Honestly, I'm starting to look back on my dad's relationship patterns and wonder if he's not like a predator or something. But if he is, then is Scott too??\n\nI am 100% going to meet Scott, and unless y\u2019all convince me otherwise, I am not going to meet Haley. (It's nothing against her)\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

    "body": "On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I\u2019ve put $7,500 into my wife\u2019s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I\u2019m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I\u2019ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.\n\nWell yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I\u2019m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying \u201cinstead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt\u201d.\n\nI told her that I\u2019d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she\u2019s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. \n\nI told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn\u2019t want to \u201cmiss out on the prestige\u201d (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.\n\nShe\u2019s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it\u2019s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.\n\nI told her that he\u2019d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.\n\nI thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to \u201cpersuade\u201d me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I\u2019m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.\n\nNow I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they\u2019re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?\n\nEDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though.",

    "body": "My younger sister (30F) has been dating \"Jerry\" for 3 years. He's a loud-mouth who holds ignorant, bigoted, and homophobic views. I have no clue what my sister sees in him as no one in my family shares his perceptions. Here's what the first Thanksgiving was like with him (he was meeting my family for the first time). he brought up the recent election and called me a \"snowflake\" because he knew I didn't vote for Trump ( I guess my sister told him since I didn't know him before this.) He went on about how awesome Trump was and how awesome this country is now going to be. I didn't engage because I thought he was  foolish, how he had no idea who my parents voted for and still thought it was appropriate to run his mouth nonstop at the dinner table the first time meeting all of us. After more than two hours of this, my mother finally asked him to change the subject. \n\nFast forward to now. He has, on more than one occasion, brought up that if his kids \"ever decide they are \\[insert vulgar word for gay here that begins with an F\\]\" that he'll disown them, and other awful things along the same lines. I'm the only one that pushes back, usually asking him why he'd say that, which usually fires him up even more. There's no having a respectful conversation with him. My sister just jokes and laugh it off every time he says something blatantly racist or ignorant. My parents cringe and try to change the subject. \n\nThe final straw came when he went on social media and made comments about my relationship. He tried to call out my boyfriend and me because we both have good careers and split household expenses. He thinks this is wrong because \"you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be nickel and diming each other like you\u2019re just roommates, what's wrong with you two? Doesn't he take care of you?\" Which is hilarious because he's in his 30's, he moved in with my sister who pays for everything after two weeks of dating, only works part-time by choice and has no savings whatsoever. \n\nI blocked him and called my mother. I vented to her that I don't appreciate any of misogynistic/bigoted/homophobic views and he's a loser. My mom agreed with me but said she wishes we could all get along. My boyfriend and I live a plane ride away and I told her I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving this year if he was. I said because they, meaning my parents and sister, just sit there while he talks, that that makes them complicit to the hateful commentary and I don't want to be associated with someone like him. My mom was understandably upset and said I was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. My dad is sick about this and wants everyone to shut up and get along. I feel I have reached my limit, but some of my extended family members feel like I should just suck it up since it would really crush my parents since I live far away if I didn't see them on a holiday. \n\nWIBTA if I didn't come to Thanksgiving at my parents?",
