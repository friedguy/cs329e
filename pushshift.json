I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\n\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\n\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\n\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\n\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?",

    "selftext": "I'm likely going to get some flak for arguing with someone over the phone, but the fact that I couldn't speak with her face-to-face was actually the reason this whole thing happened in the first place. \n\n  This former friend of mine often met with me for lunch or coffee or whatever every so often, and we'd make a day of it, as we lived in towns roughly 100 miles apart. To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. \n\n  Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. \n\n Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. \n\n  So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. \n   \n  I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion:\n\n* **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. \n\n*Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.*\n\n**Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems too. Also, you did stuff wrong too, and you seem more interested in yourself than anyone, despite you calling me a friend**\n\n*Her response: Well this is all your fault, you seem to think your whole life is dependent on me. Just go and do whatever you want, I don't care.*\n\n**Text 3 (final text)**: Surprise, surprise, it's my fault. Act like an adult, not a kid, and actually realise that you're not the centre of my life, and that you're acting like it's the end of the world because I actually want to know what's happening in my life, bearing in mind you're expecting me to spend good money on petrol and food. \n\n  This prompted a long, rambling phonecall (which I ignored for the most part) about how she 'wasn't friends with me any more' and how she hated me. Since then I haven't heard a word from her. \n\n  So, who is the asshole in this situation?\n\n",

This is the longest time that I have spent at their house in the past three and a half years for a slew of reasons. I usually only come home for a few days around holidays and then ship off back to school. I did not want to spend this much time at home, my parents basically bribed me back by paying my rent and bills for the month of February and March. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or unappreciative, I really appreciate their help, but I have been completely financially independent for the past three years and that is the way that I like it. I don't mind providing for myself and being responsible for myself financially, I actually prefer it because I don't feel obligated to other people. However, my parents were extremely adamant about me spending some time at home over my break. They don't fully understand my reasonings for taking this semester off and think that it's because I am unstable or something, which is untrue I simply needed a break like many students. Anyways, I've been here and been absolutely miserable. I hate the job that I'm working here and absolutely prefer the one at school. I don't have many friends here so I've been incredibly bored. Lastly, I have been fighting nonstop with my parents and just don't get along with my dad at all. Every conversation we have blows up into an unproportional argument involving tons of shit from the past and I end up saying really terrible things and feeling like a piece of shit. I try to avoid anything other than meaningless remarks about the t.v. show we're watching or how food tastes so this doesn't happen because I feel terrible constantly arguing with him when I'm in his home and he's paying for all of my stuff. But he keeps prying at things and me until I ultimately end up saying things that I really regret and feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit.

Am I the asshole or were they?\n\nOk, so, I've lived with the same five people for three years now. In the second year, I and one of the guys I was living with got together. Let's call him John. So me and John got together in the second year of us all being together, that was all great.\n\nCome September, all five of us move out of that house and into another. However, this house has slightly smaller bedrooms, and out of five, only two have double beds.\n\nThis is where I begin to wonder who is being the asshole. One of our housemates took one of the three single rooms, fair play. But the other two, (both single, don't ever bring anyone back on a night out, basically only ever sleep alone in their beds) decide they want the double rooms.\n\nThis pissed me off a bit because, if I was living with a couple and there were limited single beds, it wouldn't even be a question for me- one of them should have a double bed. Because they naturally will share a bed every night. What couple wants to go to seperate single beds every night?\n\nSo long story short-ish, we ended up drawing names out of a hat, and lo and behold, the two single people get the double bedrooms. I hoped someone would be big enough to offer me or John one, but no.\n\nSo me and John now share one tiny bedroom which we ended up putting two mattresses on the floor and sleeping on that.\n\nSo, sorry it's so long but...

I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think.\n\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\n\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\n\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \n\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.\n\n**tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn'd, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same.",

Then I made a comment about how me and my friend, E, have been best friends since 4th grade. She calls me out, and starts asking questions like \"what is hid favorite ___\" and it actually made me really uncomfortable that I didn't know most of this. I've been friends with him for years but we would always talk about other subjects and never got to know the favorites of each other.\n\nBut I digress, let's move on to when it gets worse...\n\nHe comes out with fireworks that detonate when you throw them. My truck was parked right next to where we all were. Its been in perfect condition for the past 8 years, and she thought it would be funny to start throwing the fireworks at [my truck (costs 40k, 2005 GMC SLT)](http://i.imgur.com/vCcIWV5.jpg). I told her to stop, and she kept going. I told her that I like to take care of my shit and don't want someone to come along and fuck up what I worked on for 8 years. She laughs and throws more. Then she takes the wrapper and stuffs it in a hole in the trunk for towing straps.\n\nWe all agreed to go out to a place. Everyone piles in another guys car, but when my friends gets in my car his GF jumps in and almost scuffs up my leather seats. Then she proceeds to take the lighter and \"playfully\" hit me along the drive. This is when I yelled at her. \"I've already fucking told you, Im trying to keep this vehicle in a good condition and everything you're doing is ruining 8 years of fucking work. Respect my shit or get the fuck out!\" He (he's a joker) sarcastically said \"hey man, apologize to her for that\" and he and I laughed nervously, then she started hitting me and said, yeah, apologize!\" Fortunately, we just pulled into the parking lot, and as soon as they got out my truck, I drove out of the parking lot, frustrated.\n\nI got home about an hour ago and still thinking about this. There's scuff marks all over the passenger side of my vehicle now, and I feel like a butthurt kid for getting so angry about it, but I try to take care of my shit. I'm not sure if my friend is seriously pissed at me for this.\n\n\nEdit: turns out he wasn't being sarcastic. He thinks I should seriously apologize for slapping his GF on the hand when she kept hitting me.",

The filter I bought was from a very well respected manufacturer (Katadyn if anyone is interested) but this specific model had some major design flaws. I sent in my filter because it had failed after a short time and got a brand new unit in return. Because I didn't really trust this filter anymore, I got one from a different brand and sold the exchanged one on a small trekking forum. That was years ago and I kind of forgot all about it. Until I stumbled upon a travel report where someone has trouble with his water filter and eventually he and his friend become sick and have to cancel their trip. He wrote that he bought the filter on the forums, so I checked and it was in fact the filter that I had sold to him...\n\nSo now I feel like an asshole because I knew the filter was shit and I still sold it. On the other hand, it was a brand new unit from a respected manufacturer that is still sold at most commercial outdoor stores.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

    "selftext": "Recently I spent a good amount of time traveling around New Zealand. I had a tiny budget, so I was getting around by hitch hiking and sleeping in my tent most nights. One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. \n\nHe was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, \"It's too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns.\" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. \n\nI stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don't mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation.\n\nThe next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days.\n\nDay 3, while we're driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn't pushing to do so myself. His reasoning is that I should be spending whatever money I am saving by not staying in a hostel on things that we can enjoy. He frequently hosts couch surfers, and says that is standard practice when somebody provides you with a place to stay. But I actually spent more money traveling with him than I would have without. And it seemed unfair to expect we should each contribute equally, because I had almost no money and he had kept bragging about how much money he was making from each of his speaking engagements. This pretty much spelled the end of traveling together for me, and I hitched another ride while he was in one of his speaking engagements. He never responded to my message when I told him what I was doing. \n\nEver since I've been worrying about this general situation. I'm very stingy with what I allow myself to buy. So I'm also not usually buying stuff that I share with other people. But when other people offer to share with me, I will often take it. I think I'm kind of a free loader. Where's the line where being frugal for myself becomes obnoxious to those around me?",

    "selftext": "So, I live in a college neighborhood. I was just leaving my apartment to go to the grocery store, and I get to a \"T\" in the road. The other car, a pretty new-looking silver Audi, is driving down the straight part. I'll admit I wasn't 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't look to see the driver's face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn't happy. I thought \"Oh well, at least it's over. What's the worst that could happen, he follows me?\" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.)\n\nFast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn't recognize. He starts to say, \"Next time, learn how to drive!\"\n\nI immediately realized who it was, and I said, \"You followed me here...?!\"\n\n\"Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car. I live at--I actually work at [apartment complex], and I just don't wanna see people around there driving like that.\"\n\n\"I'm really sorry...what do you want me to say? Nothing happened. I'll admit I wasn't paying full attention. I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say.\"\n\nAt this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's people like this who are the reason why I don't like to leave my apartment often. I told my roomies about it later, and we wondered, how far would he have followed me? What if I was driving to the other side of town? This happened a couple days ago, and I've been terrified of running into him again ever since. \n\nIn my opinion, if you're so worried about your fancy car being damaged, don't bring it to a college neighborhood full of inexperienced drivers.\n",

Just within the last week or so, her hold on my psyche has been broken, and I'm speaking more freely around her now that I'm not quite so worried about what she thinks about me. It seems like all she talks about is her exes (plural) lately. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, but up until now I didn't want to say anything.\n\nThe other day we're having coffee, and it's a friendly conversation, but she starts spiraling around the same topic (her difficulties telling whether she's attracted to men as opposed to women). I tell her that she's really driving this topic into the ground, and that she's been saying the same thing over and over for ten minutes. She says that she doesn't act like an asshole when I do it (I didn't realize that I did, and I'm not sure if I do). I immediately apologize for my insensitive comment. We sit in silence for a moment, and she leaves as I sit in stunned silence asking myself what had just happened. It turned a complete 180 from friendly to hostile in a split second.\n\nI realize that this was probably something important to her to talk about, but I don't think I realized the degree to which it was. I definitely could have said something in a more delicate way or just suffered through the awkwardness inside myself (which I have done on more occasions than I can count for her), but I don't think that her tantrum was an appropriate response either.",

    "selftext": "  Some background first which is relevant. \n\n  I've always been considered the most academic of the family and so things like good grades and school performance reports weren't a negotiation, I was expected to work hard and get them. Even when I did, I was rarely given praise for it, other than a short 'well done' or 'good'. Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. \n  \n  Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased. He just seemed content to sit on his bum, collect his unemployment money and just generally laze his life away. Any attempt to speak with him about going to college and getting some qualifications (I wasn't the one speaking to him to clarify.) or about applying for work was met with 'dunno' or 'I'm looking at a course' or 'I'm speaking to a mate' or some other lazy excuse. \n  \n  So skip forward to two weeks ago and a family member mentions that she's heard from someone she knows that there is this job going which my cousin should be 'perfect' to do. Stuff happens, calls get made and abraadabra, my cousin gets the job, no effort required on his part.\n\n  Now part of the problem I have with the whole thing is that the same help wasn't exactly forthcoming when it came to my own jobsearching, and if anything I was made to feel quite a shitty, horrible failure of a human being by my family for it. There were times when things devolved into screaming matches (not instigated by myself for the most part) because of it. \n\n Rather it was the situation that it was down to my effort, despite my family, to find jobs, to post CVs to companies, to secure interviews and then to finally secure the job I now have. All of it was because I put in real effort and actually did something. \n\n  Another part of me also feels resentment because I know that my cousin isn't the person my family thinks he is. They think he's this wonderful innocent kid, and that he's somehow on a pedestal because he'll do a few odd jobs for them now and again. Yet I've seen the other side of him for myself and I know he's just playing the goodie two-shoes act so he'll get the praise (and money/favours) from them. \n\n So, am I being an asshole or not here?",

I didn't get the plate number. I figure they're in there smoking shit or something. Didn't look thugish. I call security. Just to let them know what happened. They show up with the cops in tow. They go into the house, find all the sliding doors and windows open and close them.\n\nThis afternoon I see an SUV parked at the same spot. I get suspicious. I peek over the fence and yep, there's a window and a sliding door open. Security says call the cops this time. I come out to wait for the cops and there's the black Camaro with 2 young males in it, just idling by the curb one house down from the vacant one. They drive off. 3 cruisers show up. I explain it's not THAT big a deal, I just want a report filed. Report gets written up. I get a copy.\n\nAITA for making a fuzz about some kids going into the house next door to smoke some weed?

So I have been hanging out with this girl exclusively with another guy who is a senior(18) I had asked her before we hung out the first time to go to a movie with me and about a month later to my birthday which was also a movie. She said yes to both of these and then about a day before said something like Oh sorry I have &lt;some excuse&gt; I'm so sorry I can't go.

Even if this is meant to be satirical I don't find it funny and have had to deal with this in order to hang out with her. I texted her one day that I wanted to get lunch with her on&lt;day&gt; and what she thought, she responded no less than 5 mins later saying how much fun we'd have and how she'd love to go(some additional info: we had a school performance(8-10:30AM) that morning followed by the banquet that following afternoon(6-12PM)) I said I'd meet her or pick her up to go to the restaurant at 12. We get to that morning and we are talking about it and she still confirms that we are going to have so much fun and it's going to be great. So the performance ends and we both leave agreeing to go. \n\nI text her to be sure she's arriving at the restaurant at 12(it was 11:30) she says she feels bad for not inviting him(the senior) and says we should hang out another time. \n\nI told her if he was a good friend he'd understand. She then text something along these lines,\" &lt;My name&gt; it's &lt;his name&gt; I don't understand and don't think you two should go.\" \n\nI call up the senior and ask hims whats up he says he has no idea what I'm talking about and says he doesn't care if we go.\n\nI tell her this she says \"There are plenty of other times we could go with the senior.\"\n\nAt this point I was done with the bullshit.\n \nI told her that \"If you don't like me to just tell me to my face instead of pretending\"\n\nTo which she said,\"DON'T SAY THAT\" \n\nI reply with,\"Then stop acting like it. &lt;his name&gt; doesn't care you shouldn't feel bad.\"\n\nShe replies that \"it isn't a big deal\"\n\nTo which I say, \"It was to me I've had a really bad week(my phone was stolen the day before) and was really looking forward to this\"\n\nI then inform her of the other 2 times she has blown me off. I said I didn't care those times but this was the third time.\n\nAfter she tells me I'm overreacting I reply, \"You know what maybe I am, I'll make you a deal if you make plans with me for another date(as in time) and follow through I'll completely forgive you. Without &lt;senior&gt; or anyone else.\" \n\nShe has yet to reply and completely ignored me at the banquet. I feel really terrible even though I'm pretty sure I was absolutely justified to be upset. I've only got opinions from people I know so I feel they're a little biased. Also should I try to make up with the girl or just not try until she apologizes. Being on bad terms with her is probably a bad option because she will be in my group next year and senior would have graduated plus my best friend in the group is quitting and my 2nd best is graduating. \n\n**TL;DR Girl I like blows me off for 3rd time, I get upset and tell her off, she gets upset at me, I feel bad**\n\nUPDATE: First of all thanks for all the wonderful responses. Second I like to mention that I talked to her during school today told her I was in the wrong and apologized she then said that it was completely reasonable and she was sorry. I could tell she didn't mean that but I appreciated the attempt. I'm just going to stay friends with her and I'll just try my luck with some one else.",

It implies that every problem that ever happens could have been easily prevented by the most blitheringly obvious and well-known efforts.\n\nExamples: \n\n* If I have a back injury don't tell me \"You should always bend your knees when you pick something up.\" ...Especially if there is no indication that I did this by bending from the waist.  \n\n* If I temporarily lose my keys don't tell me I should have a spot to hang them or a usual place to put them every day.  (I do this, but distractions happen.)\n\n* If you see me eating a huge piece of cake, don't tell me it's fattening.   I know.\n\n* If I tell you I can't find any info on something, don't tell me to \"try Google\".   I did.  \n\n* If my shoes come untied, and I trip on them, it's not necessary to tell me I should keep my shoes tied.

    "selftext": "For simplicity's sake we'll just say I'm an atheist. I'm not militant about it at all but I have severe issues with organized religion and since I want absolutely nothing to do with their faith (varying severities of Christianity), family gatherings are always difficult.\n\nOne point of contention is that I refuse to hold hands with them while they pray before they eat. I don't really want to go into detail about how I feel about it but suffice it to say that thanking god for your meal and other creature comforts is offensive to me. I try to be polite about it but they all instinctively grab my hands and there's not exactly a nice way to tell a family member to take their hands of you. Hell, if I had my wont to do, I'd stay out of the room until they were done eating but they make a big deal out of all of us sitting down to eat at the same time. \n\nRecently I made an exception for my grandma because she thinks she witnessed a kid being molested/groped outside of a pharmacy. I had taken her to pick up her prescription and just to do a little shopping. I led her out to my car and got her situated before realizing I forgot my change (my grandma likes to chit chat with the cashiers and we all got caught up). I ran back inside and had to wait a bit so the cashier could open up the register again. When I came back out my grandma was seriously freaking out about it and she asked me to pray with her that the kid would be alright. (I looked into it, notified the police as to what my grandma thought she saw and long story short it was just a very short woman and her husband)\n\nMy grandma told my entire family about how I comforted her and prayed with her. She knows Im not religious and that I rejected christianity more than a decade ago and I still remind her every holiday that I don't pray but I didn't have the heart to not hold her hand in that situation.\n\nA couple of my relatives took that as a \"Well I guess Kry's finally found Jesus\" and they started pushing it on me again pretty hard. I got plenty of \"see it's not that hard to just hold hands, you don't have to even really pray\". They just couldn't understand why I'd still refuse to hold hands. \n\nI got pretty ticked and told them me holding hands while they prayed was like them holding hands with a bunch of people worshiping Satan. Needless to say that didn't go over well and a lot of my relatives are not speaking with me right now.\n\nSo... Am I the assshole?\n\nEDIT:Just as a clarification (and I know nobody said that I was but) I'm not just being an obstinate child by refusing to hold hands. I feel very strongly about the subject. \n\nI'll try to condense a long ugly story but my mom kicked me out when I was 19 over an argument that started because I told my younger (I'm the oldest of three children) siblings that they didn't have to pray if they didn't want to. I started refusing to go church when I was 12. I didn't even have a good reason back then but something inside me resisted everything they were telling me and when I finally got around to reading the Bible that cemented my distaste. I never actively tried to sway my little brother and sister because they adore me \"Anything Kry says has to be true\". I wanted them to come to their own conclusion but I obviously couldn't hide that I didn't believe what the rest of the family believed. I was past 18 so she was under no obligation to support me anymore but it still hurt to have my mother tell me I wasn't welcome in her home as long as I was poisoning the minds of her other children. \n\nI don't mean to offend people here but the idea and the act of prayer sickens me and I will not be a part of it. But I do realize what it means to them and in this case comparing them to satanists kinda does make me an asshole \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We already had a history of not being super nice to each other, as I see her bossing my roommate around all the time (none of my business I know) but this day pushed her to almost full out hatred of me.  We had a table for over ten people and they are sitting across from me.  The meal goes fine until we get the bill.  The waitress hands out pens for the receipts since we all payed by card.  We all get similar pens except for her, she gets one of the nicest pens I have ever seen.  This thing had heft and mass, and wrote like a dream (I borrowed it after she used it to sign my receipt). It looked almost exactly like [this](http://static1.jetpens.com/images/a/000/006/6234.jpg).  As we are about to leave she starts talking to her sister about taking the pen.  I overhear this and mention that they shouldn't take the pen, they in no way need it and the waitress is just working to support herself.  I work part time at a restaurant and see first-hand how hard waitstaff works and see how in their stressful job how something small can push them emotionally.  My buddy's girl snaps at me right away saying, \"My mom would think it's just fine\" in the the absolute rudest way possible.  Not wanting to get into family business or anything I do not mention her comment, but do ask her to picture herself as the waitress paying for bills, school, etc with this job.  In the same tone as before she quick retorts, \"My dad would would take it too.\"  At this point, I'm ready to leave and I see her stashing it away in her purse and I casually mention to her that I think her and her parents are thieves and get up to leave.  She does not take kindly to this, and makes a fuss about needing to leave right away.  I am exiting the building and still see her still making a fuss about whatever she was talking about to everyone else.

Now I'm talking an amount not even measurable with the American dollar. Substantially less than a $5 nug, and I only got one hit out of it. I left $20 in its place with a note that said, \"Collateral\". \n\nFast forward 2 weeks later, he decides he's going to Orlando. I quickly tell him of what happened and offered to give him way more weed than I took to bring with him, plus the $20 cause I felt bad. He flipped his shit and made a scene and said he left it up there so he wouldn't have to drive with it. Very valid point, but I found out later he brought up weed anyway, but just denied my offers, and still took the $20. When he came back he was still mad and told all of our mutual friends and our parents. Said that the $20 didn't mean shit.\n\nThat's the story. First off let me say that I understand it was very wrong for me to take something that wasn't mine, which is why I apologized profusely and offered him reimbursement plus the $20.

    "selftext": "So today, my buddy Billie stopped by my house. He told me he was on his way to pick up a little weed. I was dry, and he asked if I wanted some bud because he was getting an OZ, so of course I said sure. It wasn't gonna be much, just about a bowls worth because I didn't chip in. He was a little hesitant after he asked, and almost decided against it. \n\nThat's not the first time he's done that. He always invites me to smoke and when I get there, he shows me what he's got. After a few minutes of just shootin' the shit, he ends up deciding against smoking his stuff, and suggests we only use mine. When I confront him about this, he says stuff like, \"it's my weed, you didn't pay for it. If I wanna save it for myself, I can. I don't have to smoke with you at all, ya know.\"\n\nSo anyways, he agrees that I can get a pinch for myself tonight. He tells me that after he picks up, he's gonna stop at our friend Jackson's house and give him like 5 or so grams. Okay, no big deal, he'll stop by my house after and drop it off. \n\nAfter about 3 hours of waiting for what should have been him picking up weed 3 streets over, stopping by my buddies house, and then dropping by my house really quick (probably about 45mins with hanging out at Jackson's house for a bit included) I texted him asking him what's up. He tells me, \"oh my grandpa told me to come home for dinner.\" I ask him if he dropped the weed off at Jackson's, because my house is on the way from Jackson's to Billie's. Yup. He stopped by Jackson's. Then he came clean and just said, \"I forgot lol.\"  Nope. He stayed at Jackson's for an house and a half, getting stoned and drove home completely forgetting to stop by my place. \n\nI'm just annoyed at this whole situation. This type of thing happens a lot with a lot of other things not including weed. I never ask to keep any of his stuff, he is actually the one who asks to keep some of my weed for himself. I say yes sometimes depending on what I have. I don't let him walk all over me, I just feel like if I'm gonna be a bro to you, be a bro back. And if you're gonna drive by my house without a second glance, at least text me. And don't lie saying you had to go home for dinner. \n\nHe came back really hostile with \"it's my weed man, I don't have to give you any. I said I would because I was being nice. God forbid I forget about you this one time.\" But it isn't this one time, he always does this. Am I the asshole? I mean he's right, it is his weed. Help please:(",

He was a really cool manager, and one day he asked me for a meeting. It turned out he knew little to nothing about Islam or hijab, and so he asked me if I could give him something of a schooling in my beliefs and also about hijab. I did so and he gave me the thumbs-up to wear it to work, as did the assistant manager Q. \n\n**Enter manager P**\n\n  M left, and was replaced by 'P', the current manager. One day, as I was coming in, she requested a talk  two months ago with me. She wanted a talk with me about my hijab, and we went to the manager's office to do so. She brought up the fact that I wasn't wearing it all the time at work (which I didn't for my own personal reasons). I told her about my reasons, and also the fact that manager M had already discussed this with me along with Q, and she cut me off, telling me that this wasn't their decision to make, and that he should have asked HR. I pointed out that I'd already asked at interview about this and they'd also told me the same thing. She just cut me off and told me I wasn't to wear it to work until HR had been contacted, which from what she was saying, was something she would do. \n\n**Meeting 2**\n\n Last week, I wore my hijab again, as I had guessed everything had been sorted out with HR by my manager, and if anything had been a problem, someone would have said something. \n\n  In this case, I went in and within 5min of me getting there, my manager phoned for me to go to the office. I knew automatically what this was about, and when I went in, I asked right off the bat whether she had contacted HR as she said in the last meeting.

    "selftext": "Two weeks ago I went to a party which was being held by a family friend. I went, along with my mother, and I drove everyone there in my car. The event wasn't that far from my house, about 5 miles away. \n\n  During the course of the night my mother proceeded to get pretty drunk. She'd began with a couple of glasses of wine, which I personally didn't give a toss about, but by the end of the night she was wrecked drunk, having drunk a lot of whiskey, and was shouting and screaming and just generally being totally fucking annoying. She also proceeded to argue with two people at the party, pissing them off, over some totally ridiculous thing she said (still not too sure what she said though). \n\n  So skip forward to the end of the night, around midnight, and it was time for people to leave. At this point, I told my mother that if she wanted to get home, she could get a taxi home, as there was no way on heaven or earth I was dealing with her idiotic behaviour. If anything, I'm not that confident driving at night, and having a drunk idiot to deal with would only make things harder. \n\n  But this isn't the first time she's done this either. There was an almost exact same time when she did the same at a family wedding, having become similarly plastered drunk, despite warnings from various family members, including my uncle whose car myself and my mother were travelling in, not to do so. I choose not to go out with her socially because I know all she's interested in is getting as shitfaced as possible. This is a 44 year old woman and her attitude of getting wrecked as fast as possible is more fitting for a kid. \n\n  The next morning, I got a metric ton of grief from my mother, who **demanded** that I give back to her the money she spent on a taxi home, and she kicked off about how I'd 'dumped' her and how she was 'just having some fun' and how I was 'being an asshole' for leaving her. I pointed out to her that I wasn't responsible for her behaviour and wasn't there just to act like some glorified babysitter for her to act like an A-grade moron, given I wanted to enjoy myself too. \n\n I should add as a last note that I am **not** against anyone drinking, and the alcohol isn't really an issue for me. I personally couldn't give a toss whether someone wants to drink or not. What I do have a problem is stupid behaviour. \n\nSo, AITA or my mother here?\n\n  ",

I'll admit, my brother does eat a bit too much and is overweight. But here's the thing, my cousin is morbidly obese. My guess is 350 pounds. So the other night, we were all having tea. My brother was eating a zebra cake, but he hadn't had one in years, so he was really liking it. But then he saw we had bread, so he put down the zebra cake so he could have bread instead. My sister asks, \"why don't you just eat both?\" And he replies \"Too many calories.\" All of a sudden, my cousin says, \"you were just eating a zebra cake, you obviously don't care about calories.\" I was mad. The only thing I hate more than hypocrites are racists. I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of \"Shut up about calories when you're talking to him. Look at yourself for once! Jesus!\" Yeah, that seemed to do the trick. He shut up, and didn't say a word for the rest of, the tea time. Then he moped around, acting like I insulted him for no reason. I know you might be thinking, \"maybe he is just looking out for your brother,\" but no. He said it in the same condescending way as usual. Am I the asshole or is he?",

Still staying at my home for 2 or 3 nights to get to work faster.\n\nSo. I get this phone call. Her estranged sister has just been assaulted by her bf. I need to go downstairs and give her mother the keys to the house so her and her son can stay over. I am pissed.\n\nFirstly, this woman has all but avoided her family and kept this kid away for years. Now this person who has been described as irresponsible is now going to be staying in this apt. Unsupervised. With a toddler. For what is supposed to be 3 days (I know it will be longer).\n\nNow AITA because I'm upset that she made this decision without my consultation? Without my input?

I'm just annoyed that she went to save this person who has been less than sisterly to her and has been known to screw up crap alone in \"our\" apt.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention I was asked by her mother to \"examine\" the sister to see if her nose is broken.

Now anyone who's been in a Lidl knows that the shop isn't that big, and my local one is probably no more than 4 long aisles.  \n\n  I went in and I noticed up ahead that a woman had come in with 3 kids, one of which was a baby in a pram she was pushing. Another two kids were basically running up and down the aisles making pests of themselves and getting under people's feet, which annoyed me in its own right. A couple of times they collided with me or came close to being whacked with a trolley. The mother was nowhere to be seen.\n\n  I got to the third or so aisle down and I was stood at a freezer, trying to find something. Now as I stepped backwards to return to my trolley, one of these kids came belting down and crashed straight into me, and she went flying a good couple of feet backwards. She began absolutely screaming the place down, and at this point the mother came over and the fun started. \n\nMother: ''Well, aren't you going to apologize?!'' \n\nMe: ''Excuse me?'' \n\nMother: ''You knocked my little girl over!''\n\nMe: ''Yes, I did. However if you'd bothered to supervise her and keep her from running around the store getting in everyone's way, that wouldn't have happened. Your kid isn't special in this regard'' \n\nMother: ''How dare you! I've got as much right to be with my kids as anyone!''\n\nMe: ''I'm not saying anything to the contrary. However you are a **parent** and so it seems that you haven't taught your children, any of them, basic courtesy for others. This is a supermarket, not a playground, and so I have a reasonable expectation of being able to shop without a game of human pinball!''\n\nAt this point I just walked off and did the rest of my shopping. \n\nSo reddit, who was the asshole here?

    "selftext": "So, a bit of backstory. Said friend - referred to as J - has been known in our social circle as an atheist since at least the seventh grade. J has always been very open with it - me, him and our friends have always made jokes about it and religion in general when religious people weren't around (we aren't the type to bemoan people for their religion.) Hell, in grade 10 he nearly got mugged for saying that he believed God didn't exist.\n\nSo, flash forward to today. I was talking to his girlfriend, R, during class. R is a very religious, girly, powder-puff Southern girl, which we've all found ironic considering what we thought to be true. \n\nI mentioned offhandedly that he wasn't very religious when we were referring to a teacher of ours that would constantly insert religious references into her teaching. R had said that J didn't care for that teacher very much, and I mentioned it was probably because of said references due to his beliefs.\n\nR seemed shocked, and said, \"But J goes to church with me!\" I was shocked, but then I said, \"That's odd, because J regularly hangs out with (other friends, all non-religious) and I and we always shoot the shit about it.\" She got visibly very sour and said \"Well, I don't want him hanging around you guys! I'm gonna yell at him.\"\n\nIn between classes, I sent him a text saying that I think I fucked up, I thought R was mad at him and that I think she hated me now. Shortly after, I see them speaking in the middle of campus, and J looks over to me and approaches me. \n\n\"So, Tazmily228. First off, you're a dick.\" J is/was a good friend of mine, so all I said was \"Okay.\" for fear of turning it into an argument. \"Second: When was the last time I spoke to you about my personal life?\" In this instance I assumed his religious beliefs, and I responded, \"About a month ago at A's house when we were playing DnD.' Indeed, we had been shooting the shit about religion and discussing it over pizza during a late-night DnD session.\n\nJ  responded, \"Well, you don't know anything about my personal life, so I advise you stay out of it.\" And walked off and sat down with R.\n\nI don't know what I did. I didn't intend to offend anybody, and if J suddenly became a Christian, he didn't tell me - or anybody. I asked several of our mutual friends/acquaintances about it and they all responded \"J isn't religious at all.\" or some variant. Am I the asshole for assuming, given *strong* evidence?",

    "selftext": "So a bit of backstory in May of this year I was involved in a wreck where I was hit by a drunk driver and then she hauled ass off in her truck and hit a light pole about a mile down the road and was arrested. \n\n\nSo since then I have had to go to physical therapy for several months out of my pocket until I can get reimbursed (I've spent almost $1000 just on that and Dr visits and I only make $8.12/hr) anyways I always took solace in the fact that she was in jail for what she did I looked up her arrest record to find out that less than a year ago she had received another sui charge and had her liscense suspended. \n\n\nSo after dealing with the insurance company for about 2 months I decided that I should get a lawyer come to find out that she got charged with dui, driving with a suspended license and failure to yield. She was found not guilty of everything but the failure to yield so I'm fucking pissed about that already. \n\n\nNow here's where the new thing happened I checked my email this morning and saw I got an email from my lawyer and it read \n\n\n\" Good morning vapormaker843:\u00a0 I received a call this morning from Progressive advising that this claim was not reported to them until they received my letter.\u00a0 They are asking for an explanation as to why the claim was not reported at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Can you please update me in this regard?\u00a0 Thank you for your continued cooperation and I will anticipate your expeditious response.\" \n\n\nNow please know neither me not the drunk idiot have progressive as put insurance provider. \n\n\nSo why is my lawyer sending out personal information about me to a company that has nothing to do with them. And more importantly they are taking 33% or whatever I win so I'm paying them a third of my money and they can't even send the paperwork to the right insurance company. \n\u00a0\nSo is sent her back an email saying this \n\n\n\"Good afternoon ms. Lawyerlady,\n\n\nSo I'm trying to figure out why progressive got sent anything at all? I have \"a good neighbor\" as my insurance provider and ms. Drunk idiot's insurance provider \"is on her side\". No one involved in the accident has progressive.\u00a0\n\n\nSo if you could please help clear this up I would appreciate it.\"\n\n\nThat was about as nice as I could word it. ( I still think I was. a bit too polite but I was raised to always treat people how you would like to be treated thanks southern hospitality!)\n\n\nAs of yet I haven't heard back but in seriously contemplating getting rid of them and finding legal assistance elsewhere. \n\n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit:some spelling\n",

(Not sure how but I forgot to give the griptape guy the 15 when I met up with him and so did he) I ask my buddy for my twenty back about 4-5 days after I lend it to him, he says if I want my money, I have to go to a local skatepark and ask people if they want a type of drug he had, since he's into a bunch of various drugs. I tell him no, basically said that's not my responsibility and I shouldn't have to do this to get my money back. (Keep in mind he's being fairly vague until now. It took about 3 texts for me to understand one thing he was sayin.) He then tells me he'll give me $8 to pay back the griptape guy. (Which is weird because I would've been paying the griptape guy back with my friends money, and I don't know who would owe who.) I was getting pretty mad at him and being pretty blunt, so once I understood, I apologized. I told him I was sorry for blowing up and that I misunderstood.

I don't reply because, fuck that. No money, No grinder.

    "selftext": "Heya reddit :) I know it's sort of an out-there question, so I definitely need to give you guys some background so that this makes more sense. I have been working as an escort for about 16 months now. As a college student, it is a wonderful source of income because I make insane money per hour and so only need to work a tenth - maybe even a twentieth of what other college students are working to finance themselves. This was all well and good until about 12 months ago when I met my boyfriend. At the beginning we just met through mutual friends and enjoyed hanging out. Pretty shortly after, we ended up hooking up and right after I immediately came out to him as a sex-worker. When I told him this, he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact, he seems really interested in it, asking a lot of insightful questions and also remarking that he was pretty turned on that he was getting what other people payed so much for.  He also remarked that he didn't think it was too big of a deal because he usually only dated in an 'open-relationship' paradigm where sex with others is not cheating. This is the kind of relationship I like also.\n\nNeedless to say I was totally thrilled by this because to be honest I thought that I would be single for as long as I escorted. I couldn't imagine someone being comfortable enough with it that they could date me. I was also really into him, so obviously this response of his propelled us into a relationship, which over time has become very serious and intimate. We now live together and for the most part are very happy together. \n\nHere's the tricky part. For awhile, his words rang true. I was always honest with him about when I was working and at what hotel in the city (He insisted on knowing for safety reasons) and he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact he would occasionally drive me or pick me up afterwards and we would talk about our day/how it went with no awkwardness or tension at all. However, in the last 4 months or so I have noticed his attitude change. It isn't every time I work, but some nights (especially nights where I see regulars) he is very subdued and quiet when I get home, or else he can be totally passive-aggressive. The weird thing is that whenever I bring it up he denies that it bothers him. I don't want to stop doing sex-work, because I genuinely enjoy it and there isn't anything else a 22 year old could do and make 300/hr. That being said, I am very in love with him and hate the idea of hurting him.\n\n This situation has become very frustrating because I never tried to hide what I do and was very upfront with him before we started dating that this is a part of who I am, and he now occasionally makes me feel guilty for it. I recognize that it is not an easy thing to accept in a partner, but if that is the case then I feel like he should have told me from the beginning.\n\nYou might have guessed that the open relationship part has become less than wonderful too. When we were newly dating we both hooked up with others on occasion (maybe once a month or so) and were honest about it. However, recently he has stopped engaging in sex with other people and says that he only feels attracted to me. While I am deeply into him sexually and romantically, I still have the occasional desire for a one night stand. Again, I feel somewhat manipulated because I now have loads of guilt about that desire even though we talked about it before dating and clearly laid it out as acceptable. \n\nAm I the asshole reddit? I am certainly a handful, I will make no claims against that. I know that it is not easy to date a sex-worker, and I know that he has insecurities about his body. He has confessed a fear that I will leave him for someone 'more attractive'. i find this totally ridiculous, because I adore his body. He is 'beefy' but I really like that, and he knows I like that. \n\nI guess I'm just looking to hear from a third party about this situation. Thank you so much for bothering to read my wall-of-text. You rock :)",

We went to my house for a little bit just to spend some time together (she texted her mom to let her know that she was safe). We watched a TV show here and there and then spent the next few hours just talking to each other, kissing and cuddling. Without us realizing, it got a little late and we grew tired. She asked if she could take a quick nap which I said was no problem. However, I ended up falling asleep as well and when I came to, it was 2:00 in the morning. I realized that I was way too tired to safely drive her home and we ended up spending the night together and didn\u2019t wake up until 7:00 this morning. My parents were already asleep by this time and I didn\u2019t want to wake them and I hoped that they\u2019d be understanding. \n\nA few minutes after we were both awake, I made her breakfast and then drove her home.

I have to have a gov class to graduate and between taking IB classes, I have not found the time to get the class in. So me and my friend got in the same class and we sit in the back together.   \n\nI'll admit. I love politics with a burning passion, but in my family I never get a chance to talk about them because my hyper conservative father will scream over me and my mother just sides with who ever is currently bitching about whatever. I'm in a friend group of mostly guys who are incredibly liberal and they all end up screaming over me, so in gov class (despite the demographic that is the rest of the classs) I can finally speak my opinion. This pisses off my female friend.  \n\nOf course, I didn't know this at first. I'm a tad oblivious to social cues that would tell me I was upsetting her. Turns out she has been complaining about me to my other friends for the past month about how when she was around me she \"couldn't have an opinion\" etc etc, despite the fact I let her talk about what she believes before stating my opinion. I do realize now I've sort have been steam rolling her, and for this part, I am the jerk.  \n\nBut then here's the part I'm wondering about this. It's this sort of behavior that upsets me so much. This passiveness. So I'm upset. Plus she is incredibly two faced and a liar. I've spent the past four years trying to invite her places and to get close to her only to have her cancel a day before we hang out. And then she goes behind my back and tells everyone how much she likes me and how she wishes we were closer. So I try again. Except I am tired of being the person to initiate everything. I'm sick of her *lying* about how much she likes me and then doing everything the opposite. I'm sick of her turning every conversation about her and how she wants to live in Japan and how everything would be better in Japan and how much our home country sucks. AITA for feeling this way?

He's not a bad person, just very immature and a bit annoying.  Due to the fact that he lives across the hall from me and is not intolerable, we hang out a little bit.  Never one on one, but more like I'll sometimes be in there when there's a group drinking some beers, watching a game or whatever.  This one time we were in the dining hall with a group and he expressed interest in going to hit on this girl who he knows from class.  Knowing him, it was a slightly embarrassing attempt at anything, mostly due to his absurd confidence in his ability to \"pick up chicks\".  The girl was not into it.  Bottom line: I knew Joe was interested in this particular girl.\n\nFast forward a couple days.  It was a typical dorm room Friday with people getting drunk in various rooms before going out for the night.  My usual crew ended up in his room that night and everyone was having a good time.  People are always coming in an out, and within a half hour of being there, said girl walks in with a couple friends.  Somehow she ends up sitting on the couch next to me and we really hit it off.  To make a long story short we hooked up that night.  And the next.  Since we did meet in Joe's room, Joe is very aware of this fact.  He's pretty pissed at me now and is giving me the cold shoulder and slammed the door on my friend who asked if he wanted to come hang out with us in my room.  Am I the asshole?  How should I proceed?  \n\nI'm obviously aware of how this hurt his feelings and why he's reacting this way, but it didn't stop me from letting stuff happen with the girl.\n\n",

Even if you didn't know it was Serbian the Cyrillic writing on the front was prominent enough that someone would know that it wasn't English. \n\n  Now the train was busy but I managed to find a seat in a corner and I just quietly got on with reading. Now a couple of seats down this man kept looking at me and muttering something I couldn't quite hear. My guess is that he saw the book and just assumed I was non-English speaking or something.\n\nAfter a while he became more vocal and I could hear stupid comments about how I 'should' be reading in English and how it was 'disgusting' that I was in public like I was. \n\n  I proceeded to loom directly in his direction quite audibly call him a rather rude name in Serbian (budala, meaning fool or idiot). This was more to make him aware that I was hearing him than anythiing else, and he seemed to shut up. \n\n About 5min later he began chanting 'EDL, EDL' and making comments about how I.should be deported, as well as a number of comments like ''England's for English people only\".

But no-one did anything. \n\n By this point I got ridiculously pissed because I just wanted to resd in peace. I got up out of my seat, went over to him and got right in his face. I was so pissed off however that I initially spoke to him in Serbian, telling him \"da, govorim srpski jezik. Da li imate problem?!\". (Yes, I speak Serbian. Do you have a problem?\"). Then I shouted at him in English that he needed to keep his pathetic pea-brained opinions to himself among other things. \n\nChances are that he didn't actually understand what I said to him initially, and I'm wondering if this, or my whole confrontation with him pushed me into asshole category. \n\nSo I'm going to let reddit decide who was the asshole here?\n\n  ",

    "selftext": "I was born with an anxiety disorder that has slowly destroyed my life since I was 13. I've gone through 2 psychiatrists and 1 psychologist specializing in neuro-feedback therapy. After dozens of therapy sessions, emergency hospital visits, and thousands of dollars worth of medical debt, my only form of control over my anxiety has been taking xanax for the past 6+ years. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years and my anxiety disorder has yet to be fully understood by her. We've had arguments before about it and she's said things like, \"Everyone stresses out all the time, you're not alone in this\" and \"All you need to do is thing positive thoughts and relax\" or \"Being addicted to drugs isn't the answer\". She can't seem to grasp the uncontrollable, life grasping, dark and depressing nature of anxiety and how it is a mental disorder and not just a mood swing. I think it's because she and her family have never dealt with mental disorder before and, like many of us redditors deal with, have no idea what the solution or results are.\n\nSo I went to her dentist's office today because I wanted to try a new dentist. When I went today, I asked her dentist if she could schedule the first cleaning for another time because I have anxiety and I need to take medicine to be able to be calm through even the most basic medical procedures. In fact, I start to hyperventilate, get short breath, and panic when I go to job interviews if I don't take xanax beforehand. So her dentist totally understood and told me she's there to make things as comfortable as I need. I was on the phone with my girlfriend just talking about my day and I told her this bit and she says, \"Why didn't you let her just do the cleaning? She would have let you relax or calm down if you needed to\" but it's not as simple as that. If I begin to get an anxiety attack, it will take a lot of downtime for me to get past it and the experience of it is too horrible for me to willingly go through. I tried to tell my girlfriend this and she says, \"Okay fine, whatever, I just think you don't need to pop pills all the time and should have just let her do her job.\" ... So I stayed silent for a bit and then just hung up on her. Now I'm pissed off at her and just wanna cuss her out.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I have a god damn mental disorder that's plagued me for the past 10+ years and it will most likely stay with me for the rest of my life. I would have probably killed myself long ago if I didn't have xanax to keep my brain from going crazy and my body from self destructing. But it's all trivialized by my girlfriend, as if it's just something to shrug off my shoulder and easily fixed with a bright smile or something. \n\n**TL;DR: I need to take medicine before I even have a cleaning at the dentists office because of my anxiety but my girlfriend doesn't think my anxiety is a real problem and that I need to get over it.**",

A policeman arrives and we get the situation sorted and everything is all good. \n\nHowever, once I told them, they got super mad because it was a $100~ fine or something. They want me to pay it. \n\nThey had not mentioned the house alarm once, and they have admitted that. However, they believe that I should \"own up to my mistake\" and pay them back. \n\nEDIT: thanks guys, I'll stand my ground\n",

    "selftext": "One of my best friends has a fiance named John. He is a very smart and funny guy who I've always gotten along with, but generally has problems getting along with a lot of people. He is constantly making inappropriate jokes, saying what's on his mind without thinking about it, offending people, and challenging authority. I've always respected his honesty and crude sense of humor, but for these reasons he has always had problems holding down jobs. I've worked at a group home for seniors with traumatic brain injuries for about two years. One day, my friend (his fiancee) asked me if I could get him a job at my group home. I was hesitant because of his personality, but there were open shifts at the home and I felt like I needed to help him out. So, I got him a job. Immediately he started to ruffle feathers. I work with  8 other people and every one of them hated John within the first two weeks. I still loved him as a friend, but even I couldn't stand working with him. He was just annoying, constantly following people around and questioning things (normal for new employees, but his way of doing it was just obnoxious and intrusive). \n\nThe first part of this incident happened like this\u2026one of his running jokes with me was about \"blumpkins\". We would both basically just say the word randomly to each other to get a laugh. One day, I was teaching him how to change a client's diaper. This was everyone's favorite client (Henry). Henry had overheard one of us say the word \"bumpkin\" and he asked what it meant. John didn't say anything and looked to me to see if I would respond. I have a great rapport with Henry as I've worked there for two years, and he asked what the word meant so I went ahead and told him. I said \"A blumpkin is when a man receives oral sex on a toilet.\" John seemed pretty surprised that I said this to a client and he said, \"You can say stuff like that to them?\" I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Well, he asked what it was. And he'll probably forget about it in 5 minutes.\" Then we moved on and that was that. Henry did forget about it. \n\nThen, about a month later, things had gotten worse with John and the rest of my coworkers/supervisors. I talked to him about this several times and he actually agreed that it would be best if he transferred group homes because of how bad his relationship with our manager was getting. The week before he was going to transfer, he was standing around talking to me while I was brushing Henry's teeth and getting him ready for bed. This night, our supervisor was a good friend of mine who had to work with John the most and was getting very frustrated with him. While I was brushing Henry's teeth, John came up to him and said, \"Hey Henry, have you ever fucked a girl in the butt?\" Henry was not amused by this question, and just scowled at John. Henry usually doesn't appreciate crude humor like this and wasn't in a great mood this evening. I gave John a look that said \"Don't push this.\" But, he did push it. He asked the same question again and Henry became visibly upset. He slammed his fist down on his wheelchair and yelled something at John that we couldn't make out. I told John that Henry had been in group homes with a traumatic brain injury since he was 18 years old, so the subject of sex and virginity is a touchy one. My supervisor witnessed this entire incident from across the room but hadn't heard what anyone had said. I immediately removed Henry from the living room and took him into his room to calm him down. As soon as I got in there, my supervisor came in and asked me what had happened. Without even thinking about it, I told her the truth. The next day, John texted me and told me that she had told our house manager what had happened and that he was being investigated for verbal abuse and got put on paid leave. He then told me that I \"better be ready to lie for him\". I told him I was not comfortable lying, especially since I had already told my supervisor the truth right after it happened. John got very upset with me because I told our supervisor the truth knowing that she didn't like him, and I should have known she would report the incident and he would get in trouble. He's right, I should have known that, but it wasn't what I was thinking about. I was thinking about Henry. His other reason for being so mad is that I taught him it was OK to say things like that to clients. \n\nIt's now been about six months since this happened. John ended up quitting before the verbal abuse investigation even concluded. He has not talked to me since. He unfriended me on Facebook and told me that I am no longer allowed in his house. This has ruined my relationship with my best friend. I do feel a little guilty for ratting him out, but it was not my intention to get him fired or hurt him in any way. I was interviewed about all of this by HR of my company and also a rep from Adult Protective Services and I told them EVERYTHING, including the \"blumpkin\" incident, which was extremely embarrassing. Even though six months has passed, I still think about this all the time and am greatly saddened by my loss of friendship with both John and my best friend. Am I the asshole?",

I'm not just talking about a few puffs of weed or some nonsense,  but harder stuff too, including heroin and cocaine.

Eventually towards the end of the semester I asked her, \"so do y'all have like an open relationship?\" \"Yeah\".\n\nEventually the semester ends, but she and I still talk. So we decide to hang out one day and get lunch/she'll show me her apartment. That she shares. With her boyfriend. Anyway she flirts with me through lunch and we drive back to her place. We talk while she smokes (cigarettes) and after a good while she decides she wants to change because it's hot.\n\nSo she takes her shirt off saying don't look, rather playfully, and of course I do. She remarked that she thought her chest was small, I told her they were a good handful and she offered for me to feel them. At that point I just pulled her onto the bed and we had sex. The thing is soon afterward she said I had to go as her boyfriend would be home soon.\n\nThis all lead to what became an affair, and I thought at the end of it I would accept whatever came. So naturally, he found out. However, his reaction was to blame himself. He thought it had happened because he didn't spend enough time with her. So at this point we stop seeing each other and don't talk for a while, but she did break up with him soon after for reasons not involving me.\n\nSo am I an asshole?

He knew I had come into a little bit of money and spent a lot on people I hung out with so naturally he hung out with me a lot.  He was unemployed and flat broke.  I'm not going into a whole lot of details but I bought this dude a lot of stuff.  I never asked for repayment but he said when he got a job, he'd get me back. He ended up getting into trouble for stealing a bunch of stuff from this girls house during a party when she drank too much and passed out.  Him and a bunch of people pretty much just ransacked the house stealing pretty much everything and wrecking what they didn't steal.  Some how he ends up only getting 4 months of work release.  When he goes to jail he's dating some 16 year old teeny bopper and he works with another friend of mine, (we'll call him Zach) at a Car Dealership. At the car dealership some dude traded in his horse trailer for a truck, so there's this horse trailer out back of the car lot.  Chris (dude in jail) is periodically having Zach drive his teenie-weenie girlfriend up there so he can bang her in the horse trailer.  This little act of his kind of violates my morals in some way so I devise a plan to get Chris caught.  The plan goes like this: When Chris is at work next and asks Zach to go get this little bubble-gummer for another romp in the horse trailer, I call the jail he's at and tell them about it.  So a few days later, Zach calls me and tells me he's on his way to pick the twenager up.  I call the jail and tell them about the horse trailer.  Sure enough Zach gets there to drop her off and there's a corrections officer sitting in the back of the lot watching the whole thing play out. When Chris gets back to jail from his job they were only going to not let him go to work for three days....until they found out the girl was not yet a woman.

So my dad asks me if I want to go see a movie and I ask him which one, my stepmom suggests Sherlock Holmes 2 (which was in theaters at the time) and I tell them I don't want to see it as I haven't seen the first, the response basically amounts to \"we'll figure something out\" and I tell them before we leave that I absolutely do not want to see it as I have not seen the first movie so suggest that we rent the first one from redbox and see the second at a later date. They agree but suggest that we go see a movie at the theater anyways and just see whats playing. Halfway there my stepmom changes her mind and says that we should go see it anyways because a friend told her it doesn't ruin the first movie. I tell them to not buy me a ticket for the movie because I do not want to ruin my experience with the first. We get to the theater and she tells my dad to buy the three tickets so I tell them not to buy one for me because if they do then I won't go into the theater to see the movie. They buy me a ticket anyways thinking that I'm bluffing so I sit outside for a good 15 minutes before they come back out and yell at me for ruining our night out saying that they were being generous to pay for my ticket and they paid for my plane ticket to fly out to Hawaii so I should go along with it.\n\nNow I get that plane tickets to hawaii are not cheap, especially considering that it was around christmas time and I agreed to go out there but they do crap like this all the time trying to spend money on me that I tell them I don't want them to spend before they actually spend it and say they won't try to throw it in my face later only to turn around and throw it in my face later.\n\n",

I called her and there was no response for half an hour. She calls me at 4:15 and says she will be 20 minutes. I go to a coffee shop across the street. 6pm rolls around and she finally shows up with two teenage friends.

I brought her her only birthday present this year (some art books) and everything seemed fine when I left.

Humans are not limited to the tiny square you seem to be living in.\"\n\nMe: \"It would be one thing if the person was born here but the person is a Chinese foreign student. In Universities there are groups of people that come straight from China that dress and act quite differently. Chinese people who were born here don't have anything in common with the.

I think this person is just hard to tell their gender.\"\n\nHer: \"Well I'm sorry you seem to think you know everything but I hate to be the one that puts you in a bad mood by telling you you're not always right but if you had spent as much time memorizing statistics that don't apply to you as you had looking at the bus schedule you wouldn't be waiting in the cold like a dumbass which by the way isn't my problem.

I get a quesadilla and a drink, he gets his own food and we leave.\n\n We are driving and I'm about to eat the quesadilla and he takes a huge Ass chunk of it and is like \"this is your payment for me driving you\" (I'm like whatever he does this crap all the time) \n\nit's probably 10:20 and we are driving and he asks \"where do you want to go next?\" And I say \"home, I gotta be there at 10:30\" and he says \"that doesn't matter, let's go to Wal-Mart\" \n\nThere is no talking him out of it, we are going to Wal-Mart. We go in and do absolutely nothing for about 30 minutes. Finally we leave, I was supposed to be home 20 minutes ago. He was driving and then he takes a different turn (the opposite way from our neighborhood)\n\nI ask him \"where are we going?\" And he says \"oh I'm just about to go get a bj from this one chick, is that cool with you?\" And I say \"no that's not cool with me, I was supposed to be home twenty minutes ago\" then he just tells me \"don't worry, I will make it fast\" (this is 100% bullshit)\n\nWe go pick up this sleezy chick so he can get this bj and we are just sitting in this neighborhood (it isn't ours or hers, it's just a place to do the nasty) I know what's about to happen so I got out of the car and sat outside about a street away.\n\nI was somewhat mad before but now I'm nearly pissed, it was soo cold outside and we had major winds that night. I wanna say it was maybe 25 something degrees and I had nothing for protection except a hoodie.\n\nI was supposed to be home at 10:30 and at the time it was probably 11:30 so my mom was calling me telling me I need to get home now. I just told her we were driving home.\n\nThe part about him being fast was a major lie, about 30 minutes in, things got crazy, apparently a dude robbed a house not too long ago and they were trying to find him with a search helicopter and it is going right over this neighborhood. It was getting super close to me and I thought \"I didn't do anything but what if it sees me and I get in trouble for loitering or they could think I was the robber.\" the spotlight from the helicopter was about a dozen feet away and I decided \"Fuck it, let's get under a car\" so I do. The helicopter flies away and I get back up.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later (about 11:45) that ho gets out of his car and I get back in trying to warm up because it was so cold outside. I told him what happened and that I need to be home right now. He is driving super fast and we get home, my mom and dad are pissed. I tell him it's his fault and that's that.\n\nAll of that happened Friday night this is what happened today (Monday)\n\nHe was telling our other friend \"yeah man, I got some head\" then I said \"yeah, while I was outside freezing my Ass off.\" Then he kinda laughed and said \"dude you could have just stayed in the backseat.\" (He was serious) I told him, \"that chick would never blow you with me in the backseat\" and he is just kinda like \"yeah she would, whatever\"\n\nHe brings up the robbery part and he changes up the whole story so it makes it sound like I'm a complete idiot. It kinda went something like this \"yeah, Cody was just outside and a cop car comes down the street and he hides under a car, Cody your so stupid\" after all this I was about to snap.\n\nI TRY to correct him. I say \"it was a search helicopter\" and he interrupts every word I say like a child. Then he says \"either way, your fuckin stupid.\" I keep telling my story and I say \"what would happen if the helicopter saw me? Even if I wasn't the robber I still could have got slapped with another stupid charge.\" Again he interrupted me so nobody could hear like a word I said. then I did snap.\n\nI said \"shut the fuck up, I'm tired of your shit\" (he always acts tough in front of our friends) he gets all up in my face and said \"what did you say? I'm about to spit in your face right now for talking to me like that.\"\n\nAfter that he just told me I was being a dick and that's why I came to this subreddit. I'm tired of his shit and I was wondering if I was an asshole because I don't think I am.",

He does and I let him hop in the passenger's seat while I finish going through the drive through. I ask if he smokes and I hand him a cigarette when he says he does. He has told me his car is right down the road, but as soon as we get on said road, he tells me to turn down a different one. He then asks if I have a gas can. \"No, why do you need a gas can, I thought you needed a jump?\" He then precedes to tell me that the tow truck around the corner has a gas can and that's what he really needs because he ran out of gas. At this point I am thinking, \"what the fuck man, why would you lie about this shit?

    "selftext": "So I have this friend (let's call her Zee)....\n-----------------\n**Backstory:** \n\nWe became friends roughly 9 yrs ago, when I was going through a rough patch. (I have since gone to therapy and cleaned up my act). During this time, I was sometimes difficult to be around. I'd make plans and cancel last minute (or would be super late) because I'd have a breakdown and didn't want to go out all puffy from crying. She was always a bit abrasive, but at that point in my life I figure I deserved it for jerking her around. \n\nSince then (about 5 years ago), she moved across the country, came out as trans, and comes to visit once or twice a year. She got a fantastic job out there and makes 6 figures. She bought a house, a dog, and a new BMW so she could take her old lexus apart and convert it to electric. Meanwhile, me and my SO of 10+ yrs are still living in a crappy apartment and barely making rent. I'm a little jealous, but I actually like my life now and I'm mostly happy (a huge step up from where I was 10 years ago).\n\n---------------------\n**Now for the meat of the story:**\n\nMy SO started a startup that mostly crashed and burned. Zee loaned him some money to get it off the ground (about 20,000). It was supposed to be a short term loan, but shit happened (including an employee that embezzled ~ $25,000) and it hasn't gotten paid back. She's said it was cool (she makes 6 figures and is *by no means* in financial trouble) and that we could pay her back when it wouldn't be a burden to do so. She told us to \"think of it as a gift\" and that she didn't expect us to pay her back.\n\nSince then, we've dug the company out a bit and things are looking up (got a contract with a national chain! Yay!), but we've still been working our asses off and barely making rent (950 a month); All four of us in the company have been threatened with eviction in the past year. We're not starving, but it wouldn't take much to put us under, even now.\n\nZee came to visit us this week. We were attending an event that we all make a point to go to together. It's expensive for us (hotel and such), but we (mostly I) save up and have a good time. We (me and SO) shared a hotel room with Zee to cut costs and some other friends of ours drove up. \n\nThe SO (without talking to me or Zee) offered to let our friends crash on our bed and get me and him a cot from the front desk. I was a little miffed by this because last year we were supposed to split a hotel with these friends, but they fucked off and left us with the bill (which is a lot for us). So now I'm supposed to smile and let them stay for free this year? &gt;:(\n\nThis is where I do a stupid thing. I go and have lunch with Zee and mildly vent about the hotel nonsense. She then tells me \"**You shouldn't complain because [my SO] hasn't paid her back yet\".**\n\nNow me and the SO have separate finances, and I am not really involved in the start up (though I try to help out anyway). I don't get paid by said start up, and I had no part in the loan between her and my SO. Furthermore, she invested in a *start up* and anyone can tell you that any such investment carries some risk. And to top it all off, she's in no way hurting from this, and for him to pay her back (even 100$ a month) would bankrupt us and probably end up with all four of us in the company being homeless. So I'm pretty pissed about this, but I swallow my feelings and try to defend him gently, saying that we'd get her her money as soon as we could. And I even apologize for being grumpy and venting to her. But she didn't back off at all.  I let it go and try to have a good time, but 24 hrs later and back at my apartment (where she is staying with us) I'm even more upset about it.\n\n\n***Am I the asshole for being upset about this?***\n\nShould I just let it go? Should I tell my SO? Should I fess up to the SO and tell her and him that I don't want her coming to visit anymore? ",

At 73(?) years old, she's taken ill with a chronic respiratory condition that requires her to be on oxygen all the time.  She needs assistance with some tasks, but (by her doctor's advisement) is capable of accomplishing most tasks independently.  For now.\n\nMore background:  my mother is a certified narcissist. She only cares about herself, and everyone else she considers her \"loved ones\" are there to support her and give her life structure and connection. She has always wanted only to be taken care of by the people around her.  \n\nAs far as her health, my mother ignores doctor's advice, and cancels appointments at whim. We encourage her to be independent and active (key aspects of living successfully at any age, but particularly at her age), but she is argumentative, and refuses to do anything to help herself.  We offer support (logistically) when we can, but it's extremely frustrating to deal with her, for these reasons and more.\n\nShe was abusive (physically and emotionally) to my sister and I our whole childhood and mentally/emotionally cruel on through young adulthood and beyond.  She was unable to help us at any stage of our life, and worse, she was a detriment to our lives for the most part.  She is a horrible person who just assumed someone would step up to take her in.  Our relationship is, at best, strained.  My mother and father separated when we were young, and she never remarried.

We don't have the means to be the caretaker for her--even if we wanted to, which we don't.

    "selftext": "Howdy all. I live in a fairly small city/town in central Oklahoma. We have a fairly large transient population due to 1) high drug use around here, 2) being on rail and highway corridors near OKC, 3) a relatively poor local economy, and 4) lots of reservations nearby (four actually within or right next to town).\n\nThis town has fairly limited services, but we do actually have a local library (and had a Carnegie library that was more centrally located but the town refused to maintain it, and that's another rant on my part) that is located in our decaying downtown area. So now we get to the meat of my post.\n\nEvery time you go in the damn library, there's hobos outside wanting this or that or the other. They sit outside and smoke all day, and leave their cigarette butts everywhere. They harass people going into the library. They stink up the place (literally, they smell fucking horrible). They're rude.\n\nJust the other day, a homeless guy in a wheelchair was sitting in front of the door. I offered to help him in, and he accepted. After I wheeled him across the threshold, the smell hit me-- old cat urine, cheap tobacco smoke, and rancid food. Just imagine being waterboarded with a bucket of Chinese food mixed with cat urine (from concentrate) that had been sitting out in the Texas summer for two weeks, mixed with the juices from a roadkilled rabid raccoon that had eaten nothing but skunk. Imagine the slimy brown juice sliding inexorably into your nostrils, dripping down into the back of your mouth, the hot-sweat-and-metal tang of the rusty bucket... that's how bad this dude smelled.\n\nAnyway, I went into the main part of the library and he stayed in the foyer... and after a few minutes, you could smell this guy in the library itself. He never went in, either. He just sat there staring at everyone as they went in and out.\n\nQuite frankly, there's no excuse for that. The tribes have quite a few social programs and there are two homeless shelters nearby. The only requirement for those is that you can't bring drugs or weapons in with you. These people *should not* be a burden on normal citizens, but instead they choose to hang out at our library and harass us.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors, I ask you... AITA for hating the hobos who sit out in front of our library? If so, why?",

Here are some of the signs:\n\n1. She's facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she's looking at, all the while saying, \"mhmm, yeah... uh huh\"\n2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. \"OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.\"\n3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.\n\nAnd the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.\n\nNow I'm not an attention whore by any means. I've learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn't even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I've gotten used to it by now, so I'll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I'll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, \"Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don't.\"\nOr I'll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like \"Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it's not even important. How was your day?\"\n\nAnd now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She interrupts me mid sentence and says:\n\nGF: \"Honey don't we know those two people from somewhere?\"\n\nMe: \"I dunno\" and just stopped talking\n\nGF: \"Sorry, what were you saying?\" \n\nMe: \"Nothing, never mind\"\n\nGF: \"I said sorry, jeez. Why are you always like this?\"\n\nMe: \"What? I'm just not going to waste my energy talking when you don't care.\"\n\nGF: \"What's your problem?\"\n\nMe: \"Nothing, I'm just tired of being interrupted and ignored. Don't you think it's rude to do that? I always listen to you and anyone else that talks to me because I actually care, but sometimes you just don't care, so I don't care either.\"\n\nGF: \"Relax, I just wanted to know if you knew who they were. Why do you have to be so sensitive about this all the time? I'm listening to you.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, so what was I talking about then?\"\n\nGF: \"Fine, whatever.\"\n\nThis has happened to me all my life because my family has always ignored me. Thus, I've always been courteous to other people by doing something as simple as listening to them when they talk. My girlfriend's closest friend and cousin is exactly like this and I've actually had arguments with them in the past about this type of thing being disrespectful to the person talking to you but they think it's trivial.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Do I not have a point? I get that sometimes we all have thoughts in our heads that suck up all of our attention but this happens very frequently.\n\n**TL;DR Girlfriend has a short attention span, interrupts me when I'm talking because of something trivial and I can't stand it, so I stop talking.**",

I do the whole \"Wow, you guys are so racist, not all of us are like that\" and things are getting louder as they are (jokingly but with conviction) that we all are and I feel a hand slap across my face and look up to see my girlfriend looking at me with a slightly remorseful face and her hand coming back to her side. I'm thouroughly pissed that she did that and immediately left with them yelling behind me still about white people. I text her later that night saying something like \"yeah ya know i hate all filipinos too. they are FOBs and just eat dogs.\" still playing along with the racism. Now I didn't actually feel this way but wanted to show her how it felt. Convo continued like this when she says you can't be racist againt white people. \n\nNow I'm pissed about this and her hitting me so i say \"wow babe, your usually smart but that sentence just dropped your IQ by 25 points\". She restates her sentence and convo goes on without more insults.\n\nThe next day after we stopped texting I meet up with her and she says she is very offended with what I said and dumps me. I just really don't say much as I don't think she is that serious but she walks away and texts me about how hurt she is.

    "selftext": "Often, my brother and I find works of fiction that we enjoy, and want the other to read. We enjoy talking to each other a lot, so we want the other to watch/read/play stuff so we can talk about it.\n\nThe problem is that my brother is incredibly flakey about trying things that I want him to try, even though he'll still find new things to try on his own.\n\nA few years back, I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and loved it. And I knew he would love it to. So I asked him to read it. He said he would later when he felt like it. At that time, the situation I just described wasn't really in place, so I didn't think much of it. Still, it was often at the back of my head that he still hadn't.\n\nA few months ago *at least* two years later, he decided to read it. And it was only because he decided to use it for a school project. Excuse me if I think that gives him a bit of a poor record.\n\nRight now, I can think of 11 things I want him to do. And I am certain there are more. I'd like it if he could finish the Hitchhiker's Guide series (since he only read the first 1 or 2), play 5 videogames (though I think I lost one, so maybe 4), read 4 webcomics, and watch 1 short webseries. He has done none of those things. Some have been things I wanted him to do for years, while some are more recent.\n\nIn the last few years, despite the fact that there have been many things I've asked him to do, he has still started a bunch of things on his own. Scratch that, he's gone actively looking for them. Yet, every single thing I want him to do, he says he'll get to \"sometime, when he feels like it.\" I'm pretty sure that's going to be never.\n\nRecently, I did get him to play a videogame. And he *really, really* like it. It was Fire Emblem: Awakening. But of course, he had to take a good thing and turn it into a bad thing. It started with one playthrough. Then it turned into one, but with frequent delays where he started the game again to test things out and do them differently. Now it's his original playthrough that is still unfinished, one on Lunatic difficulty that he's still far from getting through, and a promise of *another* one once he's done where he will min/max character stats. Basically, it's turned into a gigantic waste of time. He spends a ridiculous amount of time playing it, and yet he still seems to go through at a snail's pace. I don't even care about it anymore. \n\nI've gotten him to read the beginnings of all the webcomics I want him to read. For each one, he's thought they were pretty good. And even said that he'll probably read them. He has yet to read any. A couple I've been waiting for for years, the other two for months. He still isn't getting around to it. And what bothers me the most is that he literally does nothing all day.\n\nI'm serious. He's already gone down the rabbit hole of staying up too late every night and taking naps during the afternoon. But he just spends hours each day accomplishing so little. Today, he's made a new Mii Fighter in Smash Bros., then proceeded to literally screw around with it, just running around on stages doing nothing, for hours. He's currently rewatching an episode of a show he's already seen. He also spends a long time checking reddit (even though he still insists he's not really a redditor), checking a forum (and he refreshes it once every ten minutes), and just randomly rereading comics and blog posts he's already seen. He literally thinks about how bored he is, then thinks of some random thing he's already done that he can do, and does it for dozens of minutes. And yet it never occurs to him to do one of the things I want him to do.\n\nRight now, I've been taking a fairly active approach in trying to get him to read some webcomics. As in, reminding him several times a day that it is a thing he could be doing. He's been getting pretty annoyed about it. Says that it's actively making him *not* want to because of how aggravating it is. And he insists that if I just left him alone, he'd get around to it. I don't care when he says that. Because he's constantly demonstrated that no, he won't. Even if it annoys him, bringing it up often will keep it in his mind. Because it never is if I let him be.\n\nAlso, for a while, we had a thing going where I'd watch/do something he wanted me to do, then he'd return the favor. That system worked pretty well because for a while, we were actually decent about it. We weren't super strict, and we tried to actually return the favor. Until he just straight-up stopped. Not once did he ever do something in exchange for me again. Which, of course, led to me getting a bit more strict about it. And naturally, that led to him saying that he never really agreed to it in the first place. Which would obviously happen, because our system was never really meant for strict exchanges. It only worked because we were reasonable. But of course he'd start saying that once I had watched a ton of things he wanted me to watch, with nothing from him.\n\nHe admittedly does do a better job of asking once, then just letting me be. But I feel like that's because I've been much more willing to do things for him. When he asks me to do something and I say I don't feel like it, that's usually meant that I'll do it the next day. And I usually have. But when I ask him to do something and he says he doesn't feel like it, that usually means he's never going to do it. And 97% of the time, he hasn't.\n\nAm I the asshole for bugging him a lot about reading some webcomics?\n\nSorry if I was just rambling or it didn't make sense.\n\nEDIT: Another thing he does is maybe give something a shot *once*, then try dangling that over my head forever. With one webcomic, the one he had the best chance of reading, he once read about 14 pages on his own. Then proceeded to do nothing for weeks/months. But if I bring it up, he always claims he *does* get to things even though it's basically an outlier.",

Since it was before 9 there is a bit of traffic on the way to work but nothing crazy.  The cab drives up the right side and cuts in front of my car.  This is where I honk the horn, as he is only a few inches from hitting my front passenger side bumper.  He of course does the arm waving and flipping the middle finger thing, which ehh I do that myself.  But then looked like he was about to get out of the car when we were stopped on the bridge.

When the light changed again we started to move and as it opened up to two lanes at a T intersection (left lane is left turn only and right lane is right turn only) he did it again to the cars ahead of us and moved into the right lane and then turned left cutting off the cars there.  The cars had stopped to not block the intersection but the light was still green.  \n  \nI called the cab company and had to leave a voice mail for the complaint department.

These are pinned up in the managers office, the staff office and there's a copy behind the CSD. Anyone who wants to check their shifts (or needs to) can go and consult any of these copies at any time. \n  \nA few weeks ago, M asked me on a Friday afternoon if I could cover a Saturday shift, to which I said no. I found it totally unreasonable that I was being expected to cover a shift with less than 12 hours notice, and I wasn't particularly happy that her 'reason' for wanting that day off was 'because I promised my little girl we'd go shopping'. To me, the shift timetable had been up for long enough that if it had been that important, she would have spoken to the line manager and asked not to be put in a shift that day (which is entirely possible, I've done it). I told her this in a polite fashion and advised her gently that if she had availability issues, she needed to go to a manager and actually tell them. \n\n  Skip forward to last two days ago and she seems to be pulling the same thing again. I'm now covering her shift today for what appears to be similar reasons, and I'm not happy as this was supposed to be the start of 4 days of holiday for me. \n\nNow fair enough, things like childcare are an issue, and I can understand if some genuine reason to do with the kids or whatever is an issue, but to me the whole thing looks like she's using this as a trump card, and I'm being expected to give into every demand. magically virtually every other person with children in the store seems to cope just fine. \n\nSo, AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I should add in addition to these two examples, she has done this quite a few times.

I'm the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn't realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: \"Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?\" And then proceeded to bark in that partner's face like an angry dog.\n\nI caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn't immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn't realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.\n\nNow, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it's in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven't spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can't let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.\n\nOK, so here's the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it's starting to show in our daily interactions. I don't really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn't say friendly, and the frequency of our conversations has dropped. And when he interrupts me now, I just keep on talking and bulldoze right over him. This especially has made him notice that something is going on, but since the incident happened a few weeks ago, he has no idea what he did wrong. \n\nI should add that I was brought on board explicitly to add structure/professionalism to the company. We work in a creative field and before I joined the team, it was kind of a crazy, non-productive free-for-all. I've been fairly successful in implementing discipline, but it's been a long and hard fight... Which has resulted in my being labelled as the company nag. This is the main reason why I haven't brought the issue up. It is absolutely vital that I pick my battles.\n\nI also believe that deep-seated sexism isn't something you can talk someone out of.\n\nAm I the asshole for not explaining to my partner how sexist his comment was?\n\nTLDR: Was unable to immediately call out business partner about sexist comment, comment still bothers me, it's starting to creep into our daily interactions, but I still haven't spoken to him about it. Am I being a passive aggressive asshole?\n\nEdit: Changed first sentence to clarify that I am not an office manager, as some readers thought, but a partner.",

    "selftext": "Am I the asshole for thinking that telemarketers do not deserve one instant of courtesy from me?  I answer the phone in a small office and I suffer through easily 20 calls a day by robo-dialing pollsters, telemarketers in call centers, and individual salesmen cold-calling to offer something that is completely unwanted but a company like mine might use.  \n\nPersonally, I think what telemarketers do is save money and enrich themselves at the expense of the general public.  Sure, each individual occurrence is too small to criminalize or prosecute, but a multitude of them can make it unreasonably expensive to pay a staff to answer your business line, or make it insane for useful officers of a business to be reachable directly by phone.  Whether or not there is a Do No Call list, it should be illegal in all forms.  \n\nI have never bought the argument that you shouldn't be rude to them because the person on the phone just needs the money and it's really the boss who should suffer.  Yes, the boss should suffer, but when I think something is wrong, I don't take a job doing it.  I think it's wrong to kick puppies, and if someone offered me $15/hr to kick puppies, I wouldn't do it.  Therefore the instant I know I'm talking to a robo-dialed salesman or pollster, I hang up without a word.  If it's one of those individual dialers who try to fool me into thinking they know the eponymous company owner/CEO (because they read the company name somewhere), I usually get hung up on and called again several times before I can ask in a civil tone that they never call again and explain that the CEO never picks up a call from a party he doesn't know.  Once an individual has redialed enough to have ignored at least one civil request to remove me from the dialing list and later become recognizable to me by voice, I am openly hostile and aggressive to them.  I have eventually told several of them to go fuck themselves with a rusty spike or something similar.  \n\n**TL;DR: So I hang up quickly and am agressively rude to telemarketers.  Am I the Asshole, or is the fact that a selfish nuisance has needled me and made my work ineffective enough to excuse my rage?**\n",

At about an hour and 38 minutes after we order, I don't have my food and everyone else has just part of their food. At this point, I'm perfectly fine; I've been described as freakishly patient. But my friends are quite irate and want to just straight up leave. Although I'm the only one without at least a morsel of food in front of him, I'm not perfectly okay with just walking out. My friend Ernesto flags over our waiter and tells the guy how long we've been waiting and that we won't eat it and asked for the check. The guy just looks down and says \"ok\" (I'm not sure he quite understood us). After he disappears for another 15 minutes, my friends finally convinced me to walk out with them despite the fact that I would have probably waited another hour if necessary. I don't know, I had water and ate some of the complimentary starters that usually come with Korean food but some of us had eaten an appetizer or two. Are we the assholes?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the insight, guys. I'd say collectively, we ate about $8-12 of appetizers so I'm going to find some way to get that money into the right hands. I should have thrown down the $10 I had in my pocket but it slipped my mind. Thanks a diddly!",

    "selftext": "I graduated this college last year. During my time there I started a club (let's call it the \"Cool Kids Club\"). For a club to be recognized by the university it has to meet several steps, one of them is to have a constitution. I wrote the constitution myself and it was adopted into the club. The Cool Kids Club did well in the beginning, but ultimately sputtered out and become unrecognized by the university. \n\nThis year a group of people who still attended the university approached me wanting to restart the Cool Kids Club and asked if they could use my constitution (as well as the Facebook group I made for the club.) I agreed, they adopted it, and the Cool Kids Club was back on. Sweet!\n\nToday there was a post in the Facebook group from the current club president (\"Anthony\") saying that there would be elections for executive board positions at the meeting tomorrow. In the constitution it *clearly* states that elections are to be held \"at the second meeting of Fall quarter.\" This is to allow freshman that want to be involved with the executive board a chance to do so.\n\nThe first reply is from \"Kevin\" who argues in favor of Fall elections, citing the potential Freshman interest. I reply with the part of the club constitution that outlines when elections are to be held. A few people get upset with me commenting, stating things like \"he doesn't even go here\" and \"why are you even posting right now?\"\n\nThere was a significant response from Anthony stating his reasons for wanting the elections now instead of in the Fall, but said he'd be willing to do what the general body wants to do. He also questioned why I was responding to the thread. \n\nMy motives were simple... I just wanted them to follow the constitution. I don't go to the university anymore, but I do know the rules they agreed to follow. Am I the asshole for pointing it out? Some of them seem to think so.",

    "selftext": "TYPO CORRECTION- OBESESSIVE GUY*****\n\nSo yes, I am in high school and this is all just teenage bullshit but I am genuinely concerned. I made friends with a guy at the beginning of freshman year, we bonded over video games and such. He started to become creepy obsessed. he would text me constantly even if I didn't reply, ask where I was if i didn't already tell him. He told me he had some issues with people leaving him, so I promised I wouldn't so long as he didn't turn into a total dick. He did. \n\nI had a boyfriend at first but we broke up and I finally came out that I was single. about a week later I guess he was going to ask me out. (wouldn't have said yes.) a guy that bullied him in middle school I guess beat him to it. I said yes to that guy. well this creepy obsessive guy (let's call him J) got so pissed off that he threw his backpack at a school computer. he got upset at me for saying yes and tried to convince me that my new boyfriend (let's call him D) didn't actually care and just wanted me for bragging rights. J got so weird that I began to ignore him, he would walk around school and stare at me, no matter where I was. His eyes followed me like one of those creepy paintings you see in museums. After I felt I got my space, I began to try and talk to him again because I felt obligated to, I promised I wouldn't leave. \n\nThere was about a 6 month gap that I didn't talk to J. We starred talking more and more and one day he asked to see my tits. I said no, told him to fuck off and to not talk to me again. of course he tried to say it was a test but I just ignored him from then on. He tried to spit on me once, I ignored him then too. He started sending me emails telling me that I was the reason he was suicidal, that I should just die and that no one would miss me. I blocked him. well a few months ago he punched me. I pressed charges and now he is in anger management. \n\nWell Since then, D and I broke up (we were together for about a year and three months) and now he is asking all of my friends if I ever had sex with D or if I have a boyfriend and said he misses the old me. he said I used to be bubbly and apparently kinda slutty. (TOTALLY DISAGREE) and the found out that we at least fooled around (not all the way) and then called me slutty for doing stuff with D. that's not slutty, right? We were together for a long time, especially for high school. He started saying all these things like we were friends and that everything was okay now since I'm single. I told him to fuck off. \n\nI have enough drama at home and I don't need it at school. here's the kicker- He has a prosthetic leg. I had a dream that I went mortal combat on his ass and beat him with it. I told him that. He has pissed me off for so long and tells people that I hate him for no reason and plays the victim for all of it. there are people I don't know that call me a bitch for being this way. I don't know, I feel like I've dealt with it fairly well until threatening to go mortal combat on his ass. But now he keeps telling people he still has a huge crush on me and acts like there's nothing wrong. I have heard I have trouble seeing from anyone else's point of view other than my own.\n\nPlease tell me- am I the asshole in this situation?",

It was one of those crossings with heavy, magnetic gates with lights and sirens and disco balls that automatically lock the fuck up and let you know of the impending doom about 4 minutes  before the actual train comes. Anyway, on the other side of the track is an official-looking white van, and sitting in the front seat is this guy in a fluorescent haz jacket. He's sort of peering at us in a sort of *damned teenagers* sort of way.\n\n\nI had my bike on me, so I let my friend pull the first gate open. I pushed my bike across the track, and waited for my friend to open the second gate for me. He had it open in a shake, and I guess one of my other mates said something funny, because I turned and gave him a smirk. I turned back to push my bike of the crossing and...\n\n'Hey, GET OFF THE TRACKS!'\n\nIt was the guy in the van. He proper screamed it too, like he was nurturing some kind of righteous wrathful flame; like we had killed someone he loved. [High-level rage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dVld6JwgFc)\n\nI was kind of offended. I'm a young person, and my friends and I aren't exactly the smartest-looking group (or should I say the most wealthy-looking... you get the image I'm building here). We get bad looks, we've had people threatening to call the police to kick us out of parks. It's mostly undeserved, and I'll admit I've had to apologise for being too boisterous or loud to a couple of upset parents. But this. Fucking. Guy. Was watching us through his little van window, probably stopwatch in hand, waiting for one of us to simply hesitate on these very empty, very safe railway tracks for two seconds, getting figuartively chubby at the thought of rightfully screaming at a bunch of low-down scum. I bet it made him feel very law-abiding and contributive (contribatory? contributa-tative? contribulory?) to the wellbeing of society to poke his head out of his company van, have a go, and smugly roll his window back up.\n\nSo basically... I got a little mad, I threw some nasty insults around. Half of my mates are reacting typically - 'woooo you showed him... awesome'. The other half are making me feel kind of bad about it - 'he's just doing his job... maybe he saw someone get hit by a train and honestly cares about us'. I'm so mad at the latter group; I think the guy's anger wasn't necessary and was unprofessional. But anyway, that's why I'm here. What do you think?\n\nEDIT: There was no train coming. The gates weren't locked, and the lights weren't going off. The the gates are always closed, because of the spring mechanism that pushes them shut at all times.",

We sit right by each other (our choice since a lot of the kids in there are annoying as fuck) and I often help my sister do her work if she needs help, though I don't do it for her. When neither of us know the answer, we ask the teacher, and it gets resolved. No big deal. I'd say the closest I ever came to doing something for her was doing a full overhaul of her data files for a website, and that's it.\n\nNow this one girl that sits next to her is, in as kind of words as I can say, a dumb and disrespectful bitch. She comes in late every day, leaves early, and acts like miss fucking priss every day. Like many people in our class, she simply begs the teacher every 5 seconds for him to help her, even though the instructions are very clearly printed in our textbook (quite literally spelled out step by step) and even though our teacher literally shows the entire class how to do the work in the front of the classroom. When she doesn't get help, she throws a fucking temper tantrum about it and says \"Well I guess I'll just fail the class then, I don't even care... Not my problem,\" to the teacher and everyone else.\n\nOccasionally, she'll beg me for help when she sees me helping my sister, to which I will look her dead in the eyes and say, \"Do it yourself for once.\" This doesn't happen a lot, but it has happened before. I only really say this because in my mind, if someone is a disrespectful little twat to the teacher and everyone around them, they don't deserve to be waited on hand and foot like that.\n\nIt's also fair to say that I do this to some other people sometimes when they try to copy off my work without asking. This isn't nearly as much as a problem, since they at least try and ask the teacher before creeping up on mine and others' screens.\n\nAnyways, that's my story.

I got up and the conversation went something like this:\n\n*For further clarification, the house we live in is shit. The tumble dryer is located on top of the washing machine, and no matter how hard we try, the thing will rattle and push itself up against the wall outside my door, and shake into the wall constantly until it is finished.

Can you put the underwear you need dried out to air tonight, and then use the tumble dryer in the morning? It'll be dry by the morning.\"  \n**Upstairs room-mate:** \"No, it needs to be dried in this tumble dryer.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo she proceeds to start it for 50 minutes, and goes upstairs. I turn it off as soon as she leaves, and get back into bed. A minute or so later, I hear her come down and start it again. I go outside and so begins the argument where she says that I can keep turning it off, but she will continue to turn it on again. Eventually, I decide to just let her win and I lay awake for the entire time the dryer is banging against my wall. \n\nCut to 6.30am, and I hear her come downstairs and run the machine AGAIN for another half an hour. Now I'm completely sure this was out of spite. I get up, go to turn off the dryer and suddenly a great idea comes to me. I locate the fuse box in the house and flick the switch which controlled the power to the sockets. I went back to sleep peacefully, to the sounds of her trying to find out why her spin stopped.\nPlease note, the fuse-box switches did not affect the fridge and freezer or such, I checked before going back to bed.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

The night before getting pierced I gave my boyfriend - who was in London for a language training week at that time - a heads up via WhatsApp. I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but his only response was along the lines of \"Well... if you think you'll look prettier :)\" Suprisingly positive, so I figured he'd be okay with it. I went ahead with it and got my ear pierced (conch and rook in case that's relevant).\n\nThe next day I visited my boyfriend. I had my hair in a ponytail, so the piercings were clearly visible. He didn't comment on them at all though, so I figured they didn't bother him too much. Turns out he didn't even notice them...\n\nFast forward a week: my boyfriend is staying at my place. I notice him staring at my new piercings. \"What the hell is that? Are those the new piercings? Why?\" and a few minutes later \"I can't even tell you how much I don't like them\" He's devastated. And I mean literally. He pleaded with me to take them out for about 10 minutes, after I refused he proceeded to sulk for good 30 minutes. I asked him why he didn't object before I got my piercings done, since if I took them out now the money I paid for them and the pain of a needle piercing through my ear would all have been for nothing. His response was \"Well, I was in London at that time...\"\n\nWhatever... I figured I'd just keep my hair down when he was aroud now, because if he can't see the piercings he's not going to complain about them, right? Well, not really... It worked for a while, but we were cuddling this morning and he pressed his head against my ear unintentionally. I said \"Ouch, you touched my piercings\" which sent him in sulk mode all over again. I decided that I wouldn't waste my Saturday by staying at my sulking boyfriends place. Before I left he said \"Get home safely. Oh, and I don't like that entire piercing thing at all\" \"Well yeah, I noticed\"\n\nThat's pretty much the whole story. And we're both 18 in case that's relevant. Am I the asshole here?",

    "selftext": "So, started apartment hunting last November and found a place by December. Myself and 3 friends went and toured the place and it was pretty fantastic, so we all signed a lease. We asked a lot of questions along the way like what kind of appliances, upgrades, etc. The collected info was that: upgraded apartments come with fridge w/ice maker, surface stoves, track lighting, updated bathrooms, plank flooring, and I think that's it. They waived our application fees, and let my friend and I split a $600 pet fee/deposit since we have two small pets (two 15lb dogs) making it $300 per person in pet fee/deposit. We move in in May! (except for one guy, he moves in August) w/ rent @ $409 a month.\n\nJanuary rolls around and I went ahead and paid $1936 (4 months rent plus pet fee/deposit) in advance for May through August. About a month before we were supposed to move in, I called to ask what apartment number I was supposed to go, or when that info would be available for us. They said they'd call and let us know about 2 weeks before move in. All righty! Two weeks before move in I call and say hey, we were wondering if you guys knew which apartment number yet and this person said well, we will just tell you what apartment you have when you get here, we don't normally call people and tell them two weeks in advance.\n\nI kind of start to get annoyed here, but it's not bad by any means. It's just I'm not going to move somewhere without knowing what apartment number beforehand. What if I was moving a considerable distance? What if I get there and they forgot? It just didn't seem okay to me, but maybe I was being picky/bitchy about it. My friend called back and asked the same thing, this time finding out we could fill out a maintenance request and find out. \n\nAbout 2 days later we find the apartment number out, so my friend and I go there and find the building, walk around etc to check it out. The door was open because they had just painted/were working on the apartment so we peeked in but din't walk in. The floors were pretty dirty, and the stove was yellowed-old. We were kind of upset, but I told my friend ya know maintenance is clearly still working on this place so let's wait till we move in before we get upset about anything over nothing. The next day another one of our friends says hey, the door is unlocked so I went and checked it out-- so naturally I went and checked it out too but I only had about 5 minutes and my main focus was bedrooms (we hadn't picked yet). They had replaced the stove but it was still an older model (looks pretty much new but the lettering is worn off the burner knobs and it's a much older model of stove with no clock or timer etc). I didn't notice much else about the apartment, it was towards the end of the day with low light and like say I was in a rush. Again, I'm thinking they've still got 2-3 days before we move in so we'll wait and see.\n\nThey call us the day before we move in at like 6PM and say hey, you're going to have to wait until 1PM to move in so maintenance can do one last check over on the apartment. I mean, you guys are kind of taking half a day away from me but if maintenance is working hard to make sure that bitch is right, so be it, I understand. May is a weird time of year to move in college students.\n\nWe get there next day, get our keys, and start moving in. The place wasn't really... fully cleaned. There are paint spots and scuffs all over the flooring, dust and shit-- we're going to have to totally clean the floors. No icemaker in the fridge, porch light doesn't work, one of the bathroom light switches doesn't work, an air vent is really loose (And it's right above a desk so like, it's pretty dangerous), and the only upgrade here is the flooring really. Like, what the hell? The door to the bedroom I wanted is locked, so we go back to the office and ask if we can get it unlocked and they say yeah, maintenance will come by sometime today to get it. Well I mean fuck, I already had to wait till 1PM and I'm really pissed off at this point. I go back and talk to my mom about it, my concern being that I might just be super bitchy/nitpicky because I'm pretty stressed over finals and she's like fuck no let me go talk to them. My mom is really loud and firm. It's super intimidating and she comes off like a total bitch if you don't know her.\n\nWe go down to the office again and she's like \"Yeah, I wanna speak to a manager now.\" Meantime, another friend is there getting her keys to the new apartment as well. The property manager comes out and starts asking whats wrong and my mom starts forcefully explaining. At the same time, there's confusion for my friend getting the keys, she is the roommate that also has a dog so when she goes to write a check for first months rent they are like \"yeah, the pet fee is $600\" and we explained that the property manager let us half it. We find out then that the property manager that signed us on has been fired, and left no record of that agreement (Our lease was supposed to be changed to reflect that but it never was). The new property manager says she will \"honor the agreement\" though I didn't think that was a very big deal considering that was what was supposed to happen anyways-- you're not exactly doing me a favor here lady (and remember, I've already paid this pet fee/deposit so I have a receipt to prove it not to mention like 5 witnesses on the verbal agreement). The new property manager comes down with us to the apartment to check out all the issues. As soon as she walks in she says \"Ohhh, this is a partially upgraded unit.\" We start feeling a lot better because it's like oh all right, so it's not that no one gave a shit, it's just the wrong type of apartment (there was no previous mention of partially upgraded apartments, and still isn't on their official paperwork. We asked for the fully upgraded model so it'd be just like the one we toured because we really liked it). She says she will lets us have this apartment at a regular apartment rate of $384 per month to make up for it (so $25/month less but we get upgraded flooring) plus she will help us make sure everything is fixed, etc. We all reluctantly agree (super tired from moving, it's finals week, and I'm sick) that something like that will probably work since none of us want to move again.\n\nThat night we go check out a friends apartment (same apartment complex) and they have the true regular apartment. It's the same price $384/month but doesn't have the upgraded flooring and thats literally it. though, they have cushioned bar chairs which we would really like (ours aren't cushioned) since we plan on using the bar a lot. The condition otherwise is about the same, but again, our upgraded floors are dirty, covered in paint speckles, and scuffed quite a bit.\n\nWe continue moving and find other details like one of the bedroom doors is totally broken and doesn't shut/wiggles like a pool noodle, the freshly painted walls were painted pretty lazily (you can tell they just painted over dust etc, marks on walls, dent/scuffs here and there-- not bad looking walls by any means though). After a night's sleep, we get up saturday and start moving lots of shit, and got a lot done. Feeling a bit better about it all, we get another nights rest and we are all feeling really good about it Sunday. Friends are heading back to work/studying for finals and I start unpacking my room. I quickly discover the internet absolutely sucks. It's included with the apartment but their website literally says \"Fastest Internet In \"the city\" Has Just Landed At \"the apartment complex\" \" so when I run speed test and pull a sweet, savory 6 Mbps (my max rated speed, with intermittent 100Mbps \"boosts\" as needed) I'm more than pissed off. I'm ready to break my lease pissed off. It's physically impossible to watch 1080p video continuously with this connection. I'm an electrical engineering student and do a LOT on my computer, I had hoped on living here for the next 2-4 years and I literally/physically can't with internet like that. We debate looking at buying an internet package through comcast or something and splitting it but agree if we have to do that we will be demanding a deduction from our rent since we aren't using their internet because it's literally unbearable. However, I note to everyone that I'm super pissed and tired and probably much more bitchy than I should be about it all. I made a list of everything that needed to be fixed, that we were promised, and how we felt about it all together so I could go talk to the property manager today (we haven't worked out resigning the leases yet so I needed to stop by anyways).\n\nThis morning, I felt all right. Still pretty upset over the internet, but overall decent. I head down to the office planning on having a 10-15 minute chat with the manager about all our things and it ends up being more like 2 minutes. She tells me I'll have to do a maintenance request on all the broken things in the apartment, we can't do anything about the internet, we can't switch out our bar chairs and we they'll remake the lease and we can come sign it at our convenience. Now, the internet is much better today so I don't feel nearly as bad, and if it stays this good I'll be happy but other residents are saying it's pretty much shit all the time. Honestly, here's how we felt:\n\n* There's a new property manager, the other one got fired for whatever bad thing, and May is a weird time for us to move in, we get that.\n\nHowever...\n\n* This apartment is not what we signed a lease for, not fully cleaned, clearly not checked over (it feels like they forgot we were moving in to be honest and just threw some shit together) and there are a lot of little things adding on to the pile of disappointment and frustration.\n\nAs far as we're concerned, this apartment complex has broken this lease with us, and that's rude/insulting/maybe illegal and wants us to just accept the apartment at a slightly lower price and be quiet about it like we owe them something. We feel like they need to make it up to us more than that. I'll be honest, we like the apartment pretty well. I mean for $384 a month, it's pretty bitchin'. Though, there is an almost identical apartment literally a mile away (their main competitor) that has the same pricing and amenities but they are brand new (though they don't allow pets, which sucks). But even if we wanted to go there we can't now, because we expected this apartment to work out (not to mention tired from moving, finals, sick, etc as well as most apartments have their leases filled out now). So ultimately, we're fucking stuck here.\n\nTyping this out has been really helpful for me, I think, just to lay it all out somewhere and especially if anyone care to read through this huge fuckin' wall of text and give me your much valued opinion.\n\nAt this point we'd feel fantastic about it all if they:\n\n* Fix the broken shit (this has to fucking happen)\n* Pay to have these floors cleaned (I'm pretty firm on this happening)\n* Switch the bar stools we want (I'm pretty firm on this happening)\n* Updated stove (This would be nice, though the stove is already nice so it's not a huge deal)\n* Do something about the slow internet (whether it be let us get our own and deduct from our rent or upgrade the existing Pavlov shit)\n\nWe feel like this isn't really too unreasonable, things considering, but I would love to see other people's opinion before I send my property manager an email about it. I haven't gone over this for clarity/typos, so apologies for that. And seriously, thanks again for reading, this was a lot of shit.",

    "selftext": "Ok so like a week and a half ago my girlfriend told me that she was gonna be receiving her LNA license after a semester of work at a local community college. She wanted me to take time off of work but I told her that she shouldn't count on me going because it's hard to find someone to cover your shift where I work. Well it turned out that I didn't have to work on the day of her graduation, which was this past Wednesday at 6 PM. Even so I told her that I wasn't 100% certain that I could go as I didn't want to disappoint her if something came up. \n\nOn Tuesday my Dad went to court to fight a reckless driving case and lost. He won't get his license back until July. He then called me and asked if I could drive him around and work with him Wednesday. He is a welder and makes most his money off of traveling around the area and welding people's trucks, boats, etc. I really didn't wanna leave my dad hanging so I said yes. We worked from 7 AM to around 5PM Wednesday (the day of my girlfriend's license receiving if you're not paying attention) and by 5 I was bone tired. I texted my GF and she asked me what I had been doing all day. So I explained and told her that I was extremely tired. She said that it would be alright if I didn't go. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. After that she stopped replying for the rest of the day, not unusual since she was probably busy. Early Thursday morning I texted her and got nothing but crickets. When she did reply she was pissed off that I didn't show up and said that she didn't care that I was tired and that she just wanted me to be there. We had a fight about it and now she's more pissed off than before I think. The thing is, if she had said no when I asked her if she was sure I absolutely would've gone. \n\nWhat say you reddit? \n\n**Update: My girlfriend came over and after talking for awhile we decided that it's best if we don't see each other anymore. For the reason above and others.**\n\nEdit: Those who say I'm an asshole, how should I go about remedying my fuck up?",

    "selftext": "So first I'll give you some background. I am a 22yr old male about to graduate college. This happened yesterday, mothers day, at work. I work at a restaurant in downtown chicago, and for those of you who don't know, mothers day is our second busiest day of the year, so I already wasn't in the best mood.  \n\nI work with my roommate and my girlfriend, me and my roommate work in the same section, and my girlfriend works as a hostess on the other side of the restaurant. There are 3 other important people in this story, coworker 1 (C1), coworker 2 (C2), and chef. \n\n\nSo now to actually start the story. It was a hectic day at work and we had two new people working, which just made matters worse. When I first showed up I saw my roommate and gf whispering to each other, saying something like \"did you tell him yet?\". Me, knowing they were talking about me, asked them what they were talking about, and they just changed the subject. This happened about 1-2 more times that day, but I just kicked it to the back of my mind, as that day was very busy\n\n I could go into all the garbage I went through at work that day, but I will skip it to be concise. Basically, I wasn't in the best of moods at this time, but things were dying down and I was looking forward to leaving. I went in the back, and C1, my roommate, and the chef were all laughing in the back. When C1 saw me he shouted \"dumbass got her pregnant!\" my roommate then told him \"no she didn't tell him yet!\" At this point I was beginning to get flustered, and the chef and C1 were telling me what I should have done not to get my girlfriend pregnant, with C1 telling me what a big mistake it was when he had a baby at my age.\n\nThey continued to grill me, but I just stood there and took it, as there was someone up front I was helping get food for. I went back up front and took care of the customer, and my mind started racing with thoughts. Is she really pregnant? Why did she tell everyone else first? Needless to say, I start to freak out a bit. The only time me and her had talked about kids is when we talked about how much we don't like and don't want them. So I called her over, and the conversation went like this.\n\nMe: \"So people have been saying some things about you, is there anything you need to tell me?\"\n\nHer: \"Maybe\"\n\n*At this point my heart starts pounding, this isn't looking good*\n\nMe: \"well what does that mean? If you have something to tell me you can just tell me\"\n\nHer: \"not at work\"\n\n*I'm starting to freak the fuck out, the only reason she wouldn't want to tell me at work is if it was something serious.* \n\nMe: \"does it have to do with\" *points to uterus*\n\nHer: \"yes\"\n\n*my eyes grow wide, my hands start shaking, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack*\n\nMe: \"are you pregnant?\"\n\nHer: \" yes, I'm pregnant\"\n\nI take a step back, as my brain starts to process the gravity of what she just said. I feel the adrenaline kicking through my body, I have no idea how to respond. I'm staring at her wide-eyed, when my roommate jumps out from behind the door, and they both scream\" surprise!\". This does not help with my anxiety, as my heart beats faster. My gf then says \" just kidding I wasn't really pregnant!\". My roommate \"yeah we got you!\". My mouth is open, blood is kicking and I cannot make words come out of my mouth. I say,\"I need to be alone right now\". I then go to the bathroom to try and calm down, be alone, and process. This feels like the start to a panic attack, but I calm myself down a little bit and go back up front. \n\nThere was a customer up there looking to place an order and throughout the conversation my words aren't coming out right, and I'm still flustered. When I hand him my pen to sign the check, I bump into him  because I can't controll my hand. I am obviously not calmed down yet. I go to the back and my roommate attacks me. \"Why are you being so weird?\", \"you should have known it was just a joke\", \"quit being a bitch\". To which I respond shut the fuck up, don't tell me how to feel, and you almost gave me a panic attack. He keeps trying to get in my face to force me to calm down, which was making me even more upset, and I tell him to watch upfront because I need to be alone right now, and cool off.\n\nAs I am going towards the bathroom again, my girlfriend intercepts me. \"Did I ever tell you how much I adore you?\" I can still feel the adrenaline pumping through me, and I just stare at her. She goes in to hug me and I am still freaking out, but I try to hug her back, which turns into a weird half hug. She gets upset with me and storms off. \n\nI then go back into the bathroom and cool off for about fifteen minutes, which helps, and then go back to finally finish my shift. I look for my gf to talk this out, but she already went home. Great. now she's mad at me. I later learn that this whole joke was orchestrated by C2, but it was supposed to go like this.\n\nHer: \"why haven't you wished me a happy mothers day?\"\n\nMe: \"why would I?\"\n\nHer:\"because I'm pregnant!\"\n      \"just kidding!\"\n\n When I got off of work, I texted saying sorry that I got upset, but I was so flustered I couldn't say anything. no reply. So tell me, am I the asshole for responding how I did?\n\nTL;DR: coworkers and girlfriend pretend she is pregnant, I almost have a panic attack, turns out they were just kidding. Now everyone is mad at me.\n",

    "selftext": "I want to know if I'm the asshole in a fight that my boyfriend of three years and I are currently having. \n\nA little background: I just had a baby three weeks ago and am currently taking care of her mostly on my own while my boyfriend works and breastfeeding every two hours. I have mostly been camped out on the couch. Normally, I am working and my boyfriend has plenty of time alone to masturbate, and I have recently been privy to his habits a little more than I'm used to. I try to be understanding, since I am currently unable to have sex until six weeks postpartum. I am not against masturbation in any way - I masturbate and think it's healthy. I am, unfortunately, slightly bothered by porn use. I don't like to admit it, but it does irk me a little when I know he's whacking it to porn (he gets up in the middle of the night to do it). I have never said anything about it in the past, because I know guys are visual and masturbation is a different, more personal thing than having sex with your partner. He has a very high sex drive. I have also tried to continue being intimate with him and have given him a few blow jobs, maybe two a week or so, since coming home from the hospital. We normally have sex nearly every day. I am exhausted as well as sexually frustrated.\n\nThis morning I had to take the baby to the doctor. He knew this, but he was unsure of the time I was leaving. I was nursing her on the couch and he came out of the bedroom to get the laptop and went back into the bedroom, announcing that he was going to masturbate. This bothered me and I said in a frustrated tone, \"I'm leaving in an hour!\" thinking he could just wait until I left, which would be preferable for me because I don't really like sitting in the adjacent room awake while he masturbates, but also, I thought, to him, because he wouldn't have to feel bad about me sitting out there, he could have the sound on, or whatever.\n\nHe gets upset and I get upset back. I said, angrily, that he could just wait for me to leave and have time to masturbate to his favorite porn star all day! We argue and I leave, and I've been stewing all day about how selfish and insensitive he is. I say that he can be more sensitive to how I feel about him masturbating whenever and wherever since I am sexually frustrated and exhausted taking care of a baby and he says I have no right to tell him when or where to masturbate or what to do with his body. \n\nHe is also stuck on the fact that I don't like porn and is now saying I don't want him to masturbate ever, which isn't true. He says I can't say I don't want him to masturbate in the room next to me while I'm awake and then also say I'm okay with masturbation. He also says since I've never said anything about him masturbating to porn bothering me before that I am a liar and have not been upfront in our relationship. In reality, I have asked him to clear the history because I don't like to see what he masturbates to. I feel my dislike of porn use is irrational, so mostly I ignore it. I have never told him not to use porn and don't expect that from him at all... I just don't like thinking about him jerking it in the room next to me while I'm sitting there!\n\nHopefully this makes some sense - I probably rambled a little too much. So, am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "My work situation is kind of weird, and I've been having some issues with it. I work for my grandfather's company- he's the CEO and my mother is the general manager. I work in a separate department under a different manager, but my mom oversees everyone so she's ultimately my boss. I've been there 5 years and I cover not only my own job description but a myriad of other duties that I've taken over that fall outside my department, and I report to my mother a lot of the time- so although I answer to my manager as far as our department is concerned, I'm not just an employee, if that makes sense.\n\nMy manager has only been at the company for 6 months. She's a nice enough lady, but she's very distracting. We have a policy against personal phone calls unless its necessary- that's what your breaks are for. Texting isn't a problem as long as work is finished, because it isn't distracting to everyone else like chatting at your desk tends to be. The problem is my manager easily takes 3 or 4 (sometimes more) personal phone calls a day. It's not just quick questions either- the shortest are 2 or 3 full minutes and there have been times where it has been up to 15. There are only 3 people in my department, so we're all in the same office. As such her phone calls get very, very distracting. Hearing it pulls me right out of whatever I'm doing, especially when it's mundane bullshit about dinner plans. Conversely, I VERY rarely take calls at the office and the few times I have to, I leave the room. It seems disrespectful and unprofessional to me to subject people to my personal life. I've mentioned it to my mother previously, but she referred me to my grandfather. He just kind of shook the issue off.\n\nToday after one of my manager's calls I asked her nicely if she might be able to take personal calls to the boardroom when she gets them- its literally right in the next office over. I explained that I find it difficult to concentrate with chatter. Regardless of the policy we have I don't care what she does or how often she takes calls- I just have a lot of work to do and it makes it harder to focus hearing her go on and on. She said \"What, so all I'm allowed to do in here is work? Is that what you're telling me?\" and got really defensive about it. I tried explaining that it's just too distracting, but she got passive-aggressive about it and we didn't get anywhere. When I said good night before leaving, she didn't say a word to me. I told my mom and grandfather what happened and they just shook their heads and chuckled at me, so they weren't opposed to what I did- they just don't want to be involved.\n\nI try to be personable as much as possible, but at the end of the day I'm not there to make friends or coddle people's feelings. I am there to work and keep the company strong. That's it. If I am being distracted from that objective, I don't see anything wrong with respectfully speaking up and asking for someone to meet me halfway. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

While my parents have been together for the entirety of my existence, it was a very toxic affair, with a suite of emotional and substance abuse disorders between them. I spent my childhood alternating between being yelled at by my drunk dad, consoling him through drunken tears, and having all of my after-school time consumed because he couldn't stand to be alone. Alongside this, my mother has been famously critical and incisive to my father and I (some drama bullshit about paternity, past lovers, etc.) It'd be fair to say at the very least that they were people with anxious and depressive disorders.\n\nI'd say I came out pretty well-composed considering, but I obviously struggle with those disorders now in turn, and I've made friends who were depressive as well. Now I differ from these friends in that they are 'diagnosed,' while I have never been to therapy (financial differences.) My diagnosed friends seem to be incredibly focused on their disorders, prepared to use them as tools of rationalization for any and all failures in their lives. They're also the type who think the only real advice comes from a therapist.\n\nNow my dad came down with a kidney disease that stopped the drinking, so his sadness was aired out raw. In those years, I dropped everything to nurse him. Quit school, no job, full time nurse. I tried so hard to monitor his diet, studied nutrition in my free time, tried to figure out how he could nourish smarter. Changed my own habits and tried to encourage good decisions but he just couldn't be asked to try. Eventually he OD'd on prescription meds and died.\n\nNow I am still out of school and I work to support my mother, who has been unemployed for years. She seems to have developed even more disorders, and more or less refuses to leave the house/apply for jobs/even do real work on the internet. I know there's something kicking around in there, whatever the official disorders are.\n\nThe kicker is that, I come here and I get on the internet and you see nothing but sympathy for mental illness. \"The depressed need your help,\" as the narrative goes, and they deserve your sympathy. It's *so hard for them.* Nevermind if you lay out everything you know for them, pledge to help them, offer support, offer suggestions, encourage them, bend over backwards and fellate them to satisfy their absolutely nonexistent self-esteem. Nothing works, and more often than not, they don't try. \"I want to do X,\" they might say. \"X is right here. Do it right now,\" you might say. \"I can't,\" they say.\n\nBull, fucking, shit.\n\nYou live this life and you endure your struggles and there's always someone with hand outstretched looking for more of your time and sympathy. \"I don't think you're trying in good faith, I think you want an easy fix.\" \"Well *my therapist said...*\"\n\nI know this post is getting heated but, I am just so sick of having this be the common theme of my life. I'm sick of trying, I'm sick of tolerating, and I'm sick of having my efforts to help get rebuffed, with no appreciation and certainly no reciprocation. I loathe that all of this sympathy only gets allotted to the vocal sufferers, that those with their own problems who eat the cost of others' shortcomings are marginalized and insolently asked to be more empathetic.\n\nAnd yet, from the technical perspective, yeah. This is a failure of my empathy. I might call it a justified one, but a failure nonetheless.\n\nSo please, reddit. Am I the Asshole for losing my tolerance for mental illness?",

    "selftext": "There's no real fight here to resolve.  I just want to know if I'm unreasonable.  \n\nI work in a high-end department store i.e. (*Tiffany's or Shreve, Crump, and Lowe*) located in a 150 year old building.  We're 6 floors tall, one of which is a manufacturing area where we make some of the wares.  There's machinery, chemicals, fumes, and salty workers on that floor who occasionally discuss at a shout which one of the others can go fuck himself and whether or not Tony Romo is a fag.  A bunch of people involved in the manufacturing have to come and go from this floor throughout the day, are usually pretty grimy and they use a stairwell in the back of the store (right by a back entrance).  \n\nBecause we don't want customers to go anywhere near this area, we provide an elevator in the front of the store that goes to every other floor, but not the factory unless you have a key.  The sales staff is dressed formally, and the customers are usually dressed well.  The stairwell is behind an \"employees only\" door and isn't easy to find.  So, you don't even know it exists unless you ask for special treatment.\n\nSomehow, when they find out there is an elevator that takes them to the upper floors, 1 out of 20 shoppers *have* to ask if there's a staircase they can use instead.  We used to assume some people were claustrophobic or feared elevators and led them through the stairway as a courtesy.  Eventually, it became clear that the majority of people asking for the stairs were only doing so because they want \"the exercise\".  So we started explain to whoever asked that there is a stairway that goes through a maintenance area, but it's really not suitable for the public, which is why we provide the elevator.  Virtually all of them say they'd rather take the stairway anyway.  So I just let them do it and hope no one rubs their Chanel pantsuit against a wall that the 1st shift smeared with grime when they left an hour ago.  \n\nShould I tolerate this?  I don't think I owe these people a workout, and it doesn't make sense to have people there.  If I walked into Walmart and asked the greeter where the guns are, should I also be able to expect him to provide me with a weight belt so I can bang out some weighted squat thrusts on the way there...or would that make me an asshole?\n\n**TL:DR** My store provides a clean, convenient elevator for well dressed customers and sales staff, but some people have to upset the balance to get in a workout by climbing stairs unless you aggressively refuse them.  We're running a store, not a gym.  Am I right to think they're being stupidly unreasonable?!",

    "selftext": "So on March 30th of this year, I stayed up until around 4 am. This was of course for no other reason than to help my current SO's ex manage his feelings for her. \n\nThis was about a week before her and her ex were going to go to a System of a Down concert in London, where they'd be sharing a room too. For clarity we'll call the ex \"John\" and the girlfriend \"Jane\". \n\nSo it's around 1 AM on March 30th(technically April 1st by then), John has started talking to me of all people about how he still has feelings for her and he explains to me in the most sincere and apologetic and overall nicest way you could imagine that he thinks Jane has feelings for him too, and he's worried about things happening because he doesn't want to 'betray' me. \n\nNo problems there, I, as I think would be reasonable in the situation get a bit sad and worried as I already had some kinda large problems with worrying about losing Jane. I don't want to get too involved so I tell Jane I feel upset for no real reason and she understands and tries to help me feel better. \n\nOver the few hours this sadness increases as I get more and more worried of the idea of things going more than a bit bad for me. John eventually reveals the information that he wants Jane and him to share a bed. I don't want to get annoyed at him for risk of making things worse, so I try to encourage him to reconsider. \n\nAt around 3:30 AM, he stops responding for about 20 minutes. I ask him why he's AFK. He responds with the message: \"APRIL FOOOLS LOLOLOL\". \n\nI call him a cunt and go to sleep feeling more than slightly betrayed and tricked. No problems there. I talk to Jane about what happened, she says she knows.\n\nWait - how could she have known? Oh yes, because none other than my most trusted companion was in on it. More than this, she suggested it. This doesn't make me angry or annoyed, this just makes me really fuckin sad. So I take a day off my computer and sleep the rest of the day.\n\nOver a month later I still feel upset when speaking to John and I cant help but forget the April Fools joke. I decide to talk to Jane about it to help conclude things a bit better than last time when both of us just ignored that it happened and moved on. \n\nJane tells me I'm overreacting and that it was just a joke. I ask her to if nothing else understand why I am upset about it. She says she can't understand it, and she just wanted to see how I'd react in that situation, and says \"fuck you you're making me feel like a bad person\". Keep in mind, I love her more than anything still but that situation as a whole hurt not only my feelings but also my friendship with John. \n\nAm I a prick for holding onto it this much?

    "selftext": "So this happened in the last few days; my husband, other cousins, my Mom and aunt are backing me up. What I want to know is what others have to say about this whole situation. I've never had any real bouts with family so, I'm feeling a bit caught off guard about all of this, if nothing else.\n\nSo here's what happened:\n\nMy Grandpa passed away recently (early April), relatively unexpectedly and tragically. I booked an emergency flight home from abroad as soon as I had news about funeral arrangements. I was home for about a week, just enough time to get settled in at home, be there for the funeral and spend sometime with family. Even though I had just been back in the States two weeks prior for a planned visit, original plans were suddenly changed with the deterioration in my grandpas health, landing him in the hospital twice in the last week and a half.\n\nLet me back up in potential build-up of drama by stating the following:\n\nOnce the news of his death came to me, having waited overnight, not to mention giving myself a chance to calm down as the news was hard to take as I was very close to my Grandpa, and he was my last grandparent, I changed my Facebook profile to the original picture of a 1952 portrait of my grandparents I have tattooed on my shoulder blade. I also changed my profile banner to a picture of my Grandpa with two of my favorite cousins and I during the last time I was in Georgia with my family (2008, the spring after my Grandma, his wife, has passed from Alzheimer's). Going to GA for Easter used to be a family tradition up until I'd say the last 12 years ago or so. Since then, it has become much more sporadic because of my Grandparents health slowly deteriorating as they aged (and public schools spring break not lining up with Easter any more).\n\nAnyway, moving on: shortly after changing my pictures, my aunt Tami (married to my Mom's brother), sent me a message that said \"OP:... My son doesn't know yet.\" To which I asked if she wanted me to change them. She said yes. I didn't.\n\nInstead, I replied that I didn't see what the problem was. I didn't post a status / any words about what had happened. I simply changed my pictures. I also noted that I wasn't even friends with her son on FB. She retaliated that there was still GA family that didn't know about what had happened and that FB wasn't the place for them to find out. I agreed, but reaffirmed that I only changed my pictures specifically for that reason. *No further correspondence.*\n\nThe weekend after the funeral, the family began work on Grandpas house to get it ready to put up for sale on the open market. As we began to start clearing it out for renovations, the majority of the family was there making piles of trash, donation, and keep. Having recently moved 4,000+ miles away to Germany, I opted not to keep much of anything save for a few sentimental items:\n* Good Housekeeping cookbook 1969 (containing a few recipies I knew him and Grandma used)\n* Family Genealogy book\n* Military uniform, ribbons and medals\n* Letters from Grandpa to Grandma while in the AF stationed in Germany circa August - February 1952 (my other cousin, Britt, kept the remainder of the stack of letters from 1953 and 1969).\nI wanted to keep his military photo album too, but Mom said not yet. Of the few things I kept, I went through the house checking with every member of my family that they did not want the items I wanted. I always asked my uncle Mike first, as he was the eldest remaining child. No one had any objections.\n\nA few days after the clean up, I left to come back to my new home across the pond. Not a week after being back, my Mom was messaging me telling me not to be surprised if Tami sends me a message asking for Grandpas military medals. Confused, she explained that Tami and her daughter Sarah, wanted to make a special memorial display of the flag presented to Mike at the funeral and include Grandpa's original military medals and ribbons in his honor as a gift to Mike for Father's Day.\n\nUpon request (and without my knowledge), my Mom told Tami that she had the medals, but that they meant a lot to me and she would check with me before letting her have them. She also suggested to get duplicate medals and ribbons from and army surplus store. Unfortunately, this solution is not favorable by the requesting party. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I did not receive any correspondence from Tami.\n\nFast-forward to just the other day:\nMy cousin Sarah (Mike and Tami's daughter), sent me a message again requesting Grandpas military medals and ribbons. She noted that her dad \"didn't ask for much when we were cleaning the house since he was just trying to hold it together.\" I responded cordially stating that I think the display is a wonderful and thoughtful gift idea for her father, but that I feel it is important the original medals and ribbons stay with his original uniform. I reinforced the purchase of duplicate medals and ribbons for Mike's display, as I wanted to make a shadow box display of my own showcasing Grandpas military memorabilia, and that it would look weird with new medals and an old uniform. Furthermore, I suggested incorporating his service certificates (which Mike actually *DID* want) into the display. Sarah said in her response message to me that she was, \"not trying to take Grandpas things from [me but is] trying to do something for [her] dad who's having a hard time.\" I replied to her, that I only took a total of 4 items the day of the initial clean and that while she isn't \"trying\" to take something from me, she *would* be taking a huge part of the 1 out of 4 things I have to remember our Grandpa by. I concluded the message by saying \"I hope you understand.\"\n\nHer only response: \"I don't at all.\"\n\nA few minutes later, she posts a status that says \"Wow how my eyes have been opened over the last month and a half!\" I \"liked\" it out of irony. She immediately sends me a message that says, \"Do me a favor and don't like my status. Delete me if you want. I just don't care anymore.\" One of her friends commented with concern about what the status was about. She replied simply stating \"People who only think about themselves.\" Clearly, the status is about me (should I make a point here that I am considerably younger than her?).\n\nI didn't condone her messages with a response but rather, a lack of action or response. \n\nWell Reddit, that's what happened. No words since. I'm not sure how to feel about this. Mostly I want to say \"fuck it,\" but I can't seem to let it go because 1) This is surprising to me and 2) Grandpa wouldn't want this and it makes me sad.\n\nStill though, I keep having to fight the urge to say something to her \n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE HERE?!",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR exgf/best friend wants to fuck one of my other best friends STILL, I'd want to stop being friends**\n\nMe &amp; my exgf have had a rocky road to now, we went on-and-off for a bit after she cheated on me (I know, I shouldn't have taken her back but it's not about that right now) until now where we're pretty firmly separated but honestly still friends, best friends really. \n\nAs a high schooler, I have three close friends; Connor, Allan, and Austin. We'd all been friends since elementary school, and I was elated that my new gf fit in so seamlessly with all of us. Soon after I introduced her to them, however, she started flirting with Allan. It didn't faze me at first first because it seemed harmless and I thought I had nothing to worry about (obviously very wrong), but while we were together she became *very* insistent on us having a threeway with him, how it was her ultimate fantasy, all this &amp; that. I told her that I'd possibly open to the idea of an MMF threesome but that I'd want to try with an MFF first (she's very sexually experienced and had already had both, whereas I was markedly less so). This always turned into a gripe about how it wasn't fair, how we'd never find a girl, how we could just find a girl after, but I was always fairly stern on my position that I didn't want to jump into something I didn't feel comfy with.\n\nNow here's the thing about Allan since shortly after I got with my gf, he's moving to another province this summer. I'd always said I would go down and visit him the next summer after we graduate and then he could come back to Ontario with me &amp; whoever came along (usually we'd say it was my gf and my first best friend). But this timer really stuck with her, *\"We can just do it before he goes so we won't have to deal with him after\"* or *\"We're gonna lose our chance and it'll be for nothing\", so she always just nailed it in because I suppose in her mind she knew eventually she'd run out of time.\n\nAfter we first got back together, it didn't take her long to start bringing the threeway back up. I thought it was kind of fucked up that I'd just taken her back after she fucked some random dude and she was already begging me for a threesome with another guy, one of my best friends no less. I told her, and she stopped mentioning it... for a well. Eventually I just became sort of resigned to it, and foolishly one day I promised her that we could have a threeway with him before he left- still on the condition we had the MFF first. She took it gladly, but she was always trying to get me to just ignore the second part, again because it'd be so hard to get a girl and I \"wasn't the one looking for girls\". Tbh I wasn't really, a threesome sounded kind of sexy but it wasn't something essential to me, I'd never really pushed for it or needed it and honestly I didn't wanna watch the girl I loved getting railed by the guy I knew in second grade.\n\nSince we broke up for the last time she's been with a few new guys, and it crushes me a bit each time but I make sure I never tell her not to do anything (although we've talked long and hard about why it hurts me and how she doesn't mean it to). She's the kind of person to whom sex is purely physical, she can fuck a person and feel no ways about it. I'm not, I've only had sex with two people and I was in love with both of them (vs her 45 by last count), to me sex is something you share with someone you care about; it's also physical and it's about pleasure sure but what would the pleasure mean if you didn't care about the person you're with?\n\nThis mentality is really whats our problem now. She still wants to fuck him, only now it's not in a threesome. She's told me before how she's \"going to fuck him.\", she's promised me that she wouldn't, and then later she's told me how it's not fair for me to ask her not to. See, to me, it seems like I shouldn't have to ask my exgf not to fuck my best friend, for every reason that jumps to most peoples mind when they read that sentence. She doesn't get any of that. She flat out doesn't understand why I'm so opposed to it. She just wants to fuck him before he moves away, and I KNOW that if I were to not say anything that she would. I wish I could say that I could trust Allan not to fuck her (like Connor says \"he knows thats against the bro code\") but I also KNOW that he would. Which I can't quite blame him for, I know she's suuuper hot and I wanted to fuck her too, but he also knows how much this breakup has hurt me. She wants to fuck him and then let him move away and forget about it, but everytime I think about her fucking him I can't help but think that I wouldn't want to be friends with her still if she did, him either.\n\nHer argument: sex doesn't mean anything to her, it's only physical, and he''s moving away so we won't have to deal with it. We're not together any more, I can't control her, she should be allowed to have sex with whoever she wants.\n\nMy argument: I don't want my best friend to fuck the girl I love. I don't want to be the guy who's exgf fucks his friends (AGAIN- this happened last time, which I've explained to her) on top of already being cheated on.\n\nI see her arguments, and I'm not trying to restrict her from things or control her (I've **never** been the controlling type), but honestly it just seems like something I shouldn't have to ask for. I can try and find some kind of place where I can't help but not care that's she with other people; but if I were to try and get to that place where I don't care about the fact that she's now fucking my friend, she'd have to stop being anything to me. Just before we hung up, shortly before posting this, I told her I didn't want this to drive us apart (any more than we already are); she told me I'm the only one making it an issue. And I don't feel like it's an unreasonable issue, but I can't help but wonder... Am I the asshole?",

They were legitimately complimenting each other and showing off what they could do, going all over the place with their voices, fucking up harmonies, and thinking they were killing it.\n\nThey continued doing this with different music theater songs for the rest of the 30-40 minute part of the ride that I was on. I wanted to say something so bad, but a few people were kind of smirking. I would make a \"holy shit this is bad\" look with my face, sort of rolling my eyes, and people noticing it would kind of smile because they knew I was right.\n\nI ended up not telling them to shut up. I know I could have just gone to a different cart, but the train was packed like sardines and the other one looked worse. \n\nAnother issue is, I'm a white guy, and they were both hispanic, and we were heading to a mostly hispanic area, and I didn't want to be that white guy who was a dick to hispanics on a hispanic-dominated train. That might sound racist, but take it for what it is.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I really wanted to say something, I just felt like I'd have been an asshole to say it, even though THEY WERE TOTALLY FUCKING ASSHOLES. They also mentioned a few times that they teacher told them to practice nonstop until the show, but they decided to take it literally at everyone else's expense.\n\nSo, would I have been the asshole to tell them to shut up? I had a strong hunch that if I asked nicely they would have just been rude about it and started singing louder and then I would have just had a fucking brain aneurysm right there on the spot. \n\nAlso, Can we make it okay to ask WIHBTAH? I figured if I didn't start with AITAH it would have been auto spammed.\n\nTL;DR: Teens sung insanely loud and insanely terribly on a 40 minute train ride, and continued to sing as I left. Would I have been the asshole to tell them to shut up, or maybe even to leave and tell them how annoying they sound as I got off at my stop? I mean, they are just kids after all, but like 15-16 year old kids.",

    "selftext": "I'll try to sum this up as shortly as I can, but it's a long story. One of my best friends has had a rough couple of years. He doesn't really deal with emotions well, and has had a couple of deaths in his family, had a girlfriend who he didn't feel treated him right which after the breakup practically drove him to alcoholism, and most notably 1,5 years ago found out his brother (who had 2 kids) had been beaten to the point where he's pretty much dead, and since the people who did it never got caught, and his brother still breathes he hasn't had any closure.\n\nLast summer, he met a bipolar girl, and in a few weeks they got together. She lived in a town about 80 miles from here, and they met during the weekends. After a few months when he lost his job he moved to her.\n\nTo sum up their relationship, he complained that she constantly made things to make him feel bad, and he said she was always bossy and stuff. She later revealed that she only did that to make him feel something, since he was living in a bubble after what happened to his brother, and all of a sudden he started feeling lots of things. Eventually, he started seeing a psychologist which made him feel better, and learn lots of things about himself.\n\nAfter maybe 3 months of living together, she broke up with him because she couldn't stand how negative he was. He turned to alcohol and wanted to kill himself, and she got in touch with him and they worked things out and he started only seeing things positively. No negative things at all in his life, only optimism, and that can be good.\n\nNow to the point. She broke up with him, since apparently they were fighting constantly and she couldn't take it. The following week he was actually writing to me and our buddy about wanting to kill himself, and that he drank every night to be able to sleep. We told him to stop it and move away from her ASAP, since he complained she was doing everything she could to make him feel like crap. He first said she blamed him for making her act like that since *he* was really immature, and we really told him that he should GTFO. He said he wanted to try again, but she said there was no chance they would do that. Important here is that while being sad he was complaining about her always blaming everything on him, and always bossing him around and making him feel worthless.\n\nThe same weekend they both got drunk and ended up in bed, and talked everything out and he understood that despite he really wanted to try again with a relationship it just wouldn't happen. We said that was great and really pushed him to look for an apartment.\n\nA few days later he pretty much wrote *\"Well the pile of shit that is my life won't get smaller. Guess who's pregnant.\"*, and me and my buddy's thought was of course that he didn't really want a kid. We asked him how he felt about it and what they were planning on doing (keeping the kid or not), and he said he didn't know, but it didn't matter since it was her decision. Remember that this is in Sweden where abortion is probably more accepted among the people.\n\nThis is where stuff got bad. We told him that she shouldn't be the one to decide over his life, and if he didn't want to be a dad he shouldn't have to, and if he didn't want the kid the decision would be up to her, and if she wanted to keep the kid all by herself, knowing the dad wouldn't be there, the kid would be her problem. We said this thinking that she was actually considering an abortion, because we felt she was running him over and wanted him to stand up and say it would be stupid to have a kid if that was what he thought. We of course pointed out that they weren't in a good position to get a kid since they broke up and were never going to get together again, and because she wasn't mentally healthy and he had just started to take some babysteps into becoming mentally stable it would be hard, since getting a kid can be a huge pressure and can make people depressed, and she couldn't even handle him for a week acting immature without driving him to the edge of suicide.\n\nA few days later he wrote that he had thought about it and couldn't see a single thing bad about getting a kid. Only positive things. We of course asumed she had decided they were keeping the kid, and he was just trying to make the best of it. We told him to be realistic, and that getting a kid would turn his life upside down and that he shouldn't just do it because this wasn't just a puppy he could give away, or an ugly tattoo he could laser away, but something permanent which could be a financially and mentally monumental challenge. We told him to think seriously about it and encouraged him that if he didn't want the kid, he should tell her that, and we told him to think critically about the whole situation and not just think \"it'll all work out\", since that's his usual mindset which doesn't really always work out.\n\nA few days later, he tells us we have for the final time stepped over the line and that we were horrible people who told him to rule over his girl and that if we really would do something like that to our own girlfriends we deserve to be castrated, and many more things. She wrote directly to me that she wished my mother would abort me. They said we blamed her for everything and thought it was her fault and that he should just leave her to deal with the problem on her own, and they were both furious that we even mentioned an abortion. She was adopted as a kid, and I can see her being upset about that since we'd basically suggest her parents should've aborted her since she apparently was an unwanted child.\n\nHe basically said that if we would ever see his child or him again we'd have to apologize for everything. I said we didn't know she was so against abortions, but he was furious about us even mentioning it and just said all his other friends reacted positively when he said \"I'm going to be a dad\", which in my opinion is a completely different statement for them to react to. My buddy had earlier pretty much told him that if they'd be stupid if they kept the kid, but that was mostly a desperate attempt to get him out of his fantasy-bubble about everything just working itself out, but I can see him being pissed about that.\n\nI wrote endless walls of text breaking down every single word we said and explained how we thought, and I apologized for misunderstanding the situation and drawing the false conclusion that she was considering abortion when she apparently was not, but that their reaction was based on a completely different context than the one we knew about, and that based on the context we knew about we didn't really say anything wrong. We might've used some harsh words and went for some hard \"brotherly love\", but we never meant any harm. He wouldn't buy that, and kept saying that it was all our fault because we drew conclusions, and  that it didn't matter what he had told us earlier since he was sad at that moment, but I maintained that it didn't matter if he was sad because we went by the information we had and tried to support him.\n\nI said I won't apologize if I don't think I've done something wrong, and until he tells me exactly what I've done wrong and I can't explain it with something else than that I was actually wrong, I won't apologize. He wouldn't accept that or even keep talking, but just ended the contact right there. It took more than a week of constant talking before we reached that point, and I was pretty shook up and genuinely angry with his way of dealing with it.\n\nHe later wrote to me in private (we had all conversation in a group chat on Facebook between me, him and our buddy) that he was most sad about losing me as a friend, and that he thought I had gotten less rational and humble than I was earlier. I replied back with a long breakdown of everything that happened, pretty much like I've done here, and he later replied that he didn't really want to do this at all, but just did it because he and the girl had agreed to try to get together again in a few months and since she hated us for what we said he had to get rid of us to get back with her. He said he'd try to work it out with all of us later, but he'd have to get back with her first. \n\nSo, are we the assholes for asuming they were considering an abortion and maybe (probably) being biased to that outcome, or should we have just nodded and agreed to everything he said? Should we have given any advice at all or just played along? \n\nTL;DR: Friend in mentally bad place gets dumped by bipolar girlfriend *twice*, gets her pregnant after other breakup, he says he has nothing to say about keeping the kid or not, we say he should have the right to decide just like she does and that they're in a bad place to get a kid right now, she ends up wanting me dead for suggesting an abortion and he cancels our friendship.",

    "selftext": "I met a girl and we started to get serious fairly quickly.  Early on I told her that if she had been with anyone that was involved in the same sports institution as us.  Which is someone we both know and other mutual friends of ours would know.  That that would be a problem, however I would like to know before hand so that we could either deal with it appropriately or choose to not proceed.  She promised and swore and down that she hadn't.  To the point that on multiple occasions she made me feel like an asshole for ever asking.  Well fast forward three years, and it turns out she has...and with the same someone she said she hadn't.  I told her that she knowingly decieved me and lied and covered it up and that we would no longer be together.  She claims it was a drunken mistake and that she lied because she wanted to be with me and she knew telling me early on.  Would make that impossible.  Since than she has been very loyal.  This lie however is significant and makes me wonder if her excuse about being drunk and it being one time is even true.  As well as calls into question if other things she has said are lies as well.  Am I the asshole for telling her this is irreparable?\n\nEdit 1:  First off thank you for everyone for your replies.  The two sides of the replies is exactly how I have been going back and forth in my head.  Yes she lied yes that dishonest.  She did it to stay with me.  Yet she knew the consequences of lying.  However has been seemingly loyal while together.  It is scary to think what else she has lied about though.\n\nEdit 2:  For those saying it was unfair for me to ask.  Well it is a very tight knit community this place and I knew people would be talking.  I wanted to to know the character of the person I was going to be with.  And if it was a person who was into one night stands or bounced from person to person.  Well than it wasn't for me.  She made it seem like how she was being with me me was special and not common.  So I did not want to be just another guy who just happened to come along.  If she was just going down the list, well than I wasn't something special.  I was just someone who worked out.  \n\nEdit 3:  For those saying at least she came clean when caught.  Well not really it took someone telling me directly to my face for me  to find out.  Which coincidentally is one of the reasons I wanted to know.  If I am defending her honor when people question it by saying oh she has been with some guys and I am saying oh know never she is not like that.  Well I look like a dumb fuck.  So when i did confront she didn't fess up at first.  As always she tried to make me feel bad for listening to others and questioning her.  Something she often did as a means to cover it up.  \n\nEdit 5:  I will tell everyone what bothers me more than the first lie.  It's the way the second and third unfolded.  First she says oh she was out drinking and this guy who we know just called her and asked if she wanted to join him out for drinks.  So she said she went just as friends.  Now from my understanding if a guy you barley know or just met calls you individually to come hang out at a bar to drink with him and his friends.  As a woman you know there is more to it.  So she goes there and gets absolutely plastered.  Guy asks for a ride home she obliges.  He asks her to come in for more drinks and she says she just went to drink and didn't think it was anything more.  Well come on now...a guy of you don't know that well invites you up late at night as a woman you know what that is.  She than says oh we got really drunk I dont know how my clothes ended off and I kinda remember flashes of things.  First she says she doesn't remember sex.  And I tell her as a woman she would know the next day.  She finally admits.  I question if protection was used she says yes ofcourse.  But than if you can't remember how would you know.  So she makes me feel like an  asshole saying she doesn't remember the night and she is ashamed.  Well this deer in headlights things doesn't play well to me.  It seems like she would know why she is going to meet him and why she is going upstairs.  On further pressing she finally admits she remembers being on the bed making out with clothes on,  but once again ofcourse she doesn't remember how sex happened or how clothes got off,  and that she didn't know they would have sex.  I say lying on a a strange mans  bed and gooling around sexually and you don't think that?  Once again oh I can't remember what else happened.  Well eventually she admits she thought the guy was nice and she didn't know anyone down here and just wanted to be wanted.  So alot of the story doesn't add up together to me.  And to seems me that she is using my love for her to play me for a fool.  The whole oh that wasn't my intention and I don't remember what happened...seems very convenient.  She says it was mistake and  once she realized he only wanted sex she stopped,  I wonder what actually happened and if she indeed stopped and if there were others.  When the story peices together she seems different than the girl she presented to me.",

Not to new people, anyway, not unless I have to. \n\nSo this girl at school comes up to me one day while I'm sitting outside of class (I got there early, because of the bus schedule) and sits next to me. I was doing homework, so she popped hers out and did it with me. It meant a lot to me, because no one talks to me, either. And, I'll admit, she's very cute.\n\nSo, months later, she walks by as I'm practicing for an upcoming performance (we're music majors). She sees I'm nervous and gives me a big hug.

    "selftext": "So I was at a party and I got absolutely blind drunk, along with everybody else, it was a fun party. The next morning the girl who hosted starts a Facebook group up titled who stole my champagne. So she writes in the description Hey guys last night was fun but someone stole my bottle of champagne and it was really expensive and I want to know which dickhead it was so they can pay me for being inconsiderate. So I'm like ok I suppose this is reasonable, thinking it was like an \u00a380 (~120USD) bottle or something. So the entire group jumps on the bandwagon - including myself - trying to figure it out, we all looked at pictures of the night and questioned people and stuff. She starts getting really shitty about the whole situation and starts saying really quite nasty things about whoever it was that took the champagne, naturally people are starting to give up and she starts abusing them. So people ask her how much the champagne was and it turned out to be just a \u00a310 bottle from a corner-shop. This girl has a history of being an attention seeker and she's always kind of annoyed me, so yes this was a bit of me getting sick of her, but she really is your stereotypical \u00fcber annoying privileged-private-school-girl. I messaged her saying that the fact that she's started this whole group and lied to people about the price and crucified whoever took the champagne was way out of order and that she should have just let it go. She unsurprisingly says whatever and presumedly said nasty things about me to her friends.\n\nHere comes the plot twist:\n\nIt was me. I was the thief. In my defence I had absolutely no idea it was me. I had zero recollection of the nights events the next morning and nothing had come back to me. There was a single photo of me holding the \u00a310 bottle in question (proof?) and she leapt at the opportunity to blame me. She reopened the group, for the sole purpose of telling the group of people who'd attended that it was me. She posted pictures of the messages I'd sent her about how she'd blown the whole thing out of proportion, and deliberately omitted the messages I'd sent her apologising for what I'd done, and that I genuinely had no idea that I was the culprit. I felt pretty persecuted and got a lot of messages from people telling me I was a dick. I obviously said I would pay for the \u00a310 pound bottle of expensive champagne. I posted on the group explaining myself and she deleted it, and a subsequent screenshot of the post my friend had put up later.\n\nI know that the act of stealing the champagne was wrong, and I'd be happy to just have peace of mind. I understand if I'm the asshole I just want unbiased opinions on the matter.\n\n**EDIT:** I found out I was the culprit at the *very* end of the witch hunt. One of my mates found the picture and posted it half-jokingly, not really expecting anybody to care anymore, seeing as it was \u00a310.\n\n**EDIT 2:** I didn't have the bottle to myself, I was pictured pouring the bottle into like 8 different cups in outstretched hands.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I drank the bottle with anybody who wanted some. I didn't literally steal. I didn't not consume and take it home.\n\n**EDIT 4:** I've paid her back already. Gave her \u00a315 pounds.",

We all have our own reasons; my brother (lead guitar) is pansexual or something (I'm not sure what it is at this point in time) and doesn't appreciate the homophobic jokes our vocalist makes.  He has been asked to stop twice, but rather than apologize, he tries to justify it by saying he learned those jokes from a gay guy and the guy makes those jokes all the time.  Our drummer wants him gone because he just constantly does stuff to piss him off, i.e. moving stuff on the drumset, changing the tone on the set.  He hasn't been asked to stop this but he does understand that drummers hate when people mess with their kit, so it's one of those things that doesn't need to be said, in my opinion.  I want him out because he's dumb.  Plain fucking dumb.  If you asked me to tell you what is going on inside his head when he is spoken to, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0) would be my answer.  Let me count the ways:\n\n* We all don't have a lot of money, just enough for equipment maintenance, gas, and food.  The guitarist, drummer, and I came up with a plan to put together a band fund so that when we need lights, smoke machines, etc. or someone needed to replace a piece of equipment quickly, we don't have to shell out money from our pockets and instead use the money we've saved up.  He refused to throw in, not because it would've put a crimp in his finances, but because he didn't comprehend the point.\n\n* 2 months after bragging about having enough money to replace any piece of equipment we, as a band, owned, he has now had to pick up a 2nd job after falling behind on rent.  In that time, he decided to buy **A GODDAMNED SAILBOAT.**\n\n* One of two vehicle owners in the band, has a truck that could be useful to get to a from peformances, but it needs a windshield replacement, an alignment, new tires, and fluids replaced.  Spends money on a boat and his street bike instead.\n\n* On the day of a performance, he chooses to ride to a town that is an hour away from our rehearsal space an hour before we agreed to meet.  He then gets stuck in traffic, causing him to be 2.5 hours late.  The reason?  He wanted to refill his tank of whippets.\n\nSo tell me...am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of him simply because he's stupid?",

    "selftext": "This happened late last year and it caused a huge rift in my previous high school friend group. I wonder frequently who was in the wrong, and I wanted an outside opinion.\n\nBackstory:\nSenior year of high school, my best friend Oswald's girlfriend Samantha cheated on him. This was a big deal, but it was a bigger deal because that the guy she hooked up with was another member of our friend group, who had been previously super close to Oswald and I, knowing both of us for around eight years. I belong to the camp of once-a-cheater-always-a-cheater, so after that I never trusted her. Oswald stayed with Samantha but the offending guy was, rather unfairly, excommunicated.\n\nNow the event.\nSamantha's closest friend is another guy in the group, Quincy. Quincy and Samantha texted and snapchatted pretty much constantly, but I wasn't close enough to either of them to worry about it or really think about the content. Oswald and I were still close, but I'd also become really close with Quincy's best friend, Dave. One night Dave and I were talking over some video games, and it came up that both of us were suspicious about Quincy and Samantha's friendship. Dave told me that Quincy had confided in him about some things, which to me, if they were true, suggested that there could be something going on. \n\nAccording to Dave, Samantha and Quincy frequently talked about how if Samantha and Oliver should ever break up, they would definitely hook up, and talked often about how attracted they were to each other. Samantha also told Quincy that she would be more than willing to be his New Year's kiss if he didn't have someone. Dave told me that Quincy seemed very evasive about Samantha in conversation, and that he refused to give Dave any sort of details about when they met up or spent time together. I was incensed. \n\nI told Dave that he should tell Oswald immediately, but he told me that he didn't know Oswald well enough, and he said that because he thought it was mainly just flirting that it \"wasn't his place\". I told him I understood, and said I wouldn't act on anything until we knew something for sure. Later that day though, I was seeing Oswald anyway, and I kept thinking in my head that I had to say something. My reasoning being that if I even had a reasonable suspicion, I should say something to him, because it's what I would want him to do if our situations were swapped. As we were parting I told him that I didn't know anything for sure, but that based on a conversation I had had with Dave, he should keep his eyes open about something going on between Samantha and Quincy. I told him not to do anything rash. He asked if I had any evidence and I said no, just a suspicion based on what Dave had told me. \n\nThe next day my phone blows up. Quincy and Samantha are furious with me about how I could accuse them of this. Evidently, Oswald had texted both of them and told them what I said. They both denied it, and were beyond angry with me. This was to be expected, and I still felt satisfied thinking I had done the right thing. Things got worse though, because when Quincy found out what Dave had told me, they had a fight and Dave stopped talking to me. I talked to Oswald and told him that I was sorry for causing this problem. He said it was fine and I made the right decision, but that I was totally wrong and that nothing was going on. He conceded that he handled things to rashly but said it would all be alright. Since then, we have not spoken. I at first assumed Samantha was just keeping him from visiting me, since him and I go to different colleges, but now I've found that he just ignores all of my texts or attempts at contact. \n\nI lost three friends out of this and I feel totally stupid and regretful, but whenever I tell anyone about it they all rally to me and say that I was doing what I thought was best so it's okay.\n\nWhat do you think reddit?\n\nEdit: Changed letters to names.",

    "selftext": "Alright, that title may have been misleading, but you're all only getting my side of the story here so I want to make sure I paint a very clear picture.\n\nFive and 1/2 years ago, I had a baby with a man that I married.  He was 19, I was 21.  He came from a family with very detached parents, I came from a loving, close-knit family.  We were very much the products of our upbringing.  We stayed together until she was ten months old.  During that ten months he was rarely around.  He would stay out until he knew I had her put to bed for the night.  He couldn't stand the sound of her crying, he would never allow himself to be left alone with her.  Looking back as an adult, it is very clear he was young, inexperienced and terrified.  At the time, I was also young and inexperienced, and didn't understand why he couldn't just love and spend time with our daughter.\n\nHe left when she was ten months old, letting me know that I could contact him for child support but he wasn't interested in raising this child.  Once he moved out, I didn't let him move back in, but when he came around feeling sorry for his actions, I wanted him to see our daughter so I allowed visits.\n\nAfter the first couple of visits, he started coming later and later and eventually began showing up after she was in bed.  When I realized he was visiting ME instead of HER, I put a stop to it.  He became angry and again told me that he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.\n\nThis time, I decided there were no take-backs.  From my point of view, I didn't want my daughter to deal with a father that was in-and-out of her life. By this time, she was only a year old, but eventually she would grow up and I never wanted her to hear her own father say outloud that he wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nWe went through the court for our divorce that year.  Having never actually been left alone with our daughter, he was given supervised visitation once/week through a facility in our county.  He attended the first few times and then just stopped showing up.  He didn't even show up to the last two divorce/custody hearings and they ended up finalizing it without him present.  \n\nNow my daughter is 5 and 1/2.  I've always been honest with her about the situation to an age-appropriate level.  (You used to have another daddy, but he knew he wasn't very good at being a daddy so he went away so that your life could be filled with love and joy.  Then it was just you and me for a while until we met _[my husband]__ and now he takes good care of you.)  She loves her step-dad, knows he isn't her biological father but she wants to call him Dad anyway.  She is happy and healthy and thriving.\n\nMy ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her.  I didn't even text him back.  As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don't want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her.  My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I'll let HER choose when they meet up.  I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is  mature enough.  \n\nWe come from a small town, he still talks to friends of friends of friends of mine.  Word has come back to me that people now thing I am this horrible bitch, witholding this poor man from seeing his daughter even when he is repenting for his actions.  \n\nI honestly don't even see him as \"the asshole\" except for the spreading of his pity party.  I see him as a troubled teen who got scared and couldn't handle the task of raising a child.  Up until now, I had actually been thankful to him that he made the choice to leave instead of making her early years harder.  \n\nSorry for the long post, but I feel it was all relevant to understand both sides.

Okay, in high school. dated a guy for OVER A YEAR. which is pretty damn long for high school. I have trouble making friends and had trouble keeping relationships so obviously he meant a lot to me. the world. Near the end of my relationship, he reconnected with this girl. I guess they were super close in elementary school and were at the very least acquaintances in middle school. It made me somewhat uncomfortable and I expressed it, but got reassured every time. I knew the girl, I liked her and I figured might as well get to know her better. I REALLY liked her and I thought we were friends, we would walk together after class, went to each others parties, etc. ALL WITHOUT MY BF AT THE TIME. I technically was friends with her for several months before they reconnected. and not being able to make friends- she meant a lot. especially as a female. I don't get along with girls, mainly guys. that's why I hardly intervened with them hanging out, I'd be a hypocrite. When I realized how often they were hanging out, (EVERY DAY AFTER WE HAD FINISHED) I asked what the difference was between us. \"Well I love you both. but I love her like a sister.\" Which shut me up. well we broke up and the same day, she told him that she liked him. Seems pretty fucked up, right? They start dating, this entire time she avoids the topic of him in every conversation like the fucking plague. I had to bring it up and even then she was shy about it. I still somewhat talk to my ex and I vented to him and he said that she was probably overcome with guilt. My thing was - A friend hesitates to do it, not hesitate to tell you. he expressed to her I was upset and all she really told me over and over was \"I'm not a people person\" and \"Could you please not be mad\" so no, I just told her no. flat out. she's super passive and really fake in my eyes. I brought this up to a mutual friend of mine and my ex's and he was like \"Well she's liked him since middle school\" and completely dismissed it and kept talking. is it really not that big a deal since they've known each other longer? Am I crazy? This all happened a while ago. we broke up 4 months ago and they've been dating for 3 I think... also fucked up, no? We had a good, healthy relationship up until the last week. but please be honest. I still get really passionate about this, but I'm over him. none of it is \"you dated my ex, you bitch\" its more like, \"I thought we were friends and you totally betrayed me\" Haven't talked through any of it (she's passive and fake..) I just told her I don't really want to be her friend anymore and ignored it. which was really hard, like I cried over losing that potential of a friend. but the whole thing is still messed up to me. I've grown to accept it but I really wanted to know so that I don't look like a total bitch. \nThanks. anything appreciated.\n",

After about 2 weeks of this, I just straight asked her what we were, to which she replied \"nothing\". I said that I didn't understand - why would she refuse going out if she admitted to liking me? She responded that she has anxiety &amp; depression and doesn't think she can. I have had depression, so I was determined to help her out of it.

It's to the point where in the entirety of 2014, I was alone in the apartment for 45 minutes total.\n\nI don't like being bothered when I'm cooking - I just want to keep my head down and get on with it, and because of this I rarely use the kitchen.  Someone always comes out and wants to talk to me, or use the stove at the same time, and I don't like being distracted.  Because I get annoyed, I try to remove myself from this situation as much as possible.\n\nToday I wanted to sneak in some raviolis for dinner.  They were fresh from a market that makes them on site.  Because they were never frozen, total cook time once the water is boiling is around five minutes.  These are the kind of stealth meals I try to make.  \n\nThe girlfriend (who is also a rent paying tenant in this apartment - four people in a five bedroom, in a tight rental market, in a decent location) had asked me to bring these raviolis home and make them because she had come from the dentist and wanted to eat something soft for dinner.\n\nI get home, and the roommate had every surface area in the kitchen covered in food prep work.  Cutting boards, vegetables, packaging, measuring cups, pots and pans, etc.  He had all four stove burners going.\n\nKeep in mind, he is home all day.  He has hours and hours of alone time every single day of the week.  \n\nNormally when this happens - and it happens a lot - I'll just get delivery even if I was planning on cooking that night.  Often, even if I had just come from the grocery store with dinner.  But the girlfriend had her heart set on these raviolis.  So I basically told her \"I can't deal with being down here, I will literally go anywhere with you right now, I will bring home food from a restaurant down the street, I will pay for delivery, I will go to the grocery store and get you whatever you want, there's just no room for me to make these raviolis for you.\"  But she insisted on making them herself, so I removed myself from the situation.  I guess she got him to give up one of the burners and had to dance around him while she heated them up and and then used the same pot for the sauce I had also brought home.\n\nThe thing is, I said all this *right in front of him*.  He can surely tell that I get annoyed at him for doing stuff like this, but I've never \"had a conversation\" with him about it because who am I to tell him when he can or can't use a common area?  I don't feel like I have the right to do that.  Even if I requested it, I don't think he'd care.  I've asked once or twice to use a common room to watch a football game and he sat in the same room the whole time watching a movie on his laptop, no headphones.  He's not a bad guy, it's just that unless it's someone's closed bedroom, he just doesn't give a fuck about boundaries and I've given up.\n\nI don't think my outburst phased him too much - it's two hours later and he's still cooking.  \n\nBut I do feel bad for my passive aggressive behavior.  I am ashamed, but things were at their \"boiling point.\"  Was I being the asshole?",

    "selftext": "Here's the backstory:\n\nFor about 6 months I've liked this girl who I have known for about 6 years. She and I would either text or snap each other daily for the last 6 months. A lot of the conversation was flirty, so I decided to make a move finally about two or three weeks ago.\n\nI texted her and asked if she wanted to go out the next day. She said that she wasn't sure if she could, but would let me know. 6:30pm rolls around the next day, and I haven't heard from her. I texted her asking if she still wanted to go out that night. She said that she was tired after being on her feet and being involved in activity (dancing) all day.\n\nNo big deal, right? I asked if she wanted to go out next weekend, she said maybe. Fine, not the result I had hoped for, but let's just move on from it. I called my friends up to express my anger about the situation, and how I felt that upset that it seemed as though she wasn't going to let me know that she didn't want to go out that night.\n\nHere is where the drama begins. 2 hours later she posts an story on Snapchat that said she was on her way to a town nearby where we live. She was going there to go drinking like she frequently does. I was kind of pissed that she blew me off and gave me a lie in order to go drinking. \n\nI sub \"respond\" by putting up a Snap story with my friends with a caption that said \"Plan B.\" My friend also tweeted \"left my man hanging today, smh\" and I retweeted it. \n\nShe shares a class with my friends and the next day told them that she thought it was immature that I put up that snap and retweeted my friend's tweet. She hasn't told me this and doesn't know that I know that she is pissed at me. I have been to 3 parties since then and she won't reply to my snaps and wouldn't speak more than four words or so at the parties to me. I would text her and try to diffuse the situation, but I don't think that I'm in the wrong.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "I made a throwaway for this because enough people I know on reddit could identify me because of this story. This is sort of long compared to other posts, but I do believe that a lot of background information is necessary for proper judgement. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible, but I apologize in advance.\n\n**~~A Little~~ Background on Me, The Autistic schoolmate, and my school:**  \nI'm jewish. Not particularly religious, but I don't take antisemitism very kindly. Normally I can brush certain things off, as long as they're very clearly in fun, even when they're not so friendly I can laugh it off myself. Physically I'm big enough to come off as intimidating, I'm built very heavily from weightlifting but I'm also very lean. A bear-jew, if you will.\n\nAs for the person that I beat up, this is what I know about him: He surely has some experience with being bullied. He doesn't come off as normal in appearance or behavior and he clearly has a disorder on the Autism Spectrum. Physically he's long and skinny, with almost albino white skin and very bright blond hair, and a scruffy blond neckbeard. Disregarding all of that, this kid is absolutely brilliant when it comes to Math and Science. For the rest of the post, let's call him Mike.\n\nMy particular highschool is a small, publicly funded so not private, \"specialized\" school for people with interest in STEM fields. 150 kids at most and every single one of them is a huge nerd, including me. Among other things my school comes off as a safe-haven for kids who have had experience as a victim of bullying, and as a matter of fact my \"fight\" with Mike was the first physical \"fight\" at the school in at least 4 years.\n\n\n**Prelude to Story for extra background:**  \nThe fight happened when we were both Juniors, so we had known each other for the better half of 3 years. He's said things that have gotten on everybody's nerves, many of these things were along the lines of bragging about his intelligence. Nobody would say he came off as nice, and everybody after so long had come to the conclusion that he had some severe mental disorder. \n\nHe tended to say things to specifically get on people's nerves, as well. Not just once, he would repeat them very often.\n\nThe past few years, between high school and the internet, have included the most antisemitism that I've ever been exposed to. It might be a new trend and it might just be growing up to realize it was there all along, whatever. I became the target of jew-jokes, and for quite a while I handled it very well. When Mike hopped on board with the trend (or whatever) he didn't quite seem to get the patterns in what actually made jew-jokes funny. He would mostly go into the holocaust, and say jokes about Jew's being gassed and burned, while the norm seemed to mostly be about Jews being greedy, of course with the occasional Holocaust reference which was deemed funny for its shock value.\n\n**Now for what I may be an asshole for:**  \n*I'll refer to myself as Moishe when needed*  \nOne day, a Wednesday, I was going off task while in a group project with him and another student who-- this doesn't actually matter too much-- was half-black. Mike wasn't too happy about this but I continued to goof off. \n\nHe finally said the words \"Moishe, you're justifying the holocaust.\"\n\nAs open to interpretation as this might seem, it was in fact quite clear what he was saying, as it had been said to me before with clearer context: I, by being a jew who was annoying him, was justifying the genocide of the people I represent. Despite what you might think, this is not what I got mad and beat him up for. I did get mad, but was thinking about a big standardized test that was the next day, which I didn't want to miss by being suspended or expelled.\n\nThe next day, after the test was over I was talking to a friend about why I was mad at Mike at that particular moment in time, and I talked about what he said to piss me off. He jokingly suggested kicking his ass, which got me thinking about what I could possibly get away with. \n\nThe next day, Friday I had the same class as on Wednesday, and was continuing to work (maybe not so hard) on the group project with him. I was still very mad about what Mike said, so I decided to recreate the circumstances. I started to goof off and antagonize him to an extent, just to get him annoyed enough to say the same thing again. The goal being *this* time I could actually physically retaliate without worrying about getting suspended before a big test. I wasn't just going to beat him up without him saying anything right then and there, I had to have enough witnesses knowing what I was beating him up for. Once I got him to say the same exact words, I started to yell at him and call him a Nazi.\n\nAdjacent to the half-black person he says the words \"At least I'm not a nigger\"\n\nI continued to yell at him more and more, this time with the full support of our half-black friend (he wasn't participating in the yelling, but it was clear he was on \"my side\")\n\nWith the attention of a solid third of the class, he says again \"Moishe, stop justifying the holocaust.\"\n\nAnd then I beat him up.\n\nI got the entire school cheering for me beating up the kid that nobody liked because he was Autistic, for saying something that I wasn't even that mad about, mostly just mad that he thought he could get away with saying it. Am I the asshole?\n\n**EDIT:** I just want to add that we both actually walked away fine, me with a bloody lip from when he threw something at me. The worst thing I did in the long run was probably the psychological impact he received by someone basically attacking him for something he said. \n\nI think it's settled that I'm the asshole, but (and sorry if saying this makes me more of an asshole) I can't say I'd handle it differently if it happened again. It's worth being an asshole if I can get someone, regardless of their mental health, to be afraid of publicly saying things that support the holocaust. \n\n**EDIT #2:**\n\n**Breakdown of the physicality, which originally I thought not to be important:**  \nMe beating him up went a little like this. I started yelling things at him and letting real rage actually get out of me. I stood up, and grabbed his chair to try to get him to face me and look me in the eye (it actually took a long time to decide whether I would go through with getting physical) but things escalated quicker than anticipated because right then and there is what actually started the fight: When I grabbed his chair, I pulled too hard and he fell right out of it, onto the floor. He took this as the \"first swing\" and quickly stood up, and in a somewhat mechanical fashion, he threw his open binder at my head, and the open rings scratched me and drew blood from my forehead and my top lip. The class (100% were watching at this point) considered this the \"first swing.\" I grabbed his shoulders and swung him around to start hitting him, but he ducked fairly quickly and all of my punches actually skimmed his back, IIRC. A girl was screaming \"stop fighting\" just like in that one Key &amp; Peele bit, and I sort of didn't know what to do at that point to I stepped away.\n\n**What happened after the situation:**  \nAs I mentioned before, I got the whole school cheering for me and assuring me that they took my side. I went to the Vice Principle's office and he went to the head-counselor-guy's office and talked about what happened to our respective recipient. Side-note: Some of you said I should have talked to a special-ed guy about Mike's behavior, but somehow the special-ed guy didn't actually get involved at all. Both Mike and I independently agreed to having a meeting with each other, supervised by the head-counselor-guy and the Vice Principle. This is the meeting where it became quite clear to me that he knew exactly what he was saying and that he intended for it to be hurtful, not a joke. After he admitted that, he became a broken record of \"it's both of our faults, but we should forget it and move on.\"\n\nThat's it, I suppose. Everything else I could really contribute has either already been said or is personal info that I'd rather avoid. Keep on judgin', /r/AmItheAsshole!",

    "selftext": "My mom had to go to the hospital and I went with her. She was supposed to make dinner for the family and unfortunately due to how long we were there it looked like it was not going to happen. I knew my father had a long day at work so I decided to order out for the night since I couldn't be there to cook myself.\n\nI called the house and every time I called, I was told by my father that he and my brother can wait till we get home to make the order. I texted my brother my credit card information after the first call so he can order while I'm not there. It was getting extremely late and I called one more time to have them make the order because after a certain time the place stops delivering. My father got pissed at me because I kept calling and trying to make sure dinner was taken care of and he told me to mind my business and stop calling and stop being annoying. This in turn upset me so I told my brother to forget about ordering and delete all my CC info that I gave him. I told him specifically not to use my card and **do not** buy anything.\n\nAround 10pm we are finally finished with the hospital, and my mom calls the house to check up on my father and brother. I overhear her say that food was ordered. I quickly check my bank account and I find out my money was used and it was *a lot.* To say I wasn't angry was a understatement. I was **livid.** I quickly explain to my mom why I was so angry and hurt because I was first yelled at for trying to make sure the family was fed and then my brother went behind my back and used my money after I told him not to.\n\nWhen we got home I couldn't even look at my father and brother. I went to the bathroom, took a deep breath and told myself to just suck it up and just eat my food. I sit down and the first words out of my father's mouth are \"Why is her face all twisted?\" My mom says ask me instead of her. I tell my dad I'm fine, and my mom starts explaining why I'm upset. My dad casually brushes off what she says by saying, \"Oh, well she should of just called if she didn't want us to order, and if she wanted a particular item off the menu she should of called\" I calmly put down my fork and say, \"Excuse me, I called MULTIPLE times to tell you to order not too late and you yelled at me and tole me to stop calling. Beside I told (and I pointed to my brother) him to tell you I'm not ordering anymore because of your attitude.\" That of course he didn't want to hear and proceeded to yell saying how he never yelled, and my mom cut in saying she heard him yelling at me in the hospital when I was on the phone. I told my father I did not appreciate the way he spoke me and I also mentioned that he continues to not respect anything I say. \n\nHe blew up telling me to shut the F up and I can because I'm the father, to which I screamed at him that that's not the way you speak to your daughter and it was just a constant back and forth with him getting in my face and telling me to shut up and eat my food. He then told me if I don't like it I can GTFO the house and I quote, \"IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GET A REAL JOB AND GTFO OF MY HOUSE! YOU WANT RESPECT GET OUT. I'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT AND I'M DONE\" He kept trying to get in my face to hit me but my brother was keeping him down and he finally went upstairs.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was trying to order out for the family because both my mom and I couldn't be there. After being told to stop calling, I tell my brother to not use my money. I find out my money was used and I get yelled out for speaking my mind and defending myself.",

She wasn't thrilled honestly, but got into it as the night went on. \n\n\nIn the last hour of prom, she told me she was gonna go talk to her friends \"for a few minutes.\" I said \"ok\" and thought nothing of it. I didn't see her for the rest of the night until the very end when we were all going home or to our after prom plans. She also refused to do the couple's dance with me. \n\n\nSo I was sitting in the lobby waiting for my ride when she came over to me. She didn't seem to think anything was wrong with what she did, but I was livid. I'm telling you right now, I was so mad I could barely speak to her. I didn't explain why at the time. She then went to the bathroom for a bit, but when she did, I just left and didn't say goodbye. Solely because I was feeling so hurt and I just needed to go. \n\n\nWe didn't talk for a day. Then I texted her saying I was sorry for leaving without saying goodbye. She asked why I did that and I explained I was hurt and mad at her. She gave a halfhearted (in my opinion) apology and that was it. After that, we haven't talked much. And she mostly ignored me at our graduation.

He wasnt expecting them to come home today, the day we planned on hanging out, so I suggested he just comes over instead.\n\nThis is not a problem at all for either of us, we're literally a block apart. We both dont mind walking at all, so that wasnt the problem. The problem apparently is he wants to have sex when really all I wanted to do today was hang out, play xbox, cuddle a bit, and other innocent stuff. He says that if I just wait until Thursday for them to leave (they take the dogs with them) then it'll be fine and we'll have the \"best of both\". I don't see it that way, since I want the WHOLE day to be innocent. Its not very comfortable for me to screw around then chat with his brothers or stepmom. I said \"I don't see why both days can't happen\" and that really pissed him off. He said I'm being ridiculous and when I said its not fair to me, he mocked me saying \"Oh my god its not fair\". This really hurts because we did plan on hanging out today but now all it seems like is he just wants to screw around.\n\nAm i being too irrational or clingy over this? Should I be glad we're going to hang out even if its not the day i planned?",

We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him.

This is made particularly \nworse because this person keeps claiming that \"they know what they need to know\". You obviously don't if you're asking me to do shit I was able to do at 6 years old....especially when you don't even make an effort to learn. \n\nAnyway, this family member asked me if I could help them with some issue they were having with their computer. So I went to help them, and when I got there, they wanted help *sending an attachment on an email*. Emphasis mine, as I was so frustrated at their stupidity, I really wanted to cry. \n\n  Anyway, we logged into the email account, pulled up the 'new message' screen and filled in the body of the email. Then I started on sorting out the attachment. \n\nIt quickly became apparent to me that I was going to have problems. This family member didn't have a clue about using the 'browse' function of a computer, and the most basic terms like 'file' and 'format' were like I was speaking Russian. I could feel myself getting so pissed off with this person I wanted to scream, and it must have been showing. I tried my absolute hardest to give an ELI5 (or more like an ELI2) sort of level explanation, but even then it wasn't the easiest. \n\n **Situation 2** \n\n This happened a few hours after the first. I'd gone to make a piece of toast of all things, and I set the dial on the side to 3. I set it away in the toaster and went off to do something else. When I came back to it, the toaster was giving off smoke and the toast was charcoal. I realised the dial had been moved asked this family member if they knew anything about it and they said they'd adjusted the dial. I lost my temper and went on a rant about how I would expect if something was a certain way when I left it, it'd be that way when I came back, and I still can't work out the logic of someone changing it. \n\nSo, who's the asshole?

I didn't want my dog to catch them, because flea tablets are extremely expensive.\n\nAfter a week of staying with me, she still hadn't done that. She kept saying \"I'm too busy with work; I'll do it tomorrow.\" But when I started seeing fleas jumping around my home, I decided to take matters into my own hands. \n\nSo while she was at work, I bathed her dog, cut its fur pretty short, combed the fleas out (there were hundreds), and then gave him a flea tablet recommended by my vet, purchased with my own money.

She said I had no right to touch her dog's fur without her consent. I told her she can either be grateful that I groomed her neglected dog, or she can find a new place to stay. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: Many here are asking why I had to cut the dog's fur. Here's my answer from the comments:\n\nMy second condition was that she get rid of the dog's fleas. I'm not sure if you've seen how long a shih-tzu's hair can grow, but it's nearly impossible to comb fleas out at full-length. \n\nCheck out dog rescue videos where people take dogs off the streets and nurse them to health. Long-haired dogs are almost always shaved in order to care for their skin and rid the fleas more easily.\n\nSo, tl;dr, I cut the puppy's hair so that I could care for his skin and comb the remaining fleas out.",

He said something about it not having to do with that specifically but 'the way he gets treated'. He was mad, like real mad, and kept shouting shit. I should note at this point my dad has been under a lot of stress with his business failing, and usually he is extremely well mannered and helps out a lot in the house, this case is the only time in my life I've seen him this crazy, and I attribute it to the stress.\n\n\n\nAnyway I call him out on this and tell him to \"shut the fuck\" up and to sit down and eat his meal. He quips back that I should \"mind my own fucking business\". I stand up for myself and my mum and sister who are being shouted at, then he walks over to me like he wants to start a fight. Again I stand up for myself, and when he gets too close to me I shove him back. He's not a threat to me, he's like 5'7\" and I'm 6'2\", but at this point my mum seperates us and tells us to stop. We continually exchange pleasantries and I call him out about what a dick he's being, using colourful language. Well since then he didn't say a word to me or my sister for 3 weeks, no eye contact, not one word. It doesn't phase me, I like to be left alone at home anyhow and I work/study quite a bit.\n\n\n\nLast night he finally broke his silence and asked me if we were going to 'resolve our differences'. I said sure. He quickly mumbled his apology and I said \"I accept your apology, I'm ready to move on from it\". This is the part where I could have apologised, but the thing is, I'm not sorry, not one bit. I said to him, \"if you acted like that again I would have had the exact same reaction and I don't make any apologies for how I reacted to your behaviour\". He looked at me, puffed his breath and returned his gaze to the TV. He hasn't spoken to me since.\n\n\n\nSorry for the long post. Should I apologise even though I don't mean it or am I being an asshole? I should reiterate, my dad's a good hardworking guy, and this whole thing is a result of the stress he's under from his business, but he's lost a lot of my respect the last 3 weeks. I'm willing to move on from this but I don't want to apologise, because I wouldn't mean it.",

    "selftext": "So, I know that girl barely but for a long time. We hadn't any interaction in the last couple of years however, 2 weekends ago, we met again at a big party. She was very flirty, saying how good looking I am, how horny I make her. She is really good looking and I'm not often the target of such flirty behaviour.\nAs the night went along, we fooled around, than she said she has a boyfriend. I wasn't sure what to do, but I was horny, she was horny, we both were tipsy. So we had fun that night.\n\nFast forward to today, we were messaging each other a bit and she still thinks that I'm bloody handsome. I'm a bit unsure what to do. As I said, I'm not often target of so much affection but to be completely honest, I think this whole thing is kinda exciting. \n\nAt the end of next week, her boyfriend is away for a couple of weeks and she wants to meet. The question I have now, am I the asshole if I agree?\n\nedit: I don't know her boyfriend and I have no clue how their relationship is going. I only know she hadn't had sex in a long while.\n\nedit2: Thanks everyone for actually having a decent conversation. I made up my mind, I'll meet her but I will talk to her about her boyfriend. I want to know at least half of the story and regardless of what she is telling me, I want her to end the relationship. Either that or I'm leaving. Easy as that. \n\nFor anyone wondering what led me to that decision: \n\nHe could be too much of a nice guy. I still don't care about the status of their relationship or their relationship in general. I don't think I'm the one ruining it, it's already ruined. All the comments about how a relationship needs to be taken care of and somehow I'm also obligated to do that are nonsense. Specially this kind of relationship. I don't think my action forms me to an asshole or that I'm somehow unable to love anyone anymore. The only thing that got me thinking is, if this guy is just a nice guy, I would be sorry for him. Sorry for him to be in this situation with a girlfriend who doesn't love him as much as he does. \n\nAs it stands, I'm the asshole, probably a sexless asshole. Thanks for that guys...\n\nlast late edit: Just in case someone is stumbling over this thread the conclusion is: they broke up. He was kinda nice, but they had huge problems from the beginning. She just wasn't able to take it anymore, no physical harm, just never a secure or happy relationship. She is full of regret, more so than I am I have to admit. If she had the chance to revert her actions, she would have ended it far earlier. I still meet her, quite often actually and it's possible that this will lead to somewhere. If you read my comments down there, you may have a bad picture of me, rightfully so. I'm a bonehead who defeats his point even after proven wrong and it reads as I have no empathy what so ever. I even wrote I don't want to be a relationship with her... Looking back, I should have done things differently, but I can't change the past, so I'm living with my decisions and with the words I've written. I won't delete anything, although I hope she never finds this thread. Why I'm writing this here? I have no idea, I just felt like to end the story.",

I need some strangers to tell it like it is.  \n  \nI'm a taxi driver. A middle aged man approached my window and asked if I could take his three companions to a local hotel. They were younger than him and from the way they were talking sounded like they may have been his employees.  When I agreed he asked the price, \u00a33.50 (very short journey). He handed me a \u00a320 note, asked me to take care of them and walked away without another word. I drove them to the hotel, full of glee at my 600% tip.  \n  \nYou may now see where this is going. I pulled up at the hotel, said my goodbyes and waited for the three to climb out. After a short pause one of the three asked for the change.  Now, I'm quite an agreeable fellow, I'm very polite and do my job well. I would rather be slightly out of pocket to help keep the peace in any other situation, but in my opinion this was my money, given to me with no further instructions to pass it on to anyone else. If the paying gentlemen wanted me to give the change to his companions he should have made it clear, when someone gives a person in the service industry a note and then walks away, that's language for 'this is your tip'.  \n  \nAnyway, I told the young man that there was no change, there were no instructions to give the change to him. A ten minute stand off ensued, during which they tried to phone the paying guy. I told them that if he said to give them the change I gladly would, but in the end they couldn't reach him. All three of them were visibly aghast at the stance I was taking, it culminated with them all at my window, the girl in the group screaming at me to give them the money. No, it was my money, not theirs. They asked for a receipt which I gave them, writing '\u00a320 received, with thanks' (ok, I'm definitely an asshole for that, but I was really wound up by this point). They left, very angry.

It was very stimulating conversation in the beginning but very quickly devolved into massive ideological and political arguments daily.\n\nWe talked about commitment and decided no. She very quickly proposed an open relationship which I said no but it didn't matter because it was \"her body\" and she could do whatever she wanted. Which while I don't totally disagree I think it's a horribly shitty attitude especially if you're considering taking someone seriously ever.\n\nSo this opens up a whole new can of worms and we are arguing every day about her right to have sex with other men and not tell me about it. So I finally concede and say doesn't matter but if she gets involved with someone else she needs to tell me so I can leave because Im not interested in having that in my relationship. She agrees.\n\nAnother important note about this is that I could never really tell if she had any serious interest in me because she hated romance and gestures. We got in an argument because I got her flowers once.\n\nSome time goes by and a girl I used to know starts talking to me. I figure things aren't really going smooth with girl 1 so I'll tell her and maybe end it. As soon as there is any hint of this becoming romantic I go to tell the girl Im dating. She is crushed. She won't talk to me. She calls me a hypocrite. She's crying, a couple days later we break up and it seems fine and I date girl number 2.\n\nOriginally I thought we broke up because of all the arguments I never made the connection. But I come to find out that we broke up because she was upset that I held her to the standard that I didn't comply to. \n\nBut I tell her that argument is bull because as soon as the other girl came around I told her just like I expected her to tell me and she fought me tooth and nail about how I \"threatened to leave if she did\".  I just don't think that's fair. She had the right to leave too. And she did.\n\nSo I like to think she's mad because I got a new girl before she could get a new guy.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

However, I have [Schizotypal Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder), which (among other things) makes me read way too far into meaningless events and actions. I've been extremely careful to reign in my thought processes and try to deal with my anxiety in a proper and healthy way, but I often don't know if I'm doing it properly.\n\nA few months after graduation, I start catching her in small lies to avoid me. Things like \"I'm too busy to go shopping or hang out,\" then I see her where I asked her to go while she was supposed to be busy. She always had an excuse, but \"I'm going to lie and say I'm busy so I can do what you want to do with a different group of people and not invite you\" never sat well with me.\n\nThe final straw was her birthday. For my birthday, a bunch of friends and I went out to dinner and she covered my part of the bill. It was a fun night for all. A few months later, after the whole lying paragraph above was in full swing, her birthday was coming up. I told her I wanted to return the favor and treat her to her favorite restaurant on her birthday along with some friends. She said she couldn't do it because she had to work. \"Oh, it must suck to work on your birthday,\" I thought, so I bought her a gift card to where we were going to go that night, put it in a birthday card, and went to where she worked (she was a cashier, so it would be easy to see her while she was working). I figured a small gift and a friendly face would make working on your birthday a little less shitty. But when I get there, she's not there. She was never scheduled to work that day. I see on Facebook the next day that she had, in fact, gone out to dinner. I was, predictably, not invited. \n\nShe knew I was upset, because she attempted to apologize, but I refused to listen. It's been about two years now and I've refused to talk to her. She calls or texts me every once in a while, wishes me happy birthday on Facebook and the like, but I've completely removed her from my life.

The theater was a shitshow in the sense that two teenage girls behind us would not shut the fuck up throughout the entire movie and the guy next to me would not shut the fuck up either. It was like they were in their own livingrooms, talking loudly about every little detail. It was the second worst movie going experience I've ever had. \n\nAnyways, up front someone brought a person with a severe mental handicap. I don't know a lot about these things, but wheelchair bound and physical deformities. \n\nAnyways, the poor guy keeps screaming all throughout the entire movie. It's like the sound that many of the dinosaurs make when they yell. In fact, it was sometimes hard to distinguish between the sounds from the movie and the sounds coming from the front of the audience. \n\nAs we left the theater, we all started talking about what parts of the movie we liked and didn't and stuff like that. My friend began to bitch about the teenage girls behind us. My ten year old son chimed in that the guy in the wheelchair was really annoying. My friend started to correct my son, saying it's not the guy's fault. \n\n\"This is true,\" I interrupted, but then I went on to explain that it's the fault of the person who took the guy to the movie. \n\n\"Would you take an infant to this movie?\" I asked. He responded that he wouldn't. I asked why, and he said because the baby would cry and interrupt the film for everyone. I said this isn't any different. \n\nMy friend countered saying that the disabled fellow has the right to see a movie. I countered that I am fair certain that he has no more rights than our children because he has a legal guardian who cares for him. \n\nI argued  that the legal guardian should know as well as we did when our kids were babies to not bring that guy to the theater. Perhaps he enjoys films, but can do so at home. Perhaps the guardian enjoys going to the movies, but can do so when a sitter is available just as we did when our kids were little and we wanted to go see a movie, and as we still do for many other kinds of outings. Bringing this person to an auditorium of 500 people trying to watch a movie that we all paid good money was poor judgement, IMO. \n\nMy friend said I am an asshole. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n",

A door was completely smashed in, like kicked open. I asked what happened and was told that a guy and his SO were having an argument and the SO locked herself in the bathroom to get away from him. He broke down the door and dragged her out of the bathroom and into his car and drove away. None of the people remaining seemed to care because they were drunk and high on both weed and acid. At this point, I couldn't handle it anymore; I had a stressful week of class and I had a long day ahead of me with only 2 hours of sleep. I called cops to try and get control of the situation and hopefully help that girl out who was basically  kidnapped. I told the people who were there that the cops were coming, and they pretty much bolted. They eventually came back and were confronted by the cops, but no one was arrested.

I have tried to bring it up a few times but each time she says no or acts like it is some sort of interrogation. I understand why she is worried about her dad but its been 3.5 years, he knows I exist, moving in makes financial sense but i'm not set in stone on that, and she wont even talk to me about school just gives me run about answers.  \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to sit down and start making long term plans/goals. I'm 24 and am in the starting process of really looking at the long term of my life. I want to either move forward in this relationship or start to loosen it up so I can enjoy my last year as a college kid. I do love her but I can't put time into something that isn't going anywhere anymore. \n\nThe catch is this weekend I am going to town to celebrate her birthday that was last week. Is it to assholeish to talk to her this weekend about it? To be clear I do want to be with her and she is one of the few people I could see a future with...but I can't be with her if she wont communicate or doesn't have the same long term goals as me. \n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for wanting to talk to my girlfriend about plans for the future on her birthday weekend even though she refuses to talk about it? \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I have decided to lay off meeting the parents as that may be a cultural thing that I just don't grasp. I'm going to work on communication and if she truly doesn't want to talk then I will have to start thinking that this relationship isn't going anywhere.  Thanks so much for the responses I think I found one of my new favorite subreddits! ",

We go to the outdoor patio of a coffee place and he shows me the gift: a pipe, some tobacco and matches. \n\nWhile he's showing me to smoke the pipe, his girlfriend mentions that she occasionally smokes cigarettes, and he's bewildered because she'd told him she didn't like smoking. She says that she doesn't, but she's mainly a social smoker. He gets mad that she lied to him, and they leave a few minutes later. I stay for a bit, finish the tobacco that's in the pipe, and leave.\n\nGetting into my car, I get a call from him. He'd said that they might come back later, so this isn't *too* unexpected. I answer, and he asks me where I am in a panicked voice. He sounds like he's freaking out, and I'm thinking that they've broken up or something. I tell him to calm down and tell me what's up, he screams into the phone, breathes a bit, and then says that he's got a dead body in the car. That they started arguing and he stabbed her.\n\nAt this point, I start panicking. Telling him that he fucked up, that I don't know what the fuck to do, this whole time I'm asking him if he's fucking with he or not, he insists that he's serious. After a good five minutes, he starts laughing. It was a joke, she's there with him, the patched things up.\n\nI call him a dick, laugh a bit, and tell him that I was literally a couple seconds from hanging up and calling the cops. At this point he gets mad that I wasn't gonna help him get rid of the body, says that he would have helped me, etc. Even *she* takes his side, insisting that she \"wouldn't want revenge if he did kill her\" and that calling the police would make me \"a dick and a pussy at the same time.\" He sounds like he's honestly hurt and betrayed.\n\nI'm bewildered right now. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they were pulling another one. But just in case; am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit...\n\nI'm going through a separation with a woman who turned out to be a bitch and didn't really show her true colors until she landed a job. We got married abroad (international relationship). We came back to Canada last summer, she got her spouse visa in the fall, and she got a job in spring. \n\nThen right after she got the job, she wants a separation.. \"to get to know herself better or some BS\" Now she's been freaking out and going over the top. She's really shown her true colors. I see her on friday before work, then not again until sunday night. I'm fucking sick of this shit.\n\nNow, the part that may give me power/make me an asshole. A part of her visa stipulates that we MUST live together for 2 years after arriving (and getting her Visa) it's hasn't even been a year. I don't think she knows this. I told her well before we came to Canada, maybe she forgot. If I report her (or anyone does) she risks losing her VISA and getting deported back to her home country.\n\nBUT, On the other hand, if I DON'T report her or whatever, I am financially responsible for her for 3 years (which would make sense for a happily married couple..) but I don't want to be in that position. We haven't even been married for 2 years yet. \n\nSo, I'm all for the divorce. She's a bitch, she's trying to ruin my life now, and I (at the very least) don't want to be on the hook for this woman...\n\nWhat do!?!\n\n[EDIT]\n\nIt seems there are some comments that I haven't painted the whole picture, and that may be true indeed. But I didn't want to write my memoirs on here. I tried to give the basics without going into too much detail. Basically, our relationship started out with a lot of trust issues. Communication was always a bit of a problem, seeing we we had different first languages. She lied to me about seeing a guy at a bar, it was innocent, but the fact she had to lie and never apologized about it was rather disappointing.\n\nFast forward, we get married (things are not perfect, but no signs of major cracks) She stops having sex with me (this was the reason for this throwaway account.. i was lurking on /r/deadbedrooms), doing basic chores, just 'existing' but all the while critizising me. I suggest we go to counseling (for the third time. when I brought it up before she was aggressive and hesitant but claimed that she willing to go so long as I did all the leg work (basically she said she'd show up).\n\nWe did go (after arriving in Canada), showed no willingness to work together and try. She refused to communicate with me, tell me what she is feeling. She says she wants to stop wearing her wedding ring (now that she finally found a job). She said it was because it was \"uncomfortable\" or didn't want a tan line (since it was spring/summer). When finally i got it out of her, it was she wanted a separation.\n\nAnd so, here we are today. Her sexual neglect (and my inability to cope with it..?) and our terrible communication lead to the destruction of our marriage. If she married me only to come to Canada... then idk what the fuck to do.\nI just don't want to get into shit.\n\nAs an aside, I have spoken to our immigration lawyer who we used to process her visa. He said she'd face immigration charges, but neither of us should have criminal charges. And (although he doesn't handle divorce) because of our situation, the divorce proceedings should be super simple. He said we could do it ourselves.. Still going to get a second opinion form a divorce lawyer.\n",

So, me and my friend started to tag shit in Roberto's profil pic, after like 8/9 tags, we stopped because we thought no one deserves this type of hate.\n\nA few minutes later, his aunt (let's say her name is Roberta) commented: Nice looking man, nice car, nice lake (there was a lake on the picture) he replied: thanks :)\n\nI said to my friend that we should stop this mess, but, i couldn't resist to reply to his aunt: Nice loch ness monster (because my friend tagged Nessie - The loch ness monster where the lake is on this picture) then, the tales of Roberto begins.\n\nHe replied: Wtf man, seriously, get a life, what's the goal of all of this, be kind and stop this thing. Me and my friend (let's call my friend Rafael) decided to stop it, but, just before we where about to apologize, one of his friend (let's call him Gilipollas) replied: What are you doing here? F*ck, i understand why you're rejected by other people, stay in you goddamn hole, i hope that there's people like you in your planet!!\n\nGilipollas's friends decided to support him, he then commented: I'm so tired of those F*cking retards like him, the worst about that, is that he doesn't try to help himself, i don't have pity for this kind of people, you want to act like a disabled person, well, deal with it!\n\n\nI decided to get out of my hole, and i replied: When have I not fulfilled my retarded words? i know that some people hates me for the way i act, while other laugh (which makes me happy) and i'm not doing this to get attention from other people like you may think, if i would want attention, i would do it the easy way: wait that someone does something weird to be able to send a text full of insults in the face and recieve approval from friends (or if you prefer, what you did). The funniest part about your message, is that you're the type of people that offered help (even tho in the first place, i don't care because, my goal is not to look like a sheep)  and finally, i'm sorry, i didn't know if i tag random stuff on a picture, i'm automatically a retard, i guess you guys are more sensible than people on Reddit :)\n\n\nAfter being done with this message, i got a new one after a few seconds, this time it was from Kanker (one of Roberto's friends) it was saying: Yes, but f*ck men, go and at least comment other people's pictures, don't come and bully people that that doesn't have any f*cking connection with you! You think this is funny, but, we don't, and, we don't f*cking care about the tags, so, do this at least on pictures that you own.\n\n\nAfter reading Kanker's message, i decided to reply with this: I'm happy that you said yes at the beginning, because, if it was someone that tries hard to be mature, he wouldn't admit the points where he was wrong, anyway, i'm sorry if i was so offensive with you, i guess that if you tag random stuff on a picture, you deserves to get your ass kicked (let's see if you guys can found the sarcasm in this).\n\n\nKanker decided to reply: i don't see where we said that we wanted to kick your ass, we just want you to get out...in real life (in other words, to let them alone). \n\n\nI thought it was all, but nope, Gilipollas decided to comment: do ou think i'm only talking about what you just did right now? no, you doesn't seem right in your head, you're like this at school, or anywhere else. If my insults make you orgasm, well, let me tell you that you've found the right guy. No but seriously, there's other way to don't look like a sheep, anyway, say to yourself that we are really sensible, so, just go on your f*cking Reddit and leave us alone!\n\n\nIt's only the beginning, it getting worst from there, so, yeah, my question is, am i the asshole?\n\nAlso, i'm, once again, sorry for the way i acted, i didn't know that they where that sensible, i don't see what's wrong at tagging Lightning Flash McQueen on Roberto's car,Ent in one of Roberto's trees (Ents are those giant trees in the LOTR), Nessie on the lake that's on the picture and Butterfree on the random butterfly that on the picture.",

I mentioned that he has kids because it seems like I drive more often on nights when he evidently can't get enough sleep (because frankly, his kids run his household and he can't discipline them... But that's another story) and then he uses me to drive so he can just pass out in the passenger seat. When I am riding in his car, I make a conscious effort to be awake, attentive and generally available for whatever - also because of his apparent lack of sleep, I've had to forcefully tell him to pull over and take over because he was pinballing off the rumble strips.\n\nTo me, it just seems disrespectful.

    "selftext": "I made friends with a girl. We clicked over our mutual sense of humor, our social awkwardness, and tendency to give way too much info. We hung out 4 or 5 times before this incident. \n\nWe were in my car and a guy pulled into the spot next to us really fast. She said, unprompted, \"this is probably bad but I just knew that guy would be black.\" \n\nI explained why I thought that was uncool but she didn't care, she even said that \"living in L.A. has turned her into a bit of a racist.\" It didn't take me long to realize this attitude wouldn't change. To be clear, I'd never encountered her attitude this way before, so it's not like she's a straight up white supremacist, but as someone who is working hard to overcome my own biases, this made me really uncomfortable. \n\nSo, I kinda just started avoiding her, telling her I was busy, couldn't hang out, whatever. Eventually she caught on and asked me what happened, why we never hung out anymore, but I just didn't answer. I didn't want it to turn into some argument about racism, and I'm a huge pushover and knew I'd put away my discomfort to get someone to like me. I probably should have responded, but I hate confrontation and didn't want to second guess my decision or anything. I mean, she literally said she was a racist and wasn't ashamed of it.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "This is a long one, so bear with me.\n\nAll names are fake, to protect all parties, both assholes and non-assholes. I am 19 years old.\n\nMy friend Jeremy had a new years eve party at his house. His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren't around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen's best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \n\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn't going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she's still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can't do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I'm home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\n\n \"pantherlax56 I'm not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\n\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I'm home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\n\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I'm ready to party with my friends I haven't seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \n\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\n\n because he couldn't deal with her constant mentions of me. We're both pretty drunk, and he says, \n\n\"hey dude, its Lola's birthday today. If you wanna make someone's day, text her.\"\n\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she's \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she's in nursing classes). I think to myself: \n\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\n2. She told me she didn't want a relationship either, just to hang out\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\n\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \n\n\"so what does this mean?\" \n\nand I ask, \n\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\n\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\n\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven't changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn't talk to me.\n\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen's parents. My best friend's mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy's, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy's parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \n\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I'm a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\n\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\n\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn't just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. \n\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn't want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn't into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won't get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\n\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally. Also remember that she was 17, only 2 years younger than me at the time.",

    "selftext": "I have a group chat on facebook with three of my closest friends. We either plan a meetup there or we just talk about random stuff. This guy I'm referring to in the title is a guy who I've known for years. Quiet as fuck on social occasions, socially awkward and always a little behind. He's often by himself alone at home and playing video games or something. Doesn't always understand simple stuff, his logic is off many times but other than that he's just a regular guy. \n\nWith his background in mind I'm going to tell you what has happened. When this guy is in a bad mood or if we've called him out on being stupid about something (not in a bad way but I understand that from his perspection it may seem like we're acting more smart than him and that makes him feel dumb) time passes by and when you say something normal he just says Shut Up (most of the time, sometimes he says other stuff) to me (not the other guys for the most part). It annoys me so much because there is no reason for saying that to your friends. Keep in mind that when we call him out we only explain the more logical way of thinking but like I previously said that probably sounds like we're mean to him from his perspective. Also because we're more people against him alone. \n\nAnyways this last night he said ''Gay'' to one of my normal texts in the chat randomly. I replied ''Don't be an old granny (referring to being bitter) and type Shut Up, it shows thay you're bitter and moody'' (he had been saying that previously this night). He replies with ''Gay'' again. I tell him that he acts like a little kid and has no logic. He replies with ''Eat poop''. Saying stuff like this could be funny when you were like 15 but we've grown out of it, except he hasn't. The words he usually uses are Shut Up though. When I call him out on acting like a kid he often says that he's just joking. It's obvious that he isn't and that he just lets out his inner aggression feelings on me in this chat when he's having a bad day.\n\nI want to know if I'm the asshole here since I feel like a bully sometimes because he's all alone in his opinions and actions while I have backup from my friends. I'd more importantly would like to know how to handle the situation going forward. Preferably a way to make him stop being a bitch and not by just cutting him off as a friend like I imagine most of you will say. Calling him out in chat doesn't seem to work but when we meet in real life he's quiet as usual which is also annoying. Be a man and say it to my face for fucks sake. Previously I told him that I would fight him if he didn't stop and that I didn't care if he said he was joking. That made him stop for a pretty long period of time but it has started again. I understand that this will sound like a problem a fucking 12 year old has but it is what it is and I want your opinion. We're young adults all of us.",

    "selftext": "Ok, so last year I ended a friendship with a longtime friend, and she seems to be wanting to move past it, but I am feeling like I don't want to, am I being an asshole?\n\n\nThe backstory is that we were in a friend group in high school that hung out together all the time, and at the base of that group were four girls, including me.  I was extremely close with the one (we'll call her Kay), and good friends with the other two (we'll call them Ali and Jess).  Ali is the friend I'm talking about now.  After we graduated we all went off to colleges in different states and slowly grew apart.  Jess dropped off the face of the earth completely, and I vaguely kept in email contact with Kay and Ali.  Ali dropped out and moved back home, but she worked really hard and has an awesome job, so she's been doing well.  I never thought I'd move back even remotely close to where I grew up, but I ended up going to graduate school about 2 hours away from where I grew up, and I reconnected with Ali.  We grew up in a small town, so she always wanted to come visit me to come to the big city, and I would visit her occasionally, but not nearly as often as she would come to see me.  Typically her visits involved her going to some event, like a concert or sporting event and she would crash at my place.\n\n\nSo the start of the fall out started a few years ago when I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was really sick and in the hospital and I talked to her about visiting, she said she was slammed at work and couldn't make it, but she sent a card and a gift.  No big deal, I totally understood.  Fast forward about six months, she came into town to visit, I was on the mend.  We go out to lunch and I was telling her how hard everything had been, she says now that I've opened up she should as well.  That she had been lying about being single for all these years, and that she'd actually had a boyfriend for about two years.  She said the reason she hadn't told me was because it was scandalous, and I was thinking maybe he was married or something.  Then she tells me its because he's black.  I found this really offensive, because I could care less about that, and if she knew me at all she would know that.  I brought up that Jess is black and dated white guys and none of us thought anything of that, so why would this be any different.  She was like oh well I just didn't know if you were racist or not.  So I was already mad, but then she tells me that she's been coming to town about every week with him to go to events and stuff, but never told me because she didn't want me to know about him.  So she didn't come visit me when I was in the hospital with cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend.\n\n\nThe second strike is our beach trip a few months later.  We had already planned and paid for it when I found this out, so I decided to suck it up and try to make it as fun as possible.  We go out one night, I drove and was DD, she proceeds to get trashed, and cause a scene at the bar we were at.  She invited two guys back to our place even though we both have boyfriends, and I had to tell them they were not actually invited and to leave us alone, and she starts yelling at me about how I'm such a worrier and that nothing was going to happen and I'm no fun, etc etc.  I drove us back to our condo and I was pissed.  I mostly read on the beach the next day, and I didn't drive us to go back out, and then I went straight home.  \n\n\nStrike three for me was kinda two things together, but they were similar.  The first was her coming to visit to go to something during the day and wanted me to go with her, I told her I had to work and couldn't.  I worked all day and then went out that night, and she thought this was rude because I said I couldn't hang out.  Then I was supposed to see her before Thanksgiving and ended up having to work, I warned her a week in advance that I wouldn't be able to make it, and she told me to text her the day of to confirm.  I said ok, but then I forgot, because I was focused on work, and at 4pm she texted me and said \"I guess you're not coming\" I told her that I had already let her know and was going to text her when I got home.  I apologized and said that maybe I didn't come across clear, but that I thought I had let her know.  She said that our friendship doesn't seem like a priority to me and that I'm a shitty friend.  So I told her if that's how she feels then great, but I don't care because I'm done being friends with someone who treats me the way that she does.  I haven't talked to her again since.\n\n\nRecently, she has been emailing saying she misses me and wants to move past everything and be friends again.  I don't have any interest in trying to work through that with her, and I'd rather her not be in my life.  Am I being the asshole?  Should I try to work things out?  Was I wrong?  Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR; My longtime friend didn't visit me when I had cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend because she didn't know if I was racist (I'm not), she was a drunken rude mess on our beach trip, and told me I'm a shitty friend for having to cancel on her because of work, am I the asshole for ending our friendship and not wanting to mend it?",

Let's call him Bryant.\n\nBryant and I were close because of our shared interests. He liked video games and I liked video games, but it all started to go down hill when we became juniors. Around the beginning of that year, I got a girlfriend. Being a relationship noob of sorts, I didn't know how to manage time and essentially say 'no.' to both my friends and my new girlfriend. After 3 months, the relationship ended and my friendships suffered.\n\nAfter this, a month of hanging out with other people had lessened the tensions with my original group of friends, and I had rejoined them.

Time passes.\n\nNow Bryant isn't having a good home life.

Now, he's on vacation outside of the state, a fair bit away. He isn't speaking to anyone save a few people.\n\nI've lost patience, and even if he had one suicide scare a long time ago, I'm finding it hard to be considerate of his feelings when he says things like \"my life is full of despair and you have so much hope.\"",

It's a big open floor with a barrier up front. You can't reserve a spot anywhere. If you leave your spot, you do not get it back if you change your mind.\n\n This was an all day festival (Summer Slaughter 2014) and my girlfriend and I had spent a pretty long time trying to get a spot up front at the barrier. We got up there just in time for the headliner, and the woman next to me was *very* drunk. She spent the entirety of the previous set jabbing her elbow into my rib cage (issue number 1). As soon as the final set started, she tried grinding on every guy around us, and grabbing at all of our crotches (issue number 2).\n\nSuddenly she turns around and leaves, someone else takes her place against the barrier, so we thought we were done dealing with her. A little while later, she decides she wants her spot back, so she comes back up, puts her hands on the barrier on either side of my girlfriend, and squeezes as hard as she can (issue number 3). I offered to switch places with my girlfriend so she could enjoy the show, but she said she'd rather be squeezed than have some random drunk chick grabbing my johnson. Fair enough. My girlfriend is not a big girl (5'2, 115 pounds) and she was clearly in a lot of pain. \n\nI tried asking a security guard for some help, but during the headliner of the show they were too busy catching crowd surfers to notice.\n\nTo solve this, I would throw my head in her direction while headbanging, hoping a face full of sweaty hair would make her want to leave. When it didn't, I forcibly pulled her hands off of the barrier and away from my girlfriend. When she kept putting her hands there and trying to squeeze the life out of my girlfriend, I turned around and screamed \"There is no room for you. Leave.\" in her face. She then turns to my girlfriend and asks if she wants to go outside to fight her (issue number 4). \n\nI again looked for security guards to help, but they were still all too busy.\n\nEventually, I'm tired of all of this. Being groped, jabbed with her elbows, her hurting my girlfriend, asking her to fight, and continuing to do this even though I, and everyone else around me, had told her to stop and that there just wasn't enough room for her, especially considering that *she* was the one that decided to give up her spot, and *we weren't even the ones that took her spot*. So the next time I turned around, I \"accidentally* elbowed her in the nose. \n\nShe still continued doing what she was doing, until finally a security guard caught on to what was happening, and pulled her off the floor.\n\nWas what I did going too far?",

One lone guy was standing in front of the hose, which was streaming over him as he waved two flags.

How would you like to get blasted in the head with a water canon at a political protest? Would you laugh watching videos of blacks get hosed in Birmingham in the civil rights era?\", I asked\n\nHe was taken aback and tried to say \"I didn't mean it like that\". I wanted to say \"then why the fuck did you clap?\", but he already had that whipped puppy look so I left it at that.\n\nI later approached the cadet and said that I didn't want there to be any hard feelings, but I just feel very strongly about people getting fucked up by their government and I wanted him to consider what's going on in Turkey.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n[1]cadet = kinda like an intern. For context, he's no more than 3 years younger than I am and it's a pretty informal work environment. Casual cursing and jokes of a sexual nature are not uncommon. You'd have to go pretty far to be worried about getting fired under an HR claim. We are mariners, after all. This is just the first time I've ever seen someone laugh at something like a political protestor getting jacked up by the police.\n\nEdit: formatting.\n",

They own a decent size ranch that I was helping them work on. One day they all went into town and I was there alone. I decided to try to do something productive so I went to go take out the trash and then go clean the barn. I went outside and got in the truck to head out. As I opened the door one of their dog's jumped in the back as usual, no problem... Until I got to the barn, forgot the dog was in their and locked him in the blazing summer sun. I ended up dicking around playing on my phone and whatnot after finishing cleaning. About two hours had passed since I had left him in there. I opened the truck door to hear him panting and whimpering and immediately realized I fucked up. Me not having a drivers license or even knowing where a vet was drove as fast as I could to the house to get on the phone and call my cousins to tell them what was happening. No one picked up... I'm in a panic... Realizing he is burning I decide he needs water. I drive him back to the hose to pour cold water all over him and attempt to make him drink some. Then I see a truck. Thank God! One of my cousin's is back. I run to tell him what happened. He comes over as fast as he can and at this point I think the dog has bitten his tongue because he is bleeding from the mouth. As we drive to the vet I tell my cousin that I had found him like this by the pond(to explain the wetness) We got him to the vet and they told us that his insides had burned up from the heat. We got a call back the next day for them to tell us he died. We then drive back to pick up the body. Surprisingly when we got there there was about a dozen dogs in the freezer that I can only assume had a similar unfortunate fate. Later that day I helped bury that dog in their woods. I think it's been about two years and I still haven't told them. At first it was out of fear and now I just feel like it's a little too late to even mention it. So am I an asshole for not telling them?\n\nTLDR: I forgot my cousins dog in a truck. He burned to death. I didn't tell them.",

Unfortunately most of my dating history is \"girls I work with\" despite the old advice that you shouldn't do that at all.\n\nThis is one of the two things in the story that I just can't help myself with. So she sees me everyday for a couple of weeks. We talk a lot. She's older and Im told I should date older women because people my age are kind of just how young people tend to be.\n\nI tell her there's an event in town after work and she should come to it with me. She agrees to meet me there. We listen to some music, drink. I've run into another friend there who encourages me to go home with the girl. The girl invites me to another party \"near\" her place. Im surprised to find out this wasn't a hook. there was in fact another party..... A very hippoie/flowerchild whatever kind of party.\n\nThis is not my thing so I drink my beer and try to keep my mouth shut. We work for a corporation so this was highly unexpected. Eventually she says she's bored and wants to go home. We are both quite drunk but her house isn't far and she drives me to it. It's important to note I've left my car in town.\n\nSo we're at her house and at every turn she's just mildly bringing up these topics and Im just lightly batting them out of the way while we drink wine. I am in her house. I am in her house. I am in her house. Slow debate begins to form. I am now in her bedroom. The discussion is heating up. Im on her bed and finally I can't control my pride anymore. The passively one-sided discussion of Mother Earth and LSD has become a full on argument in about 5 minutes.\n\nWe stop talking, go outside. Nothing happened. We're drinking and I quote a book or something stupid and ill advised and she says \"You can't even think for yourself you have to use authors to back you up?\"  She is angry and I just can't help myself. I have to  continue to argue and continue to come off as pretentious and finally just shrug her off. So it is clear to me this night cannot be saved.\n\nI finish my wine, she offers to drive me back to my car. We stop at a gas station. She tells me to get out. I do. I walk a mile and a half to my car at midnight. Fuck her i think, but it's understandable I was being a jerk by the end of it.\n\nI come into work Monday. She doesn't come by the desk (obviously).

My parents will ask me occassionally(as im sure all parents do) to pick up milk or some groceries from the store. I don't mind the chore, I like getting out and driving and walking around. However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill). Then, when I ask to be paid for it, my mother gets up in arms over asking for my money back. She uses arguments like, \"Oh well, I buy you things when im at the store and I don't ask you to pay me\" or \"When I was your age, Id buy my moms stuff because I loved my mommy so much.\", which to me doesn't make sense seeming how I pick up what I need or ask if they want me to pay them for any groceries I put on the list. The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11. Another factor that may play in is after my grandfather died, he left me a substantial amount of money to help pay for college, which my mother believes she was cheated out of. I already have lent her about $500 with her not paying that back yet, arguing that it shouldve been hers anyway. I feel I should mention my mom is on disability and my dad works full time. I guess, I want my money back, because I know if I don't ask in the moment, my mothers going to think that everytime she sends me to the store that Ill just cover it and end up making my lists so much longer and more expensive since I \"have the money to afford it anyway.\" What do you think here?\n\nTL:DR- I want my money back from either lending it to my mom or going on errands, while she believes that shes entitled to them as \"gifts\" or something.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, my first post, so here goes nothing:\n\nThis happened this morning, just a few minutes ago.\n\nI was on my way to work, stopped at the convenience store on the other side of the parking lot from work, and my girlfriend (who also works with me) came with.  On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I \"didn't want to have anything to do with that.\"  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.\n\nAnyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, \"That was highly inappropriate,\"  I said back, \"Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...\"  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, \"You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.\"\n\nNow, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, \"Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.\"  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.\n\nLet me give you a little back story, so you know the context.\n\nI've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.\n\nWe have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.\n\nShe didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.\n\nI brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?\n\nTL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would \"fucking kill me\".  This was right after I had said to my girlfriend (within earshot of this coworker) that I didn't want to have anything to do with the conversation she and this coworker were having together.

    "selftext": "Yes, I know another relationship story, but please hold with me.\n\nA bit of **backstory**: Me and this girl (let's call her Shelby) dated for a while during 2014 and the beginning of 2015. It ended with both of us still having a lot of feelings for each other, but her parents did not approve of me (2 years older) and so the relationship ended. \n\n**Main story**: A couple months go by and we have barely talked at all since the breakup when she texts me talking about how she still thinks about me everyday and can't get over me. Meanwhile, I have mostly moved on and am talking to another girl.\n\n I still have feelings for my ex, just not very intense feelings anymore (however, I could see my bond with her reviving to what it once was though if we were to get back together). However, I play up my feelings for her and say how I miss her very much and wish we could get back together. I did this because I wanted to increase my odds of having a relationship either with Shelby or the other girl (say Emily). I keep talking with both girls for about 2 weeks until I finally ask Emily out on a date (as she had recently broken up with now ex-bf and I was giving her some time). She said yes. \n\nNow with a secured relationship, I thought it necessary to cut things off with my ex so as to not lead her on or cause problems in the new relationship. This is the conversation of me calling it off.\n\nShelby: \"You are looking hella schnazy.\"\n\nMe: \"I think you should move on from me. It's not psychologically healthy for either of us to not do so. sorry.\"\n\nShelby: Mentions how she knows I've already moved on and she's tried but can't. Says guys keep trying to \"hook up with her\" but they're \"not me\". Regrets treating me poorly when we dated *she was often aloof* and regrets breaking up with me.\n\nMe: \"Just use this as a learning experience. Treat the next guy the comes along better. And duh there will be more. I'm not perfect *as she often claimed which made me uncomfortable*, far from it. Stop trying to hold onto the past, it really is unhealthy (I've done the same before). But man we're done, we've been done since we had to break up. No point in fighting it.\"\n\nMe: \"please stop texting things like that as its bad for you and makes me uncomfortable, plus there is someone else and I doubt she would appreciate it either. Sorry but this is the way it has to be. It was always going to have to be like this since, ya know, you weren't supposed to date me in the first place.\n\nShelby: calls me an asshole, tells me to say \"Shelby get out of my fucking life\", wishes I'd have broke it off earlier so she could block me on everything, is now suddenly glad she broke up with me, mentions how she actually got permission to date me from her parents finally and would have this summer if I didn't turn out to be such a dick.\n\nAnd the conversation goes downhill from there.\n\n**So here are the questions.**\n1) Am I an asshole for trying to set up a relationship with two girls at the same time and \"keeping my options open\"?\n2) Was I tactless in this situation causing her to get extremely pissed, or was there no real easy way to let her down and still get the message across that there's no chance for us? Specifically, should I not have mentioned the other girl?\n\n**Story wrap-up**: Shelby still hates me; Emily broke up with me cause she wasn't over her ex. My plan for securing a relationship with one of the two worked perfectly! *sarcasm*\n\n**TL;DR**: I carried out *preliminary* relationships with two girls at once and then called it off with one when I got in a relationship with the other.\n\nEdit was simply adding the TL;DR",

    "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying all involved parties are high schoolers. That's why this will probably sound stupid.\n\nLast year I dated this girl, let's call her Allie. Allie was..well..kind of a nymphomaniac. She'd been with more guys than she could remember, and she's done basically everything. If you think I'm exaggerating..I won't go into graphic detail, but it's more than any of you are thinking.\n\nIn contrast, I had yet to go beyond kissing a girl, and was, honestly, super excited. However, we both had big issues with depression, and so I ended up breaking up with her after about two months. The reason for this is that she was incredibly attached to me, and she was becoming unhealthily obsessed. I knew she'd never be truly happy if she depended on me as a crutch, so I tried to stand by her as a friend, telling her that maybe once we'd figured ourselves out we could try again.\n\nLater that year, she disappeared. Signed out of every class, just...gone. It honestly messed me up really badly. I was 90% sure that she'd killed herself. No social media updates, no indicators at all. I moved on with life, and had a couple other casual relationships, but they always felt kind of empty. All the time apart made me realize how badly I actually needed her as much as she'd needed me.\n\nFlash forward to about a month ago, and I see that she's updated Facebook again. I messaged her immediately, and we made plans to hang out. Turns out she'd gone to a mental health facility for teens, and she would be moving back within a month. We meet up, at the topic of dating gets brought up. She says that when she moves back (she was visiting home) in around a month, then we can try again. However, she says *once she's settled back in* we'll try again. Now, I was fine with this, because of course she'll need readjusting time. \n\nShe moved back almost 20 days ago, which is to my mind, adequate settling in time. No worries though, I totally respect that she has some things left to sort through. The difficult part is finding out what she's been doing during that time- the answer being multiple other guys. I guess she thinks since we aren't dating again yet, there's no commitment, and I suppose that's true. However, She knows that we might get back together soon, and is still just fucking everyone who asks. (Her reputation gets around.) I held out on \"serious\" (high school) relationships waiting for her to get back, and I feel kind of violated knowing that she's banging everyone in sight. I feel kind of betrayed, and I want to break things off, but multiple people have said that since we aren't officially dating yet, it shouldn't bother me.\n\nSo reddit, am i the asshole?",

The pedestrian walkway starts in a residential area and all parking spots around the residential area are for cars with permit only. I drove around until the parking spots didn't require a permit and I parked in the first spot I found (in front of the house above).

I also had a friend that I've known for 15 years, and my father and his were best friends. Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\n\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half. He wasn't there growing up, and so me and this friend weren't best friends, but we were still friends.\n\nTL;DR Oldest friends slutty fiance doesn't like me, and we got into it.

If it's important for me to describe \"both sides in detail,\" I have to mention that he and I hadn't had the same afternoon off in quite a while and I'd been asking him to ball with me for over a year!\n\nThe local park near his new apartment was the perfect spot for a game. Public pool, HUGE playground and jungle gym, soccer field, and a full covered, regulation sized basketball court. \"Wanna warm up with a game of horse?\" I ask. He agrees, and we start shooting, running, and rebounding. We keep it half court, because a 50-something father and his teenage children had started a two-on-two game of their own on the other side.\n\nBy the time my bf accumulates an H, O, and R (I had less; ball is life), a tall 30-something father walks into the court area, straight towards our basket with his two sons. The older son could not have been more than FIVE years old. His younger brother, still all bald-headed with his natal-headed self, could not have been more than TWO years old. My boyfriend and I stop, double take both each other and the scene as the dad says to his children \"Go ahead, guys. Take some shots.\" It takes the 5YO attempting two or three shots with a MINIATURE foam basketball that fail to reach even two feet below the REGULATION SIZED basket for my boyfriend and I to dribble around the three point line whispering to each other \"What do we do?\" The dad registers our reaction and calls out \"Hey guys, you can keep shooting!\" Sure, sir. Can't wait to see how you react if one of our shots accidentally bricks off the hoop and slams into your tiny child's tiny child mouth. We try to take shots, and it's impossible. The kids are up against the basket (still 0 PPG by my count), and we feel uncomfortable playing at our previous, desired speed. \nCool dad sees us again discussing our options on the sidelines (which, I'll be honest, was me hissing at my boyfriend to not let the dad hear our laments outloud), and he says \"Y'all can keep going! We didn't mean to interrupt anything!\" The bf and I are not combative people, so after less than 10 minutes of total game play, he and I leave the park and walk back home.\n\nOne the walk back home he and I furiously threw out sentences to pinpoint why we felt so shitty about what just happened. \"In any neighborhood basketball court ANYwhere, dibs are dibs.\" \"Agism? He didn't try interrupting the OTHER family's game. Would he have done that if we were both grown men?\" \"What were we gonna do? Call out this dude in front of his children?\" \"THE FUCK ARE CHILDREN GONNA DO ON REGULATION SIZED SHIT?!\" We agreed the appropriate response could have been \"Sir, we were in the middle of a game. Would you like us to give you ten or so minutes to shoot around?\" but Are We the young childless Assholes for getting so angry at Cool Dad? ",

He's the kind of person who will be friendly around you, but will never want to talk to you or invite you to things  if he doesn't need to/loses interest. He used to invite me to all his small events, but nowadays he is throwing parties constantly, and Ryan and Mike are constantly going. I knew this because Ash posts pictures on Snapchat, so I'm always seeing these. So on top of the fact that I don't get invited, I also have to tap through a photo collection featuring Ryan and Mike partying with Ash.\nThe thing is, Ryan and Mike won't admit they're doing anything with Ash. I asked them what they did the day after the party, and they just say they did nothing. They're intentionally hiding the fact that they're going, and especially the fact that I don't get invited to their events. This hurts, because I asked Ryan if Ash does anything anymore, and he says that Ash hasn't been doing anything recently. They won't admit anything's happening, \n\nSo this is where the AITA comes in:\nLately I've been hosting movie nights, because Ryan once mentioned that he'd like to start them. At first, I was planning on having Ryan and Mike over for them, because I didn't yet know they were lying to me. Now, I only invite friends I made from college, as well as the few high-school friends who I still keep in contact with. I intentionally try not to invite Ryan and Mike. They might already know I'm doing this, but they haven't said anything about it.\n\ntl;dr - Am I the asshole for leaving out two friends from movie night because they don't want to admit they go party with someone whose intentionally leaving me out?",

    "selftext": "Generally, I love treating my family and friends to things. I don't have a lot of money (making about 30-40k a year while finishing my masters), but I also don't have any kids and prefer being single so I'm mostly into non-serious dating. My brothers have wives and kids, so they don't have the same amount of expendable cash. \n\nI'm currently talking with a coworker about going to a sporting event within the next few weeks, but I hesitate to invite my brothers. I invited my dad since I owe my parents so much, so I don't mind paying for a ticket for him, but I know if I ask my brothers, one of three things will happen. First and simplest is that they won't want to go (highly unlikely). Second is that they'll say yes, but not  be able to afford it at which point I'll feel bad and end up paying for tickets for all of us (myself, my dad, and my brothers). Third and more likely is that they'll want to go, can't afford the more expensive tickets I want to get and will talk me into getting cheap nose bleed tickets. We almost always go this route and it would be nice to actually be able to see the fights without looking at a screen. Money is a subject I hesitate to bring up with them, so I wouldn't fight them if they wanted to go this route.\n\nAll of that being said, I've been holding off on asking them if they want to go and may eventually just not say anything about it. They'll eventually find out since my coworker is friends with them as well and my dad is going to go. To add to this, and this may sound petty, I was pretty let down on my birthday by the fact that I received very little from my brothers. One brother, in fact, gave me nothing. I know I shouldn't expect anything in return, but I do go out of my way to get them, and their families, as much as I can for the holidays and their birthdays, but I never see anywhere near the same amount from them. Last year, I spent close to a thousand dollars on their families for Christmas and was given less than $100 in gifts. I love giving, but after a while it feels completely one sided. It doesn't help that I feel the adults exchanging gifts is silly and the gift giving should be limited to the children, mostly because of this very reason. Even if things were completely even, we are essentially exchanging same valued gift cards which doesn't make sense.\n\nAm I the asshole for being selfish and wanting to have good seats without having to shell out hundreds of dollars for everyone for a change? \n\nPS: Found this sub today while reading a random thread on another forum.

She looks good, and I am totally sexually attracted. However she ofcourse wants a relationship. I can't imagine myself loving her, heck I can't even imagine us holding hands.

    "selftext": "  Recently my older brother (**33**) came back from Seattle.  Since he's gotten back he hasn't really done anything as far as being a productive member of society.  He lived with my girlfriend and I for a few month when he got back.  During the time he lived with me he did nothing to get a job or find a place to live.  He bought groceries but complained that I wanted 300/month for rent so I didn't charge him rent.  \n\n  I guess he felt that he was no longer welcome because he moved in with a mutual friend who also was charging 300/month for rent but my brother actually pays him. Since then he hasn't really done a whole lot beyond drinking.  He has plenty of money as we both got a good chunk of change when my mom passed away two years ago.  I chose to take less money in exchange for her house, which my brother agreed too so I bought his half of the house from the will.  \n\n  So literally he has three bills a month to pay.  Cellphone bill, Car insurance and rent.  He neglected to pay his car insurance for some amount of time and his insurance company reported it to the state who in turn revoked the registration on his car for 3 months.  Now he has to turn the plates to his car in and where he lives can only park it on a public road where it will get towed without the plates on it. The most aggravating part about this is when I talked to him, he blames the insurance company.  I asked him how it was anyone's fault but his own and got no reply. My girlfriend and I both don't want to let him park his car here for 3 months.  \n\n  I feel like he needs to get his shit together and be responsible human being and that I also shouldn't have to be responsible for his life decisions. I have tried to do what I can for him but if he continues to chose not to do anything productive or be responsible for his own actions, I cannot continue to make his issues my issues.",

    "selftext": "I hope this isn't too long, but the sidebar says \"describe both sides in detail,\" so I'll try to be as impartial and detailed as possible. I'll put a TL;DR at the end.\n\nSome context: I'm a 20 year old single male in Ontario.\n\nSo, I recently changed up my Tinder profile. Two or three days ago, I matched with this girl whose profile said that she's 19 and that she was only a few kilometers away from me. We started talking a lot, but only about silly superficial stuff like how our summers are going, TV shows, etc...\n\nShe is mad cute (I swear I'm not saying this as a humble-brag haha. She looks like a younger Eliza Coupe, but with red hair and imo slightly prettier). Despite that, I didn't ask her on a date because she seemed a little immature. However, this morning, she messaged me saying that she had her apartment to herself and asked if I wanted to come over. So obviously I accepted and bussed over.\n\nSo I get to her building, I ask to meet outside (because safety first!), we both verify that the other person is indeed real and not a scary old man, and then we go inside and start making out.\n\nJust to reiterate, we basically knew nothing about each other because we kept our messages the past few days very casual. Anyways, before we progress past making out, she tells me that she's a virgin. To be honest, I didn't really believe her at that point (because she invited me over despite never having met before, and it was hard to believe that it was the first time she did something like that). However, I'm now pretty sure that she was telling the truth because there was a bit of blood when we first started and it also unfortunately seemed to hurt her a little bit. Anyways, so she asked me to be gentle and she said she was nervous, so we talked a bit before we actually had sex and I told her that we didn't have to do anything she wasn't comfortable with and that she shouldn't feel pressured or rushed, especially with a guy she just met. But she said she was down, and so we did the deed.\n\nSo afterwards, we laid in her bed chatting. After a bit, we got dressed and I asked her if she would mind giving me a ride back to my place (I bussed over). She said that she couldn't because she only had her learner's permit (and in Ontario, that means that you can't drive without having an experienced driver in the front seat). So I jokingly asked her why she took so long to get her license (her Tinder profile said she's 19) and she told me that she actually turned 16 a few weeks ago.\n\nI was literally in shock. I was so mad because I was under the impression that she was 19, and I just found out that I had sex with a 16-year old. In her defense, she never explicitly *told* me that she's 19 or lied about her age, but I assumed that her Tinder profile was accurate. Also, at this point, I legitimately thought that I just unknowingly did something illegal by having sex with a minor (thankfully I Googled it later and it turns out the age of consent in Canada is 16 so I'm safe, but still! If it was even a month or two ago, I could be in some deep legal trouble just because she lied on her profile.)\n\nIn retrospect, I'm not proud of this, but I flipped the fuck out and got so mad, especially because I was really worried that I did something that could get me in a lot of trouble. She started crying and she told me that she didn't think the age discrepancy was a big deal, but I couldn't bring myself to apologize because I was fuming so I just left and bussed back home. (Side note: I didn't say anything deliberately hurtful, call her any names, or say anything even remotely like a personal attack. It was more so a rant about how I couldn't believe she thought not telling me about her age was OK.)\n\nAfter I cooled off a bit, I messaged her saying that I was sorry for being angry but she hasn't responded yet.\n\nAt the time, I felt that I was completely justified in my anger. However, now that I think about it, I'm worried that I may have been an asshole. From her perspective, it must have sucked to have a guy she just had sex with flip out on her. Especially since it was her first time ever, and she may very well have been in a vulnerable place emotionally. To make matters even worse, at the risk of sounding patronizing, we all made stupid choices at the age of 16 and I maybe could have been more understanding. I really do feel bad now, but aside from sending her another apology message I don't know what to do. And, to be fair, I still think that I had every right to be upset - I probably should have just handled it better.\n\nI told a few friends before I went to her place that I was meeting with a girl from Tinder, but I haven't told anyone yet about us having sex, about her being 16, or about my angry reaction. That's why I'm here - I want some impartial and honest opinions about whether or not I am an asshole, and in addition, what I should have done instead. Thanks in advance.\n\nTL;DR: Had sex with a Tinder match who was a virgin and whose profile said she was 19, turned out she's only 16, got really angry. AITA?",

I am walking down a grassy trail to the path i go running on. i am currently very focused on physical fitness thanks to r/ fitness, but that's off topic. i am strolling along when i almost step on a little helpless bird whose wing seemed to be broken. i gently cup him in my hands and begin to examine the poor little guy. his wing bones were protruding from his little broken wings and his feathers also seemed to be falling out. I'm no veterinarian, but this bird seemed to be in bad shape. all i know is that he couldn't preform his core function as a bird, which was to fly. the way i saw it i had 3 options, leave him, try to nurse him back to health, or to end his suffering. i contemplating leaving him. but with the extreme heat, and large feral cat problem my home town has, i felt like it would be too cruel to do to the little guy. another option would have been to bring the bird home and try to nurse him back to health. i seriously considered this option. he was very cute and i love animals. but i then thought about some other birds i tried to nurse back to health. in short, most of the birds i had tried this with had died within the first day and were in much better condition than this one. i had finally decided to end his misery. i cupped the little guy gently in my hands once again and sadly walked to a puddle. we had recently gotten a lot of rain so these puddles were fairly deep. i slowly lowered my closed hand and held the injured bird under. in under ten seconds, the bubbles stopped. i buried him in the best stone grave i could make with my bare hands and walked home feeling sick to my stomach. ill let you guys decide, am i the a*shole?",

    "selftext": "So here's some backstory:\n\n\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 2 years old and my whole life I've had four families. I would mostly live with my mother and step dad, and would visit my father and step mom every other weekend. My dad is the kind of person that the good times are great, and the bad times are horrible. I remember him yelling and hitting me when I would visit sometimes, but there were also great times where I bonded with my dad. Around my junior year in HS I started to get really sick of going up to visit him. I would have to use MY gas money now to drive two hours upstate to be away from my friends and to be in a house with a crazy family. To my dads credit, he would always drive round trip 4 hours to pick me up every weekend up until I could drive. At this point he had the same wife, who always seemed so fake to me, a daughter(my half sister who I liked) and an terrible son(cursing hitting screaming at his mom at 5 years old) who, from what I assume came from my fathers actions toward him that I had experience in a small dose. Another thing I should point out is that since I was the oldest sibling in my dad and step moms family, they weren't very experience with parenting a 17 year old. They treated me like I was a little kid still. This one instance sticks out to me: we were at an Applebee's and a big UFC fight was on(I can't remember which one) but I asked the waitress to change the channel to put it on. She came back and said that the manger wouldn't allow it because of how violent it was. I guess my dad and step mom didn't realize what I was asking to put on the TV before, but they starting apologizing for me ASKING to put on MMA. In a bar. Where there was boxing on the other TV to the left. \"Oh we're so sorry, we didn't realize that he wanted THAT on.\" Like I was just a stupid little kid. Anyways, the rest of my dads family I LOVED, and still do. My cousin was one of my best friends but I haven't spoken to him for about a year(I'll get to that in a little bit)\n\n\n\n\nIn my junior year of HS I played baseball for the varsity team so I pretty much stopped visiting during baseball season, but he understood. In the summer between my junior and senior year, he gave me his car as my birthday present (2006 Chrysler 300). In the fall of my senior year, It was my responsibility to drive 2 hours to his house to visit every other weekend. But I didn't want to put up with him being an asshole, or his douchebag son and fake wife so I made up excuses as to why I couldn't visit. I probably visited one weekend a month during that fall.  Fast forward to about two weeks before Christmas, he texts me and asks me when I was going to visit(my parents always split Christmas and Christmas Eve). I told him that id go up 3 days before Christmas Eve and leave Christmas Day to go to my moms house. He was NOT happy with this. He wanted me to spend my whole 2 week vacation before Christmas with him and come back to my moms on Christmas Day. I told him no way and went up 3 days before Christmas Eve. So we were already fighting, and every visit to his house sucked. Fast forward to Christmas Eve- my dads whole family is over for dinner, and we hadn't been talking for the 3 days before at all. I am trying to make my plate of food,  and here he comes telling me how to make my plate of food. Thanks dad, I'm SEVENTEEN FUCKING YEARS OLD I KNOW HOW TO MAKE MY PLATE OF FOOD BY NOW. I tell him to \"get out of my face\". Well he doesn't like this very much and in front of his whole family says he wanted me out of his life. Well that night I made my decision and gave him what he wanted. When I left the next morning to go back to my moms house, that was the last time I've seen him. I blocked his phone number. Over the past 6 months he has been getting his son and daughter to call me and lea messages saying \"we miss you come back\" etc etc. he got my aunt to text me but I ignored her text. Not because I don't love her, but because replying to her would surely lead to having to see him again. Am I an asshole for cutting off a whole family? Should I have just stuck it out with my dad because he is the biological reason for me being alive?",

    "selftext": "I've been dating my girlfriend for 3.5 years now, we started dating in high school but are doing long distance in college.\n\nEver since the summer after we graduated from high school, our larger group of friends have taken an annual camping trip. I've attended every year, this will be our third trip. The first trip my girlfriend didn't go and experienced quite a bit of FOMO syndrome. The second year she ended up joining us but she doesn't like a couple of people and wasn't catered to as much as she'd like (she's a picky eater and there were no showers) so she had a pretty negative time. This year she decided not to go because she had a bad time last year.\n\nWe just got in an argument because she was under the impression I wasn't going again this year. She tells me that she feels as if I'm choosing our friends over her by going on this 3 day camping trip. I've already committed to going since she never told me that she didn't want me to. I'm feeling resentful that she's telling me this now when I still want to go have a good time with friends and would feel awkward backing out a day before the we leave to go camping.\n\nI'd be happy to provide more details or background info in the comments if you guys ask. I just am feeling very conflicted because she's been crying for half an hour now. I feel attacked but she's acting like the victim so I'm genuinely not sure who is the asshole. Help me out, tell me how to proceed?",

    "selftext": "Firstly, I know this might sound like a trivial matter but I feel that such a situation might reoccur in the future and I might as well heed some advice on whether what I did was okay or should I have done something different.\n\nSo backstory:\n\nMe and one of my group of friends are a bunch of 'young adults' ranging from 18 years of age to 25, me being 20. We became friends via being in the same classes in our local Polytechnic. \n\nThere is this guy whom I say call as 'Luke' who is the oldest among us. He have a rather poor habit of having poor time management and impatient too, meaning that he would frequently make us wait for him and would kick up a fuss if we don't while similarly kicking up a fuss if either one of us is late. Now I won't call this a big issue since I find the rest of my friends to have the same tendency too.\n\nAnother thing is that Luke also dislike us meeting other friends instead of 'our group'. I feel that this sometimes put me in a tight spot because I like to hang out with my other group of friends and partner from time to time. The rest are sometimes given remarks for meeting their other friends too and are annoyed. At this point I should make it clear that he is not shy of making other friends and in fact has other social circles too that we do not bash him for when he meets them.\n\nSo one day the last straw was had when another guy from the group (Let's call him 'Ben') decides to meet up with Luke for dinner. After waiting for 2 hours, Ben got fed up and left. This was the third time it happen and the group finally decided to ignore and separate away from him.\n\nAs for me, I never dealt with the lateness before (He is always on time when meeting me and if he did happen to be late, he would offer to drive me home.) and his little remarks about me meeting others did not bother me at all as I myself understand that it is sometimes disappointing to see your friends choosing to meet others instead of you. So I continued to chat with him and meet up for lunch or supper from time to time. \n\nNow the issue:\n\nBen's group now heard about it and seem to be upset about my 'betrayal' despite me still hanging out and eating with them the whole time. I told them that what Luke did wasn't an issue to me as he personally did not upset me in anyway and I do not want to break a friendship just because I had to choose a side. They seem to accept my stance on the matter but would keep on making remarks about me being friends with Luke.\n\nA month since it all started has passed and I am still spending my time with both sides, though I had decided to spend more time with a group of friends who share similar passions and my partner.\nBoth sides just feels so 'lame' with their constant badmouthing and remarks but I sometimes wonder if I was the asshole in choosing not to be sympathetic and not selecting a side to be with.\n\nSo tell me dear /u/, should I have picked a side? Was I doing the right thing by staying away from it? Or maybe I was an asshole for telling someone who is upset with the other that I shall still be friends with him because I do not face the same issues?\n\n(Sorry for the long post &gt;&lt;\")\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR; Friend perceived as an asshole is now 'kicked' from the group, I still stay friends with both side because it is not my issue and now the group keeps taunting me about it and treats me as a 'betrayer'.",

I didn't think my parents would take anything from there without asking first. \n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed I'm down about $50. I thought maybe I miscounted and never had that extra $50. A few more weeks and I noticed I'm down fucking $300. I ask my dad if he took any and he said he did. I asked how come he took it without asking, he said he'd pay me back and that I shouldn't complain because the money went to pay for food. He went on about how he never got to keep any of his own money because it all went to pay for food for his siblings, although, he had about 10 siblings and there's only the 3 of us. My mom also gets food stamps, and that's always been enough to get through the month.\n\nHe said since he owns the place, he can take my money since I don't pay rent and that I'm being ungrateful. He usually does pay me back when I lend them money, although that's not until months after. This was about 2 months ago, and I haven't been payed back anything.\n\nSo, AITA?",

    "selftext": "I am in the first year of University in the U.K, doing Computer Science, and one of my modules was a group project where we had to build a Twitter controlling website for a company using Ruby, SQLite html/css etc. (I think a module is what a US student would call a 'class')\n\nIn my group was one of my friends who I have virtually carried through the year in our other modules [~~helping him do~~] doing his coursework in Maths and Java meaning he was just about passing the year. In the group project it was very obvious who had done the work due to the nature of version control - it literally says who 'uploaded' the work to the online repository. \n\nThroughout and when the project was finished, unsurprisingly to me, he had not pulled his weight within the team, only having done the simplest of tasks from our storyboard. We each then had to hand in an anonymous peer assessment dividing 120 points between the other 5 members of our group. [The grade received being the mark we got from the lecturer for the website multiplied by our average percentage of the points from our peers.] I knew that if I gave him a bad score he would fail that module causing him to either fail the year if he was failing any of his other 7 modules (we only did the core 5 CS modules together which I knew he was passing the rest of because I did the work for him) meaning he would have to retake the year costing him \u00a314800 ($23110) extra on his student loan from Tuition fees and Maintenance loans or he would pass the year with a 'soft fail' which means he passed all of his other modules failing just the one. \n\nI gave him a bad score in the group project, which with a myopic view I will always think he deserved because he had not pulled his weight, so it caused him to fail the module. However, he then proceeded to fail the year because he failed a second module that we do not take together, as I suspected he might. Which means that he has to take first year again costing, as I previously said, around \u00a314800 ($23110). When asked by him what score I gave people in the module I told him that I gave everyone roughly equal so as not to cause an argument.  \n\nTl;dr I failed my friend in a group module in our First year of University, he failed a second module meaning he had to retake the year which is an expensive mistake.\n\nSo, am the asshole for failing my friend as I knew that him failing the year was a possibility, like some of my friends who i have confided in have said, or did he deserve the mark due to the fail being his own doing as he didn't put in the work as some of my other confidents have reassured me?\n\nHe is actually an ex-friend now as he is an awful person to be around and just leeches off everyone around him, but he was a close friend at the time. A 'toxic friend'.\n\nSorry for any error grammatical errors, writing isn't a strong area of mine!\n\n ",

She had recently been laid off (trip was booked before) so my GF and I had agreed to cover some costs for her while she was here. We picked up meals, transportation costs, tickets to whatever we were doing...etc....\n\nWe also let her crash at my place, which meant no alone time with the GF. \n\nI live in a big city and sold my car a couple months ago. This friend knew it was going to be mostly public transit and walking during our adventures, yet she complained every time.

Not so much about whether she is a thief, or what word to use to describe her or the actions ( not \"stealing\" because I handed her the money). Also, there was never a face to face confrontation with the friend. I pointed it out to the GF later and it started the fight. \nI honestly didn't know so much importance was put on the definition of the word stealing, or thief. Let me phrase it like this......\n\nIs it a dick move to accept the money??\n\n**Edit 2** : Thank you everyone for your opinions and participating in the conversation. \n\n**TL;DR**\nGF's friend had free Lyft rides.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I realize that by posting this, I'm probably an asshole. But I want to know if in this string of texts I am THE asshole. I'm changing names and taking out identifying info. I've kept everything else exactly as is. I just think this person is being ridiculous. This is a long thread, so grab some popcorn and have fun judging (if it's important, the city is NYC):\n\nMONDAY \n\nSam: Here's a new one: homeless guy at Frozen Yogurt Place pulling the handles and eating the froyo out of his hand\n\nTaylor: It's sort of brilliant. What flavor was he getting?\n\nSam: Birthday cake of course. I was disgusted.\n\nTaylor: There is a homeless man who always hangs out outside of my bagel shop. He just stands there looking completely catatonic and I want to buy him a bagel every day but I'm scared of him. Like I don't want him to follow me. But I also think it would probably do him wonders to know someone cares about him. \n\nSam: I'm so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. Just too many around the city\n\nTaylor: Most of them are very sick\n\nSam: Yes, that's true and a problem. I just can't stand the one per day at least on my train asking for money. \n\nSam: [sends picture of man sleeping in breezeway of bank where ATMs are] This was last week: someone sleeping inside the bank across the street. \n\nTaylor: I'd rather not have homeless people all about. It makes me feel unsafe, because I know they are likely mentally ill, but also very desperate. But I think as human beings, we're called to have a little compassion.\n\nSam: Have you ever run into a hostile one on the train? Not pleasant\n\nTaylor: I know it's not. I don't want to deal with it any more than you do. But I don't know, to hear that you feel no sympathy and that you're disgusted makes me sad.\n\nSam: Not true of the mentally ill ones. That's a sickness. But a large portion seem to be just fine asking for money on the same train multiple times a week with the same sob story. \n\nSam: Anyway, do you like Indian food?\n\nTaylor: I've never really had Indian food\n\nSam: Neither have I but I'm curious\n\nSam: Would you want to try it sometime? It's got to be vegetarian-friendly\n\nTaylor: I would try it...if you'll try volunteering at the homeless shelter with me some weekend\n\nSam: I'm not opposed to it. How are they related though?\n\nTaylor: Because how the poor are treated is important to me. We both want the same thing...less people on the streets, less begging...so why not be proactive about it? Do something good to help people? \n\nSam: I feel the poor &amp; working are much different than the poor and refusing to work. And again, mentally ill notwithstanding. \n\nTaylor: I agree, but it's a pretty strong statement to say you have zero sympathy and all disgust you. I sincerely doubt that guy sleeping in a bank is just refusing to work. I also think just think a lot of the time people have issues that we don't understand. Anyway, all I'm saying is I have felt strongly compelled to help the poor lately. I actually was planning on calling the shelter to set up a time to volunteer anyway this week. So let's do something nice for others bc both of us are pretty fortunate\n\nSam: Part of me does want to always help those who are less fortunate. But another part says, \"get a job.\" That's the no sympathy part. If millions of immigrants can come here illegally and work hard selling fruit along the highway, so can the dummy on the train \n\nTaylor: We just don't know the circumstances of these people. Plenty of people abuse the system. And that, in my opinion, is gross. But there are plenty of people who seem fine who truly can't get a job [redacted because of a personal story]. I'm not saying every person is a sob story, nd there are definitely gross, horrible people out there, but defaulting to place of no compassion isn't a good look for anyone. \n\nSam: I was very clear that any mental disability is notwithstanding. You're giving a free pass to too many who just refuse to work. Ride the train with me sometime and we'll count how many are qualified to sell fruit on the highway. It'll be 9 out of 10. \n\nTaylor: I'm not giving a free pass to anyone. I am saying that it's our job to be compassionate human beings and do what we can take make sure our fellow humans are treated with dignity. I'm not saying handouts, I'm just advocating for not judging and not looking at people we don't know with disgust because we don't know their story. That's all. \n\nSam: Well I bet your compassion level would be muuuuch different if you rode 4 trains a day in the city, or lived on the street that the guy pissed in the middle of on the front of the Post yesterday, or needed to use that ATM in the picture I sent. Much different when it's in your face every day. \n\nTaylor: Do you think those people are mentally sound? I would guess those people need a lot of help. \n\nSam: There are definitely two different categories. I just have no sympathy for the large group that refuses to help themselves. And they are everywhere. \n\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nSam: Saw the BAND NAME at Venue last night with _______. Only other time I've seen them was with you at Another Venue. \n\nTaylor: Nice\n\nSam: Off to Italy right now. See you in a couple of weeks?\n\nTaylor: Have fun\n\nSam: Those aren't your normal enthusiastic texts. Why?\n\nTaylor: You wouldn't be asking the question if you didn't have some idea why. Honestly, those things you said really bothered me. I'm sure I'll be over it by the time you get back. I'm just not over it right now. \n\nSam: It's a difference of opinion on a social issue. You've never had that happen before? I've got good friends who think Obama is the equivalent to Satan and born in Kenya. \n\nTaylor: I don't think it's a social issue. I think it's a deeply rooted value. We could disagree all day long on abortion, politics, criminalizing drug use...whatever. But a lack of empathy for fellow humans is way deeper than any of that. And I'm trying not to be brash, I think your Italy trip is well-timed and I can cool off before saying anything stupid\n\nSam: So you think I have no empathy for fellow humans? That's beyond stupid. Where are you getting that from?\n\nTaylor: \"I'm so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever.\"\n\nSam: So you take one half-serious text and accuse me of having no empathy for fellow humans? I then explained my ACTUAL opinions quite thoroughly. You either misread that or need to get off your pedestal. We have the EXACT same level of caring for others. \n\nTaylor: I'm not on any pedestal. But your comments hurled you off the one I had you on. I don't want to fight, I just need time to cool off because if you were joking it was still extremely offensive\n\nSam: So what's more offensive? A simple joke or accusing a friend of lack of character? You tell me. \n\nTaylor: This is why I didn't want to talk about this now \n\nSam: Why not? It's how you feel. And when I said I wasn't opposed to joining you at the shelter (actually like the idea), did you just choose to ignore that part when you were passing judgement on my character? \n\nTaylor: Because I wanted time to cool off. \n\nSam: Haha, cool off from what? We were discussing a social issue like adults do and you turned it into a moral issue. So what's next? I'm pro choice, so I have no empathy for babies? \n\nTaylor: This is why I wanted to take a step back, so I could better discern emotion and logic. Do you REALLY want to have this out right now?\n\nSam: I've already stated my case several times. I'm good as long as you realize how offensive that is to judge someone's entire character like that. Luckily, I have very thick skin.\n\nTaylor: Do you realize it's offensive to call people disgusting without understanding their life situation and where they came from?\n\nSam: What part of \"joke\" did you not get? I've stated my true opinions. If I had known that you couldn't take a joke and were the moral defender of all less fortunate, I wouldn't have joked. You have to admit, to say I have no empathy for fellow humans is a ridiculous statement. \n\nTaylor: Ok. It was a joke. I'll accept it. Have a good trip.\n\n\n",

At this point I begin getting concerned. As the dog gets closer he does not slow and jumps on my dog. My dog in response begins stumbling away down the nearest driveway, obviously hurt, and yet the doberman continues his assault. Eventually the lady who owned the doberman strolled into the scene. As she opens her mouth I expect some sort of apology but all she says is \"You should probably get a leash for your dog\", in an extremely bitchy tone.\nAt the time I was appalled because neither dog was on leash. It seemed completely her fault. So I just kind of left with out saying anything.\n\nHowever I looked back on the situation a few days later and realized it all could have been avoided if I had my dog on a leash. Also the lady did have a leash with her, and my dog did bark at the other dog when he began barking at her. I really don't know who's to blame, so reddit AITA?\n\n \n\n\n",

There was only one person working the counter when we got there, but no line so we decided to have a couple of samples. While we were, the line grew and my anxiety at holding up the line with it. So we order our ice creams and pay, the total was less than four dollars and I paid with a 20 and received 3 fives. The guy at the counter immediately started helping the next customer so I didn't have the chance to ask him to make change. My coworker didn't have change either but I'm insane about tipping so I couldn't really let that lie. I saw there were a couple of ones in the jar already so figured, hey, $3 is a generous tip, but it makes me feel better than no dollars, so I threw a five in and grabbed the two ones and walked out of the Cold Stone area.\n\nWhat\u2019s this? A wild do-gooder eating at a different place across the food court appears! \u201cExcuse me; you wanna put that money you took back in the jar?\u201d I tried to explain to him that I made change because the guy was busy but he wouldn\u2019t listen and over and over kept telling me to put the money back. I tried to show him the contents of my purse and I asked him if he wanted to go talk to the Cold Stone guy with me and he said no, just for me to put the \u201cwad\u201d of cash back. Looking back I should have just walked away, but I was pretty mad. I walked back in to the Cold Stone area just so that the Cold Stone guy would know that I did in fact tip him and he looked in the tip jar and said he trusted me and I walked back out. As I walked out it was to people congratulating this Good Samaritan and I kid you not, light applause.\n\nNow I can appreciate what it may have looked like I was doing, but it really bothers me that he would accuse me and then do no further investigation even though I was ready and willing to provide him with evidence and that he gets to go home thinking that he won the day for the good and the righteous and I get to go home hoping that he got into a terrible accident that left him disfigured, but alive (though what kind of quality of life he can expect I\u2019m not willing to speculate).\n\nSo, in all my efforts to not be an asshole, was I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR** Got accused of stealing, tried to explain myself, left in shame to the applause of onlookers\n",

To set the stage this bar is very small, there's a bar down the one side (like the physical bar with the Taps and bar stools), a small one person wide lane to walk through, and two person tables along the wall. Pretty tight space, and so seating is at a premium. \n\nTowards the end of the night we were ready to go and my girlfriend went to the washroom while I got up to pay the bill. We both left our coats on the backs of our chairs, and our empty glasses were on the table. \n\nI come back from paying the tab and my chair is gone and my coat has been thrown (or placed nicely, I don't know I wasn't there) onto the table. The table behind us now has a third chair, with a new person sitting in it. Presumably the friend of the people already sitting there. \n\nNow, we were leaving at this point anyways but I was annoyed that my coat had been moved and the chair had been taken, because it could have been just as likely that I had gone to get another drink instead of paying to leave. (bar service only) so I got the guys attention and told him that I happened to be leaving but in the future he probably shouldn't take chairs that have coats on them because they're clearly taken. He tried to give the chair back, and I told him not to worry about it because I didn't need it anymore I was leaving, just that he probably shouldn't take chairs from tables that are clearly in use. He then told me that if I didn't want the chair back that I should have just left him alone, and that I was being an asshole. \n\nI didn't want to start a confrontation so I just told him to be sure next time, at which point he flipped me off so I blew him a kiss. At that point I left with my girlfriend and he yelled at her that her boyfriend was an asshole. \n\nMaybe I didn't need to say anything, but I still think he needed to know it's not cool to just move the belongings of strangers to get a chair. Maybe I'm the asshole?",

The highway goes down to 1 lane oftentimes, and passing lanes open up every few km. \n\nAs I'm cruising along, a lady in a subcompact Kia comes ripping up as the lane is closing into one. I'm still on the left side and the lane ending sign passed a couple hundred metres ago, and she is edging up on the shoulder as if to overtake me on the right. \n\nKnowing this would be stupid as fuck on her part and dangerous, as we're in one lane and she's coming up beside me, I centre my car in the lane so she doesn't attempt to pass me on either side, as passing is illegal here. \n\nNow I'm in a German sports car, it goes pretty quick, but naturally this is the highway and I'm in no hurry. She tails me pretty close until the next passing lane, I keep speeding up so we're going faster, but there are slow-moving semis and vans in the slow lane that I want to pass before moving over for her. \n\nEventually when I pass all the slow moving vehicles, I slow down and signal my intention to move into the right lane. This puts her within maybe 4 ft of my car, but being safe is priority number 1 right now. As I go to follow through with the lane change and make my final shoulder check, she swings out into the right lane and is guns it to 150, passing illegally. I react quickly and move to the left of my lane, but holy shit, if I hadn't done two shoulder checks that would be a collision at more than 100mph. I had my signal on for more than a couple seconds, she had to have known my intention was to get out of her damn way. \n\nI slam on my horn and she flips me off, takes the next exit.

Us 4 guys had a lot of built up anger about things that have very little to do with this post, so I'll skip most of it. Due to our anger and lack of communication with all of us, we organized a meeting a couple of weeks ago to talk out our issues with each other. \n\nAt this \"meeting\" I told my friend that it's annoying that I can't talk to him when he is constantly texting his girlfriend, because it's in one ear and out the other. Every single time I am with him he is texting his girlfriend, and whatever she has to say is always more important that the people he is with. She's a junior in high school and to me, is very clingy. I wish I could communicate just HOW OFTEN HE TEXTS HER, even when he is with me and the rest of our group. Anyways, at this meeting he agreed with me and promised to stop and that he would live in the moment with his friends, and not constantly be texting her.\n\nI guess that went in one ear and out the other because last night we went to see the movie Southpaw (one of the best movies I've ever seen, might I add) and he was texting her the whole fucking time! Every 5 seconds I would see his screen light up, and he would tap away texting her back. I called him out on it after the movie and he claimed that he only did it during the boring parts. I was especially bothered because I paid for his movie ticket. I always buy for him because he can't afford the things we do, and I can. His constant texting of her, even after we have spoken about it, annoys the shit out of me.\n\nSo today he texted me asking if I wanted to go to dinner tonight. I told him sure. Five minutes later he texted back saying that his girlfriend's parents thought he was going with them tonight, so he told me that he couldn't have dinner tonight, and tried to make it funny. I replied with a \"Fuck you\" and \"You're a dick.\" and he replied with two texts, one saying \"Okay\" and the other saying \"My bad, I'm sorry I thought I wasn't going to.\" Perhaps I was being too hard but it might be part of this built up anger that his girlfriend takes priority over everything that is happening at a given time. Asked him after the movie what he was doing this weekend, he's going to hang out with his girlfriend every night this weekend. It's annoying the shit out of me. He always says \"If it's a real relationship, then it will last.\" And every time I want to reply \"If it's a real relationship, she'll understand when you're hanging out with your friends and neither of you will text each other.\"\n\nAnyways Reddit, Am I the Asshole?",

In 2013, the burglary rate was 0.85%. \n* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/MuoD9Mp.png) is the historical burglary rates compared to the US Average for our city.\n* We live on the **3rd** floor of an apartment building that has three apartments per floor. (Passers by are much less likely to climb several flights of stairs to burglarize us.)\n* We know all of the neighbors on our floor.\n* Our apartment has a gate that has a lock on it, but the lock on the gate is currently disabled so the mailman can deliver mail. (But to a passerby, they can't really tell if it is locked or unlocked.\n* We have a security camera that faces the front door from inside the apartment that records upon motion detection and stores the video offsite. (To the apartment next door.)\n* We have an alarm system that detects when the door is opened and sounds an alarm and notifies the apartment occupants' mobile devices when the door has been opened. The alarm has to be armed for it to do this.\n* My roommate has a computer setup which I'll generously estimate the value at $2000 and a bike which I'll also generously value at $500.\n* I've offered to reimburse him for the value of anything that would get stolen if we were to get robbed. (I'm confident this would never happen.)\n\n**My philosophy on locking the door**\n\nAppropriate times to lock the door:\n\n* No one is in the apartment *and* we are not next door in the neighbors apartment. (Note: our neighbors apartment door is literally 1 step from our front door.)\n* Everyone in the apartment is sleeping.\n\n**My roommates philosophy on locking the door**\n\nAppropriate times to lock the door:\n\n* If you're going to leave the apartment for more than two minutes, even just to go next door to our neighbor's apartment, lock the door.\n\n* Everyone in the apartment is sleeping.\n\nI do not want to have to lock the door every time I need to go borrow a cup of sugar from our neighbors. It is excessive and annoying.\n\nMy roommate says this about why he wants to lock the door so much:\n&gt;The time and effort it takes me to lock the door is much less costly in terms of time and money if we were to get robbed.\n\n&gt;The security system doesn't matter, because someone could still walk in and damage something.\n\n**People shouldn't let fear dictate their habits to this degree.**\n\nAm I justified in being annoyed and is my door locking schema appropriate?\n",

Except to the extent written permission is given, pets may not be brought upon the Premises, whether such pets belong to Resident(s) or to any other person. **The presence of any pets as to which written permission has not been given and is not currently in force, even if such pets are \"just visiting\", shall be deemed a material and incurable breach of this Lease and shall be cause for the service of a three-day notice terminating the tenancy.** This policy does not apply to service animals.\"\n\n\"**Visitors**\n\nTenant acknowledges that his guests are his responsibility that they will park in only designated parking areas and that they will adhere to all the apartment rules. Visitors are limited to a 5 days day stay. Visitors staying longer than 5 days days must notify Management in writing.\"\n\nCheckmate.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 3, 7/30/15 4:00pm\n\nRoommate obviously noticed the signs of me packing up and asked if I was moving out. I said I had nothing to say to him. I plan on talking to the leasing people tomorrow. He came back an hour later and said, \"Just so you know, if you don't pay August rent I will sue you in Small Claims Court.\"\n\nI told him to have a nice day.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 4, 7/30/15 11:48pm\n\nI have completely moved out. The leasing people, who I talked with for an hour, were *exceedingly* unhelpful. If I ever want to be able to legally move out of there I have to have him co-sign a \"roommate separation agreement\" and he. will. not. sign. it.\n\nThey tell me that I wouldn't even be able to be eligible to get my deposit back until both of us move out. I asked what that meant if he stayed there for 5 years and the woman shrugged at me. They say also that anything that is problematic with the apartment while she's there is my responsibility too because my name is on the lease. \"You're telling me that my roommate brings an uninvited guest and her dog against my wishes, I report it, and I'll get in trouble for having an unauthorized pet?\"\n\n\"Your name is on the lease.\" the woman said and stared blankly.\n\nLater, in an unfortunate fit of rage while loading/packing, her stupid dog walked past me in the hallway while the front door was open because I was carrying things. I yelled, \"GET OUT!\" at it. \n\nLooking worried it ran outside and she chased it. I closed the door and locked it. Not like she has a key. Anyway he threatened to call the cops. I told him go ahead, but he backed down. After talking with my parents they suggested, \"Oh why don't you talk to dear family friend, the attorney who specializes in real estate whose husband is a realtor and they are our neighbors and you practically were an older brother to their daughter?\"\n\n*facepalm because I completely forgot about that wonderful woman* \"Yes, please, dad. Would you please call her and ask if it's ok for me to get her advice?\"\n\nHe sent off a voicemail and an email. Hopefully I will get in touch tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed.\n\n----\n\n**FINAL UPDATE** 8/3/15  6:53pm PST\n\nOn Friday I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the leasing office and CCed the roommate stating I had moved out, new person had moved in with dog, I wish to give notice, he wont let me off lease, etc. I also stated I would be pursuing small claims court action. I did.  Then I went to the local small claims court and submitted California SC-100 form for 3 months rent, my deposit, and an extra $1000 for potential pet damages against the roommate. 3 months is because court dates can take a while and if I wasn't allowed off the lease I would have to be compensated. I had no expectation of getting this money; what I wanted was to be able to walk away free and clear. That was the alternative I planned to present to him.\n\nI received a text on Friday evening from the roommate that I had been released from the lease. I know he had not received the paperwork yet, so this was likely a response to the text I sent him that said, \"hey I need you to pay me $4200\" as required by law (I have to ask for it before taking legal action). The leasing company made it clear I still had to give 30 days notice so today being the 3rd I had to visit the office and pay my half of the $1875 rent so I could walk away. I was prepared for that outcome.\n\nI asked for my copy of the release form he signed and then inquired about the rent I had to pay. Apparently he added his girlfriend and her dog to the lease. She is on the lease. Their names are on the lease. \"Wait,\" I said, \"does this mean I don't have to pay for August?\"\n\nIn true bureaucratic form they answered, \"Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\nI blinked and stared. \"I'm... free?\"\n\n\"Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\n\"Can I get that in writing?\" I inquired, starting to feel a twinge of hope.\n\n\"That's what this release form is. It was signed on the 31st. You claim to have moved out. Your name is not on the lease.\"\n\n\"Would you like my keys?\" I asked\n\n\"We can take them or you can give them to your old roommate.\"\n\n\"Thanks I'd like to never see him again. Here is the door key and here is the postal box key. You have been wonderful. Goodbye\"\n\nThen I left. I am now on my 3rd beer and happy as a clam. I will call off the lawsuit ASAP. They are paying the full rent for August and the foreseeable future. All is right with the world.",

    "selftext": "This is basically what happened. \nThe General Manager and I struck a deal for me to stay working at Popeyes as a cook. I was going to quit, but we are so understaffed that the GM wanted me to stay, until a replacement was found. The deal (which was made by the GM), was that I would need to stay working there, until a replacement was found, and in return, I would get a third day off and a raise of 35 cents. For four weeks straight I got the third day off, but not the fifth/last week I'd work there. That fifth week was a day that we would have an inspection done by the owner of the restaurant and a couple other people. Without telling me that I would need to work an extra day that week, the GM puts me to work for five days. This wouldn't have been a problem, if it was the first time this happened. When I saw the schedule on Monday, it was still being reworked, but I did see my name and the times I would work. I thought that he was working on it, so I didn't really think much of it. The next day I worked, I noticed that he hadn't changed a single thing from what I had seen the day before. I thought that it was odd, that he would do this, since it was a deal that he made the conditions for. The whole time I worked that day, I couldn't stop thinking about the reason he could have gone back on the deal, without telling me. I assumed it was because of the Inspection we were having. This eased my mind until I remembered that I had done a deal with him before, that he went back on, after the fourth week. This knowledge made me think hard of the last time. I started to think of the pattern that these two shared. Four weeks of him going through with the deal, not getting it the fifth week, getting it again on the sixth week, and then never getting it again after that. This realization made me believe that it was going to happen again. I didn't want it to, so after a day of talking about it with my family, I decided that I would quit at the end of the week. The next time I worked, I told every co-worker that I was going to leave at the end of the week and why I was doing it. (I wanted to have a nice goodbye between me and the other workers that I enjoyed working with.) I also asked them to do me the favor of not telling the GM I was leaving till my last day. I did this since I didn't believe that the GM deserved a heads up about me quitting, since he went back on the deal. I did this until my last day. On the morning of my last day, I came to work with a type of cake that I would bring whenever it was someone's last day of work. When he saw this cake, he knew something was up. He asks me about the cake, and I respond by saying that it was my last day. He gets surprised and wants to know why. I explain my reasonings and end it with saying that I didn't want to work for someone who would keep going back on deals after the fourth week. He protested by saying that he thought that I would understand. I did understand, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. \n\n\nThis small section is about me actually being an asshole. Throughout my last day working there, any time the GM would mention him being able to make deals with people and being able to follow through, I would go very out of my way to mention that he could not follow through after the fourth week. It didn't matter if he was talking with an employee, customer, or one of his friends, I would mention this.\n\n\ntl:dr   GM makes a deal with me so I don't quit, then goes back on said deal one month later. \n\n\nEdit: I just realized how much I typed.",

Well this week I invited this girl who I have known for 3 years but she has suddenly taken an interest in me now, we speak for like 3-6 hours a day which is more she talks to her boyfriend which I actually push her to do. I invited her at to come over at 9:30, knowing everyone else would be late and come like an hour later but I did not think or want to do anything sexual with this girl. Well we were talking about it and as a joke I said, 'what would your boyfriend say if I slipped my tongue in you LOL' she took it seriously and said sexually , 'I would tell him nothing happened'. Then I was confused and did not know whether she should still come that early. She proceeded to say that we cant do nothing major like blowies or anything. (At this point I was hiding how my emotions were exploding within me) I felt said we would feel guilty but she said again ' nothing is going to happen though ;)'. So now I have planned to help her cheat however her boyfriend has cheated on many girls and has cheated on her too. But hes an alright guy. Mine and her relationship has always been slightly sexual anyway so I am an ass if I proceeded with this. ( I probably am but how much of an ass ) \n\nTL;DR : me and a girl who has a boyfriend which cheated on her , me and her planned to make out sexually.\n\nUpdate: I called off the whole thing and told the girl that we should have sex or anything until shes done with her relationship and even then its only a friends with benefits type thing.\n\nUpdate 2: Told her that she 'Should not cheat on a douche just break up with the douche' before we do anything and plus I do not know if I could trust her listening to you guys. Never can be with a cheater because it will leave a not trusting scar on the relationship. \n\nUpdate 3: Never say 'Blowies' ever again.\n\nUpdate 4 : RSK!",

John and my boyfriend work away from home frequently, so it was mostly me and Anna. The house belongs to my boyfriend and we all paid the same rent.\n\nAnna was not cut out for roommates. She left huge messes all over the house (dirty sports equipment, clothing) and would render shared spaces unusable for hours (using the living room to Skype her family, taking 2 hours in the bathroom when everybody else was getting ready for work). She also had it out for me. If I so much as left a dish in the sink, she would call my boyfriend to tattle on me. She would get mad at me for not washing the dishes she used to cook herself a 4-course meal and thought I wasn't \"doing my share\". I cooked my own food and washed my own dishes...\n\nEventually, I told Anna to chill out and stop complaining. She was the only person who ever complained, out of four people sharing the house. She did not take kindly to this and decided that she and John were moving out ASAP.\n\nShe and John moved out while my boyfriend and I were on vacation. I cleaned the entire house before we left, and when I got back the house was a disaster. There was garbage all over the floor, molasses spills on the hardwood and they had taken all of our toilet paper, so I couldn't even pee at home after a 15 hour plane ride at 1am. They had also left dirty dishes PILED in the sink and the garbage can overflowing onto the floor.\n\nMy boyfriend was off at work and didn't have to clean the mess (I did). He also decided that John could continue to use our garage and shed as a storage space (even though they don't pay rent and have their own garage, but that's none of my business). John and Anna kept one of our house keys so they could access the house where the garage key is kept.\n\nAnna is over at the house at *least* every two weeks, and she only comes when the house is empty. The first time, she let my puppy escape the house. He was 12 weeks old and 1.5lbs. The second time, beer cans spilled from her trunk and she left them there in the yard. Then yesterday, she gave the house key to her brother and told him to pick up her golf equipment. I got home and the driveway was blocked by him, so I had to park on a different street than where I live. \n\nI asked my boyfriend to either take the key back, or tell Anna that she can only come over when I am home. I said I knew it was his house, but I lived there too and I felt uncomfortable with Anna having unlimited access to my possessions and pet because she had proved that she doesn't respect the space. She was also handing the keys around to other people and every time she came, she caused a huge inconvenience (cleaning up after her, not having a place to park, MY DOG ALMOST GETTING AWAY).\n\nBoy, did that go over poorly. My boyfriend told me \"It's his house and he trusts his friends\". I said he shouldn't, because she almost got our dog killed and I have to clean up every time she comes over. He said \"This is how it is, I'm not changing anything just because you complain. My house, my rules. Get over it. I'm not going to tell my best friend that I don't trust him\".\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting disrespectful people coming in and out of where I live willy-nilly? I just want them to be more considerate if they're going to use all the available storage space for free...",

I was worried something happened between him and his mom (she can be difficult to deal with at times), or something had happened to his 91 year old grandfather, or something happened to the new car. There were so many different things it could be and I was worried about it. He tells me to forget it. I tell hi. He can't just tell me we need to talk and the refuse to talk.

I told him I would be panicked all day if he didn't let me know what was happening.\n\nHe gets really angry at me. He tells me he got his blood work back and has to go on Lipitor.

I realized \"her\" pictures were grainy, oddly cropped, eyes always blacked out *(Which \"she\" said was because of privacy reasons).* Then we started getting more personal, and started sexting. And the eyes stopped being blacked out. And the pictures had less and less clothing in them.\n\nYesterday, just browsing the internet, I happened upon a picture which looked familiar.

It was the exact same picture, except the mirror in the background which included the original picture taker's face was cropped out.

I have always felt that she's kind of selfish for saving to buy the 'right' food instead of just buying a cheaper option and having more money for other things. ",

They were on good terms, or so I thought (Why would she be invited if she wasn't?). Anyway we all have a bit too much to drink and next thing I know I'm making out with this girl. Me and this girl were never super close, but we definitely had history. Mostly through the mutual friend hosting the party. Things got out of hand, one thing led to another, you get the picture. After the party she leaves the next day for some family vacation. \n\nNow, he wouldn't outright say he was mad. Initially when I told him he said it was \"fucking hilarious\" and that he actually wasn't mad. I believed him and agreed to chill with them the next day. I hang out with my friend and his new girlfriend, and they're both giving me a lot of shit for having sex with his Ex. Making jokes in really bad taste, asking really prodding details (He knows I don't like bragging about any sort of escapades). Not your typical \"How'd it go\" shit, but like really personal questions. Like to the point where they're actually making uncomfortable and having me look for an excuse to leave. \n\n I don't regret what I did, but I felt like I could've gotten the OK from him before all this happened. In that regard, I may be the asshole. But the way he acted towards me was inexcusable. Seriously unlike I've ever seen him in our six years of being best friends. It was backhanded, mean, and so unlike the guy I know. The only reason I could see him being so upset over this situation is if he wasn't over his Ex. Him and the new girlfriend of his have talked about moving in together, and his Ex was at the party by invitation. Was I the asshole for doing what I did based on the situational queues?",

    "selftext": "I'm going to try to summarize because it's a LOOOONG story.\n\nI lived in a different state with my husband and daughter and my own two cats. My Mom bought a house in this state a while back but moved out of it to live with her boyfriend- she offered to give me the house. \n\nThe deal as -I- remember it is that we were going to take care of her six cats until she bought a bigger house with her boyfriend. One of the cats was my late great grandma's cat. I agreed to these terms. Later on she said that her small annoying dog was included in this deal. I had no recollection of this being part of it but she insisted that it had always been the deal. (Later found out that when she changed it was the same time she got a new dog - which brought her to the two-pet cap at her boyfriends house (because she brought her other dog with her there))\n\nI reluctantly agreed- I was having a difficult time at the place I was staying (invited 'friend' to live in a spare room and she became hostile and refused to do anything to support herself or the household- different AITA I guess). Anyway I wanted ou bad because I didn't want to kick this chick and her baby out so I figured I would just leave. \n\nWe get out here and everything is worse than i remember her telling me (house is in worse shape, animals are VERY badly behaved etc) but we get to work. It ended up being four cats (not sure how my math got skewed but I'm telling it as I remember it) because she had already taken one to her place before we got there, plus the stupid dog. \n\nIn the first few months, one of the cats ran off through a hole I the house that we did not know existed. We still have not found the cat but we did cover up the hole. Gradually she begins taking animals- first one of the other cats, because it did nothing but howl and howl constantly because none of the damn cats were fixed. She paid to get that cat and one other cat fixed. The last cat (GGC) had already been fixed. My mom and I converse occasionally about the possibility of me keeping the last two cats. She got her new place and after like two months she finally took the dog after us Begging and begging because this dog was a pain in the ass and peed and pooped all over and whined constantly really loudly. I fully agree to take one of the cats but leave GGC up in the air. \n\nIn between this stuff we rescue a dog and two kittens off the street. We wanted to keep them but ended up finding them good homes instead because it was too much for us to handle. \n\nI continue to ask when mom plans to take GGC, and she keeps putting it off, and I say that she needs to go to the vet. An appointment is not made until I casually suggest calling HER mom about it instead (who was supposed to pay for the vet bills if my mom took the cat in). Cheap shot, but this cat needed treatment and I absolutely could not do it myself. \n\nAt the appointment it is discovered that this cat had FIV which is not transmittable to humans but is to other cats and she must be keep away from other cats. At this point we have our two original cats and the one of my mother's that we are keeping. My mother has three dogs and three cats (one newish kitten that SHE rescued and decided to keep) along with a bunch of rodents. It is already well known that my mom is an animal hoarder. \n\nWe discuss who takes the cat and it gets a bit heated. We have a three bedroom house (the one she gave of, free of charge) and a toddler and a baby now on the way. She has a two bedroom house, a barn, a lot of land, and it's just her and her husband. This cat should not be kept around other cats. My mom says she has far too many animals to be able to take her and nowhere to keep her. Currently this cat is in our third room, which we would love to be able to use since we will be needing the extra space. My mom then bought a kitten from petsmart, at which point I flipped out, we had a huge fight, and I asked her why EXACTLY she felt she could get another kitten but not take this cat if she did indeed think she had too many animals. She flat out told me she couldn't answer that. She also says she never remembers saying she would take ANY of the cats back, and she also remembers the dog being part of the original deal- all of which conflicts with what I thought was the original deal.\n\nI caved and said fuck it, I'll take the cat but you still have to do all the vet stuff. We have not talked about it since, except for me jokingly saying we would trade GGC for the kitten, who LOVES my daughter.\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE???",

    "selftext": "First off, a little background: My mom has obvious signs of narcissistic personality disorder.  This is just a well-known fact in my family.  Pretty much everything is about her and her feelings and god forbid you do something to offend her sensibilities (One time she told me I didn't love her because I forgot to put the toilet lid down after peeing- not the seat, the actual lid).  Anyway it caused a lot of trouble for me emotionally while I was growing up, but I got over it and she's \"manageable\" now and we have a decent relationship.\n\nOn to my plants.  I don't have children or pets, and I don't have many hobbies.  My one thing, the one thing in the world I am good at and people come to me for advice on is growing succulents and air plants (for those who don't know what an air plant is, look them up, they're awesome).  These plants are my babies, I had them on my desk and in my garden while I pushed through an incredibly emotional period in my life (crap job, crap town).  While I can't say that they provided any emotional support, I can say that nurturing them and watching them respond to my care helped me feel an incredible sense of zen.  \n\nI finally got a job in a place I'd been interested in moving to, about five hours away.  I had to move an entire apartment on a budget, so I asked my mom (who lives about an hour from my old apartment) if she'd take care of them for me.  She said yes, which was much appreciated and is a huge favor.  It's really no small task, I had about six or seven succulents and about thirty air plants.  Still, I drove them up to her place and she found places in the garden for the succulents and places in the house for the air plants.\n\nShe by no means has a black thumb- she has many succulents herself and even has two air plants of her own she managed to keep alive for over a year now.  Still, she made me swear that I wouldn't be mad at her if some of my plants died.  I put aside five of the air plants and told her that these were my special plants and I would appreciate it if she could take extra special care of them.  I also told her about one of my succulents which is a rare crested variety and a prized possession.  She seemed to be paying attention.  I assured her there were NO SPECIAL WATERING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF MY PLANTS.  In fact, she even has written instructions on the best method for watering all air plants, put together by me.  It's super easy.  I told her to water my air plants when she did hers and same for the succulents.\n\nMost of my air plants are in handcrafted terrariums.  She was worried that she wouldn't be able to remember which plant went in which terrarium, so I just told her to take them all out and leave them on a towel by a window to get partial sun.  I told her I would put them all back when I had a chance to get them from her.\n\nApparently, that was too complicated for her, because a week later she tells me she's going to try to sell some, with my blessing.  I am uncomfortable, but tell her OK as long as it's not the five I've set aside.  Then I get another blow when she tells me she sold a piece for $10.  I told her that the materials alone costed closer to $40, but she said she just wanted to make space.  I know she's weird about clutter, so I let it slide.\n\nI didn't hear anything from her for about two months on this subject.  Then, last weekend, I asked for pictures of some of my plants because I missed them (and I knew they were getting a bit more sun, so I was excited to see how well they were growing!).  She doesn\u2019t send the pics for like three days.  When she does, I am extremely disappointed.  It is clear she has not watered a single plant in two months.  My rare crested succulent is fried to a crisp, which is incredibly heartbreaking (as it is kind of irreplaceable), and the other plants I\u2019ve nurtured for over two years are dead and dying.\n\nShe tells me she\u2019s going to water the air plants the next day.  I know for a fact that this is the first time she\u2019s watered them in two months, goaded by my request for photos (she even asked me if my requesting photos \u201cwas a test\u201d).  Of course, she reports back that a lot of them are dead.  Not only the ones that I was a little less attached to, but the five I selected because I had an emotional attachment to them.  One of those five is called tillandsia tectorum, and was easily a $30 specimen.\n\nNeedless to say I am beside myself right now.  I can\u2019t even bring myself to talk to her, and I usually talk to her every day.  It\u2019s not like she\u2019s busy, she doesn\u2019t have a job and me and my brother have been out of the house for years.  I honestly have no clue what she does on a daily basis.\n\nSo, what do you think, Reddit? AITA for asking such a big favor of her? Should I have expected it? AITA for being mad at her?  How can I talk about this with her?  No matter how I tell her I\u2019m upset, all she\u2019ll do is focus on the fact she was doing me a huge favor and how I should be grateful.  At this point in my life I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s her being narcissistic as usual, or me being selfish and rude. Am I?",

    "selftext": "I was eating lunch out in the park and having a quiet conversation on my phone.  A school bus pulled up and a group of very rowdy students and adults from a local recreation center got off and began to play in the field.  One of the teachers brought a student over to the picnic tables.  Instead of sitting the child at any of the 11 unoccupied picnic tables in the immediate area, she sat him at the one that I was using.  Keep in mind, I had been the only one there.  All of the other tables were available.\n\n\"I'd actually prefer to eat privately,\" I said to the teacher.\n\n\"No, you're fine,\" was her reply.  \n\nSince she obviously wasn't going to move the child to any of the vacant picnic tables, I packed up my lunch.  As I was going, I said to the teachers, \"There were all these open tables.  This is pretty rude.\"  \n\nTheir collective response was that this is a public park and I don't own the picnic tables.  I agreed with them, but I persisted that they chose to use the one table where someone was quietly minding his own business.  This is like going into a movie theater where only one person is sitting in the middle of the theater and deciding to take the seat smack dab next to them.  Or getting on a bus where there are loads of open seats but deciding to take the seat right next to someone.  They are crowding someone when there is an obvious alternative.\n\nBut besides being invasive to me, it's also questionable judgement to decide that the best place to seat a child is next to the random stranger at the park.  Good thing I'm not some sicko.  Also, I think if the situation had been reversed, if the kids had been at the table first and I had just wandered by and sat down with them, the teachers would obviously be perturbed.  \n\nSo what do you think?  The teachers all reacted as if I was being really unreasonable.  With eleven open tables and only one occupied, I think it's just plain rude to choose the one that's occupied.  Yes, it's a public park.  Yes, you have the right to seat the child at the table.  No, I don't own the table.  But all that being said, to choose my table seemed like an obviously rude thing to do.  You can have the right to do something and that thing can still be a rude thing to do.  \n\nWas I an asshole?  ",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nso my situation is a bit complicated. Basically, I'm living with a roommate for the next few months although I'd much rather live alone. If you don't want to know the details, just skip the next part:\n\n&gt; Six years ago, I moved into this flat with two roommates and back then, I loved it. We got to know each other quite well, and after a while one of my roomies became my girlfriend. The other roommate moved to a different city but also kept her old room, so she could come over from time to time to visit her old friends. Basically, it was just me and my gf most of the time and I got used to that. I didn't want to share my personal space with anyone else anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; But A few months ago, my gf confessed that she had an affair, I broke up and kicked her out. So then her room was empty and I couldn't afford the rent alone. Finding a new (cheap) place to live is a nightmare in my city. In a few months, I will probably start a new job that will require me to move anyway so I decided it was the best to get a (temporary) roommate.\n\nNow, when I was showing the flat to my future roommates, I made it pretty clear that personal space and general quietness are very important to me. My now-roomie said it's the same for him and he doesn't mind. I believed him, so he got the room.\n\nHe's a really nice guy and he is absolutely quiet, only invites his gf or 1-2 other friends over, doesn't have any big parties, doesn't listen to loud music, doesn't just burst into my room...\n\nBut he likes talking to me. He's from Spain and his German (we're in Germany) is not the best, so he obviously wants to speak German in order to improve. I think that's a really great thing but somehow... after a long day of work, I just want to enjoy my dinner quietly without having to talk to anyone. And I find it really hard to have a relaxed conversation when I can hardly understand him and he can hardly understand me.\n\nUsually when I start making dinner, he's coming over after a while, starts making small talk, sometimes preparing his own dinner and sitting down at the table with me.\n\nI think that this is pretty normal social behavior so I feel like an ass for trying to avoid him.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

    "selftext": "Let me preface this with a few things, I'm not certain on some aspects from the opposite side of the problem, as I was told some info i full confidence not to leak it. However the situation, however muted has been a powder keg of an issue that could blow up if somebody comes across just the wrong way. \n\nAnyway;\n\nThe first and largest issue starts off with my friends; a married couple, and a mutual friend of ours. We'll call the married couple X and Y, the mutual friend We'll call Z.\n\nAnyways, Z and I had gotten into this table to game that was relatively new, and found a local game store that was going to start running events for it, enter X and Y. Over the following year we all become rather great friends and a wonderful group to just chill with if not just to play a game. \n\nEventually it became open knowledge Z was in an 'Open' relationship with his SO, and that he was actively looking.\nX had confronted Z and asked him \"as a friend\" (note this for later) not to involve Y in his search. a reasonable request.\n\nFast forward to New Years. This is that part that I prefaced about where I don't know (or really want to know) the whole story. all I know is that Z overstepped his bounds, violating X's request. So much so that it caused significant issue between X and Y (They're stable, but I'm to believe they've not come to terms yet).\n\nthere was a period of time when they closed up shop for several months, and didn't invite or really speak to anybody while they sorted stuff out between themselves. I'm unsure how much they've confronted Z about it, but I don't know if they have due to the personal conflict. Perhaps they swept it under the rug to save face. either way, eventually things got back to 'normal'\n\nfast forward to a new expansion that had been out for the game we all played for a bit. X had more or less found a rather potent combo that would later become a strong competitive play. Z, who at this point became the organizer for tournaments and such for said game at the LGS (Local Game Store).\n\nSeeing the combo executed in full strength made Z upset, feeling that it was unbalanced and wanted to have input brought in from the game's higher-ups. Z had went to X, and asked him \"As a friend\" to not play that combo during the next tournament, as he cannot outright tell somebody not to play anything, unless rules say otherwise. This made X pretty upset, and ran it anyway. Lo and behold, Z has issue with it. but like my wonderful friends to, instead of talking it out, they continue to just walk away from the issue and let the pot boil.\n\nfast forward about 6-7 months or so, and we're doing the initial stuff for store championships at a different LGS. Z was getting flustered, as X happened to have a gameplay strategy that was able to overtake Z's. (Z isn't running this event, as a side note) Losing sucks, and people get hot headed and flustered, so this wasn't unusual. X however took it a little to personally, when Z was making statements on him building something to directly counter him. \n\nThis was the straw that broke the camel's back, however. Most of us (X, Y, Myself, and a separate other concerned friend who opted to play mediator for Z) decided we needed to organize an intervention for Z's attitude, as from one side of the argument, he was having an attitude problem with alot of us. (He had been having job issues, and other personal conflicts, and stress buildups.) We decided to get with Z first and get more info. It was miscommunicated on what X was going to do, but what winds up happening was X renounces his friendship with Z, in an attempt to just remove ill-will from X's life just by removing him as a friend. \n\nThat's pretty much the bulk of it, Eventually Y does the same, as she tries to talk with Z and he seems to not want to listen to anything. \n\nI'm still friends with both parties, and while X &amp; Y seem OK now, Z still has issues. He feels like he can't show up at the LGS sometimes in fear that X is there. (Which to me, is just fucking stupid. but that's just because i think the whole thing is stupid, minus the first issue which i believe is the core of the problem).\n\nI think it seems pretty clear who the asshole is. but i feel like I may still be missing several important details, and I can't ask Z about said details as I don't want to stir the shitstorm back up, and I'm on my word that I wouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n(Posting this from an alt, even so as not to be stumbled across.)\n\nI'm unsure how to proceed, but these issues have basically killed the playgroup, and the game for our LGS, and I can't seem to organize any decent hangout time, as X &amp; Y got out of the game, and are doing other things. Z still runs the game at said LGS, but I have to keep in a decent topic otherwise he'll get a near anxiety attack just thinking about the bullshit issues. Alot of this will probably read extremely trivial and one sided, and from an outside source, it basically is. there's some things I've left out as they're complicated to explain, and aren't exactly of importance\n\nI just wanna get my friends back to normal but I don't think it'll happen especially since none of them apparently know how to talk or listen to each other.\n\nWho's the asshole here? X/Y for not being forthcoming with their feelings? Z for completely burning X and Y's trust? Or perhaps I missed a cue in stopping the whole thing? I don't honestly fucking know.",

Protective enough that my aunt's husband will probably show up with a glock if I get in a fight and call him. That said, I stay at their house and I understand that they work and I have to respect their sleeping schedule. For that, I have made sure to be home before 11 everyday to not interrupt their sleep... Today was an exception because I bought a ticket to a DJ show at a pub and took my cousin and another girl there to have a good time... I told them beforehand that I will just go to my cousins house to not interrupt them at night. Lo and behold at 12:30 they text me saying that they are waiting for me at the door and I should come out cause they don't think being out after 1am IN A TOURIST HUB is safe... I almost had a meltdown and wanted to just yell at them asking what the hell was wrong with them but I was able to keep my cool and move on...\n\nI understand that they are doing that for my own safety and I appreciate it but cmon... I traveled alone for a reason...\n\nTomorrow, I'm going to tell them that I'm not going to stay at their house anymore and will move to my cousin's. I just think that I haven't spent 2k to come here and listen to their fucking orders. It's my fucking vacation and I want to do whatever I want...\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

While I was eating the chocolate bar my sister (18 yrs old) ran up and grabbed it. My parents are walking the dog. I reacted and tried to grab it first but the end result was the remaining chocolate either falling on the floor or in my sisters hand. I need all the food I can get.(5'11\" and 145 pounds)\n\n I joke around a lot and can take any joke but this wasn't a real joke so I get pissed off but don't yell or anything. I tell her she's a bitch. She starts yelling saying it was just a joke.( Her and my mom get in yelling fits daily) I can sort of understand that but I'm pissed that I lost the last half of of my candy bar. I tell her to grab me a knew one and we will be cool. She initially says yes but when I tell her that they where in the basement she yells its to much work and it was just a joke. I ask her a few more times but she repeats the same point.She's yelling BTW for no reason.\n\n So this is AITA begins. In my arrogant and condescending mood I start preaching and how its just mean  spirited. She's was writing thank you letters to some people because her birthday was recently and of course received gifts. So in my arrogant mood I grab a bottle of mustard left out and squirt it on a few notes left out. She yells at me more and says in a dick for doing it. She tells me to clean it up which I said I would if she got me my chocolate bar. She says no and that its different and I'm a dick. During the entire argument she yells but I just speak in a condescending dickish way. Any ways my parents get home and now I can't go to a party this weekend.",

We have told him to go away: Didn't work. We told him to fuck off: Didn't work. We've sat him down and had an actual conversation and asked him to go hang about with people that are actually his friends (Which he has) and his reply is usually something along the lines of \"It's a free country\" and thats his justification for following us around. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but as I said, he was a dick to everyone, so another reason I want him to leave us alone is the fact that people might think we are dicks for being \"Friends\" with him. It honestly ruins my school day some days just knowing that he's there, I listened to a recent JRE episode and he was talking about not letting people in his life that wont make it better and I agree with that as a rule of life.

Fast forward to last week  my cousins (one is 5 and the other is 10) went away to my grandmas house for the weekend as they usually do a few times a month. And it was just me and my auntie, I helped her all day doing yard work etc. I ended up staying for dinner (side note: she makes an amazing lasagne anyways....) She had a glass of wine and offered me a beer I thought about it for a while and i said i cant because im driving, she said just have a few and stay in the spare room. We started watching a movie of her choice (The notebook, I secretly love it but i tried putting up a fight to make it seem i don't like it) the movie starts and she gets me another beer and herself another glass of wine, she also grabs a blanket and got changed into something more comfortable. I sit on her massive sofa one arm on the back of the chair and the other on the other side, she comes and cuddles next to me and wraps the blanket around both of us(side note: this isn't an odd thing we usually had a movie night but this time the kids weren't with us). The movie continues and she slides further down the sofa and puts her head on my lap, my arm instinctively goes to her hips and i start to massage her thigh,she turns onto her back, so my hand goes straight to her upper thigh. And one thing leads to another and we end up fucking in her bed all the while she is telling me that she hasn't had sex in years. We fall asleep in each others arms.

I have been living peacefully on the first floor for about two months until recently a single mother with three bad ass kids around the ages of six moved into the apartment directly above me. For approximately a week, the kids sound like they are intentionally trying to annoy the hell out of me by stomping around like apes. If you have ever had someone live above you, multiply the noise by ten and now you feel my pain.

Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours.

Now my girlfriend and I argue quite a lot and a few months back during an argument she made a personal attack on me and I in turn made a personal attack on her. My girlfriend then turned around and slapped me twice; saying her actions were justified because of what I said. I did not slap her back and simply told her to get out of my room. \n\nNow recently we had another argument which was much worse and in this argument I realised where this was going and repeatedly told my girlfriend to leave my room so we could cool down. She refused. \n\nEvery single time I tried to make her leave she would scream 'Don't touch me!' Don't touch me!!' \n\nSo I went into my bed, under the covers and stopped replying to her in an attempt to cool down, she did not like the fact that I wasn't arguing back with her and thus she in turn poured bottle of water all over my bed covers so that the water seeped through. I then got pissed and tried to snatch the bottle of water away from her to pour it on her and in the process of the struggle she pulled the bottle away really fast and hit her thumb against a wall which turns out ended up breaking her thumb (we didn't know this at the time). \n\nAfter this I repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused.\n\nI then locked myself in the bathroom and told her I was going to call security; it was at that moment she began to scream saying 'Don't fucking call security!' whilst trying to force open the bathroom door, I didn't want to create drama in my uni halls in front of my room mates (who I didn't really know well) so I held off from calling security (bad decision I know).  \n\nOnce it seemed she calmed down I came out the bathroom and the arguing continued. Once again after we verbally insulted each other my girlfriend then slapped me again, at the point I was beginning to lose it but I didn't slap her back. I tried to restrain her and in the process she began trying choke me, I then threw her into the bed to get her away from me.\n\nShe got back up and tried to push me again but was unsuccessful. Fast forwarding after more arguing we finally calmed down slightly and there was a silent pause, I then kneeled down to put my charger into a socket and out of no where my girlfriend just pushed me hard and I got knocked into a chair. \n\nAt this point. I fucking lose it. \n\nI get up, I grab my girlfriend and push her so hard that she goes flying backwards at least 3-4 yards and smashes her back into my door. BANG. \n\nAll of sudden she lets off a shriek of pain. Real fucking loud. \n\nRemember my neighbors who I mentioned earlier that I don't really know? They hear the screaming and at least 4 guys show up outside my door hearing her screaming 'You pushed me! You pushed me!'. \n\nThey in turn say \"Don't worry we're outside, if he's treating you badly we're here and we've already called security!.\" She then tells these guys who are outside my door to get ALL of her friends that live upstairs with her, within 3 minutes I have at least 20 people outside of my door thinking I've just beat my girlfriend up. \n\nSecurity arrive and ask me to open the door; I do so and immediately 3 security guards come inside and begin asking what's happened. My girlfriend makes up a story about how she fell despite the fact that she just told the guys outside something entirely different. \n\nAs if this couldn't get any worse about 5 minutes later I receive another knock at the door ordering me to open the door. It's the police. \n\nOne of the students had called police and upon opening the door these two massive officers walk in. One immediately asks me to leave the room and come outside with him; I do so and as I walk into the corridor I see the looks of all these people I that had once liked me look at me with disgust; no one says anything to me. \n\nI'm questioned and let go and according to my girlfriend the police had asked her if she wanted to press charges; she declined.\n\nI walked back and I saw everyone from my floor, everyone from her floor, all our mutual friends as well as her close friends from back home who were visiting outside my room once again giving me the most disgusted look thinking I had just beaten her up. \n\nNeedless to say I lost all my friends that day and no one cared to even ask me about my side of the story. \n\nAt university I now have no friends, and will have to live off campus by myself which means making new friends will be incredibly difficult, it's not helped by the fact that I'm really introverted. I'm also terrified of the prospect of even going out to freshers week as there is only one club at my university and I won't have anyone to go with and anyone that I do bump into from last year will make it really awkward. \n\nThis literally keeps me up at night, so tell me, was I an ass hole? \n\nEdit* - I've realised that me and my girlfriend can no longer be together.\n\nEdit edit* - I just realised PKA is being recorded tonight, perhaps this will be featured on the show. I'd love to hear all your thoughts. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I started having prostate orgasms earlier this year. Upon hearing this news my wife wanted to see me have one. Because we have what I thought at the time was a healthy sex life, I obliged. She witnessed my quaking orgasm and almost immediately became jealous and slightly hostile. Jealous is the word she used when I asked her what was wrong. She says that she should be the one that gives me the best orgasms not some toy. I don't disagree with this assessment which is why I think she needs to step up her game in the bedroom. Her answer on the other hand is to simply deny me sex if she suspects that I have been masturbating. I think all of this is fucking ridiculous because I just started using sex toys recently while she has been using them for years. She even uses a vibrator for her clitoris while we are actually having sex. I don't mind this at all. I think that any job which is important is a job which requires tools. As far as I'm concerned, sexual health and satisfaction are important and therefore require the use of specialized tools such as dildos, vibrators, porn, whips, etc. I don't think she has any right to try to discourage me from behaving the same way she does.\n\nThe only reason why I think I could even possibly be the asshole in this situation is because early in our marriage when I found out she was using sex toys for masturbating I felt some trepidation. She told me that despite the size difference between my penis and her dildos ( I'm smaller ) sex was still great. She also explained to me that she needed to have her clitoris stimulated during intercourse in order to orgasm consistently. I was able to exercise the anxiety I felt about toys over the course of a few months once we started using vibrators during sex. I understand that she might need some time to get used to this idea but I don't think I should be punished with a no sex policy in the meantime. Especially since she is still using dildos. Am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "[disclaimer: The asshole/not an asshole question is mostly about my teacher and partially me. I'm making this because I'm not really that sure if he is one or not, but I will be making this from my point of view]\n\nContext: My Theology teacher (male, approx 35) was supposed to go to a doctors appointment, but the sub was unable to fill in, so he probably became pissed that day. I am a male senior in highschool probably pissed him off.\n\nIn Theology class, my teacher (I'll call him Mr. Johnson) asked the class who has their homework from his desk. I said that I did, since I was close to him, I decided to try to hand it to him. Unfortunately, the distance between me and him was about a yard, so I tossed it onto his desk. He caught it and then ripped the paper and saying, \"You don't throw things to me.\" in a stern voice and then threw the shreds in the recycling bin.\n\nI decided that I would pick up what's left of my homework after class. About 5 minutes after Mr. Johnson ripped up my homework, another teacher (I'll call her Ms. Robertson) came into class asking for the recycling bin, so I was unable to take back my homework, tape it back together, and attempt to try to return it in. Because Ms. Robertson \"just happened\" to come into the class asking for the recycling bin, I'm very positive that Mr. Johnson did this, since he already knew that Ms. Robertson will come in for the bin.\n\nLater on in class, one of my classmates (I'll call him Sean) turned around and told me that two years ago, Mr. Johnson burned his notes in class. It turns out that, at the time, Mr. Johnson told Sean to not take notes, so Mr. Johnson put Sean's notes into a bowl and lit them on fire. After hearing this, Mr. Johnson's behavior is not that abnormal to my situation.\n\nCoincidentally, the topic of Plato's interpretation of 'what is evil?' came. Accoriding to Plato, there is not such thing as not good and that evil is just not accepting good. In a way, Mr. Johnson tearing my paper can be seen as him teaching me a lesson on respect/his untold class rules. After school, I asked him if I could make up the homework. He said not to worry about it and that he will accept it. Basically, this entire situation was an extremely harsh 'slap on the wrist' scare tactic punishment from my teacher.\n\nSo, what I'm trying to ask is, is Mr. Johnson an asshole for over reacting, or do I deserve what happened because of my disrepect?\n\nTL;DR: Teacher, probably pissed because sub no-showed, ripped up my homework because I tossed it to him when he was a couple of inches away. He saw that as disrepect, and decided to teach me a lesson about respect, but he ended up taking the homework in the end.",

He claims I'm doing this to young and that I am ridiculous for even moving as \"fast\" as we are we have been together for 5 YEARS! Now I do understand that 5 years isn't that long but long enough for her and my self.

We waited long enough for us to order, get our kebabs, eat them and give up on waiting. After asking what's taking so long we were asked to leave the store. We defended ourselves and again asked for our chips. The employee demanded \"get the fuck out of the shop\" that we leave the store. I told him not to be rude \"don't be a cunt mate, we ordered chips and just want them\" to us and he got worked up. (Australians use that word far more than other countries. More like don't be an asshole)\nThen the employee grabbed my friend by the throat and pushed him out of the shop. I pushed him to let go but he grabbed me by the scruff of my jacket and held me there. The other employee apologised for the wait and took responsibility of the mistake but it was too late. What should have been basic customer service complaint handling became a physical assault. Once we were let go I walked over to the security guard and rather than keep things secure, he kicked me in the chest. I asked for his badge number and he laughed at me saying that he didn't have to. I repeatedly said that it's against the law not to give it to me. I walked off without his number but I finally got some chips. \n\nTL;DR We complained about a long wait for food. The employee got rude and kicked us out of his shop for no reason. I told him not to be a cunt and he dragged my mate out by his neck.

My managers notice my hard work and as a result of this they like me and began to give me a lot of hours.

He was never a super hard worker and always had an attitude, like disrespecting managers, as well as other employees. He has been written up and had several meetings with managers regarding his unprofessional behaviour and attitude. So the other day when he was acting out which included breaking many rules, safety standards which almost injured me, making a violent threat/ remark about wanting to kill a manager (empty dark joke but treat nonetheless because he had a knife on him, and just being a jerk in general. I reported it to a manager who I trust and likes me. They then sent him home early and told me that he would have one final meeting with managers as well as the store owner. Needless to say he was fired, and just recently texted me saying \"Thanks for getting me fired\". So, am I the bad guy here?\n\nTLDR; Co-worker at part-time job was being unsafe, rude, disrespectful against managers, (which has been happening for some time) and as a result I reported it and got him fired.\n\nEDIT: I also just found out that he was sexually harassing several of the girls there.

I found tissues, condoms, socks, hair etc. Anyways i said nothing and spent 2 days scrubbing the place clean.. All good.\nNow after being there 2 weeks and finally settling in they have told me they have a list of 18 \"things\" that need doing, and will need access fairly often over the next month.

I assume all this info is true, because she was never showing, and didn't need to tell me anything about the pregnancy but told me the story anyway.  \n\nTL:DR 3: **I am constantly silently ashamed of the fact that I have never breathed a word of disapproval to her over this.**  I really don't know what I think I should do, but I know that if I had a friend and I saw him stab a stranger to death in the street and he somehow was found innocent at trial, I would ostracize him.  I would no longer count him as a friend or associate with him if I could help it.  I would have to do something to say that that shit isn't cool, and I have no interest in associating with someone capable of that.  In my mind, abortion without extreme extenuating circumstances is an order of magnitude more heinous act; the victim is infinitely more innocent and defenseless, and the killer is infinitely more directly responsible for that victim's protection.  It's just not a crime the law can punish. \n\nSo, assholery judges...is it fucked up that I basically let it slide?  Is it fucked up that I even think I shouldn't?  Or is my part in this all ok?",

So after some searching around....**BINGO**, I find a Facebook page with about 3000 people, where they trade and sell their old textbooks. So I quickly type up a post, selling all my textbooks. I wanted to get rid of them ASAP, selling them for way cheaper then the other users. I see people selling this particular Math text in the range for 100-150$, \"fuck it\" I say to myself, and put it up for 60$ flat. *Ding* I get a message by a girl, saying that she doesn't have a lot of money and would 40$ be enough. My inner sweetness comes out and I say \"sure, as long as you pick it up\" (PS: House is like a 20-25 Minute drive from that University) She says sure, gives me a time and we are all set. *4:00pm comes along*, and I kid you not, this bitch rolls up in an All-black Mercedes that could probably pay for my 4-years tuition. Trying to understand why that girl needs to buy used textbooks, let alone try and wager me down an already steal of a price, I walk downstairs and open the door. \"Hey, I'm Here to pick up the Math Text\", \"Cool I said\" as I grab the textbook. \"40$ right?\" I said, and this b*tch.... this b*tch....Says these exact words. \"*Well, I Only have 15$ on me, and since I had to drive out here I thought that was fair.*\" Being in an already grumpy mood today, I fucking lost it. I don't think I have ever called a girl a C*unt before, let alone 10-15 times in one 1-2 min rant. *snap*, Her eyes go from that blank stare of WTF is happening, too a teary-eyed about to blow in like 1.2 seconds, her mouth moved but nothing came out, and she runs back to her car, *Insert starting up car noise here* and drives off. I think i'll just burn my textbooks from now on.\n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\n------------------------------------Update 1------------------------------------------------------\n\nSold the textbook for 60$ to a guy, told him about what happened last time.

Within a day my mother smelled the substance and told me that I wasn't allowed to have it in her house because it's illegal. Fair enough. I took it out to the shed and put it there on her recommendation. A little while later whilst they were on holiday I took it down to a nearby city and smoked most of it with some friends who I met there.\n\nThis was whilst my family were on holiday.\n\nI came back and since I still had a little bit left I left it in my back and forgot about it. Sure enough, the morning after they came back my mother smelled it again. She asked if I still had the weed and without thinking I said no.\n\nA few days later I was searching through my bag and came across it. Rather than waiting for them to leave and putting it in the shed, I admitted that I had it and went to put it in the shed. She went ballistic.\n\nI was told about how disgusting it was that I was smoking it and how horrible I was for bringing it into her house again. I was threatened to have the police called on me all as I tried to defend myself by asking:\n\n\"How is having pot in the house going to affect anybody negatively. The fact that you've got a little bit of pot in your shed hardly eats away at your mind every minute of every day, does it?\"\n\nThis was greeted with more yelling, followed by her calling my father, who I don't have a very good relationship with anyway. He was passed on to me, again threatening to call the police on me. Again, I asked how calling the police would have any positive outcome on anybody. I was told that it'd teach me a lesson. \n\nAfter that I went up to my room, logged onto Reddit, and wrote this post.\n\nSo I implore you, am I the asshole?",

And adding to that there was a group of nerds there loudly talking about what kind of erotic games theyve played and what hentai they enjoyed. While I tend to enjoy anime as well I thought these people to be wrong at that course as it cleary stated the language course would cover formal japanese, for those wishing to work or research in Japan and the Lecturer even told us that people who came there just because they liked manga or anime were at the wrong place. \n\nSo they made us write our names on paper and drew the names of the people allowed to take the course nevermind if they signed in beforehand or not. \n\nAfter not being picked I spoke to the lecturers assistant about the fact that a lot of the people chosen didnt sign up for that course.

No big deal, its a less than $200 repair in this instance.(the only injury worth noting was my pride) So i got off work late that same night around 12:30am and got home a little before 1am. I live in a closely packed condo neighborhood. I wanted to look at something on my bike so i partially pulled in my car to the driveway and left the headlights on for light. Before i knew it i was an hour or so in (around 2-2:30) and my car was near dead. (I was not intending to stay that long, but the time slipped by). So i put the car in neutral and put it in a little street where there would be assuredly no trafick however there were people nearby so i knew i would have to act fast. I pulled the second car up (my moms in this case) and began to work but naturally some things needed to be adjusted primarily car positioning for the cables. So i was there for about 5 minutes with the engine running before 2 different neighbors came out and started asking me what i was doing, talking about how late it was, and telling me how inconsiderate i was. I quickly but profusely apoligized and explained my circumstances but they werent having it. I got the car started after much micromanaging and complaining. So i set to launch the first car off then boom i bumped my car with my moms car. this was primarily due to all the stress i was put under by my neighbors. The damage was miniscule to none and obviously i would make sure if there was a problem it would get fixed.Without even getting out of the car to assess damage i pulled off to go park it. So that was fine and dealt with so i headed back for the other car and my neighbor says to me \"dont hit my car on your way in\" and that just really set me off.(despite my ever so shitty day i do take pride in my driving) I contained myself because i didnt want to make things worse and i left the neighborhood because there was no parking available. There was no parking anywhere in the street either so instead of going back to make more noise im just sitting here in a parking lot typing this out.\nAm I the asshole?",

In my opinion, if someone is giving you a ride, and they waited 5 minutes while also trying to contact that person multiple times without any response, then they have the right to leave when they said there were going to. Its not bothering either of us anymore, but it really pissed him off and I was kind of indifferent to it. I wouldn't have left if I was his only way of getting to school. But his mom or dad could've taken him. I did feel bad a little because I was late anyway, but if he had come out when he said he would've, neither of us would've been late. Instead I got another tardy and he got his dad to excuse him so he didn't get one. I could've handled it differently I realize, but I don't think I'm in the wrong here. At least not completely. So am I the asshole?",

She usually stays with my mom during our visits.\n\nThis particular visit, it's labor day weekend. My mom is going to Hilton Head, but promised me weeks in advance that she would find a place for my dog while she was gone.\n\nNow, it's Friday, she tells me she never found a place for my dog, she forgot completely.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. So I have a conflict I'm trying to resolve and need external opinions on who is the asshole here. Here is the backstory:\n\nSo the conflict begins with our downstairs PlayStation 3. One member of the household, I will call him *Bob*, notices something is keeping him from being able to login to the netflix app. We have the PS3 setup with multiple *local* accounts, and the only way for *Bob* to login to his netflix account is by being in his local account. One day he opens up the PS3 which auto logs into *my* local account, sees he is not able to login to netflix then sees that because the netflix login is showing my PSN e-mail I must somehow be trying to use their netflix without permission and am fucking up their netflix in general (that isn't true of course. the netflix app login automatically shows the e-mail of the PSN account associated with the logged in *local* account regardless of whether that e-mail actually has access to netflix).\n\nSo the other person, let's call her *Jillian*, finds out about this (she my father's girlfriend) and misinterprets the situation as *Bob* does, gets angry, then sends me this text:\n\n&gt;Please do not create any account and put password in the Netflix/TV in the front..You have no business and should create an account to Netflix that *Bob's* paying..I need to you delete your account in they front room tv...And don't do that ever again..!.\n\nOk, so this text from my perspective is fucking disgusting. For one, she automatically assumes that I must be tampering with netflix and am therefore in the wrong. \"have no business\"...really, is that what you have to say? This is especially offensive because I am known for sticking to what I know is right at all times. I have never logged into netflix, that is just the PS3 showing my info because the wrong *local account* was logged into. Next, she wants me to delete my fucking *account*. Now the fix is easy (to change which local account auto logs in, or just switch the local account at startup), so we have no need for that. Also, I play games on the PS3. I use my local account for my PSN account, and I already have permission to play games on the PS3. Last, she tells me to \"never do that again.\" I didn't do anything in the first place. So basically this text is loaded with a bunch of bullshit assumptions put in a really aggressive \"I didn't think about anything fuck you\" kind of way. \n\nSo the next day I talk to *Bob*, we set it straight, I fix it, we're good (*Bob* and I are always cool but he also sometimes assumes things about what I do, but doesn't get angry about it just waits for someone to solve it). He tells me he's noticed she gets extra pissy at the beginning of the month, and it makes me give her a little more credit, but I'm still not ok with what she said. At that time we do agree that he will talk to her, and that I shouldn't talk to her. Well, being me, I wrongly broke that promise and still wanted to make sure *Jillian* and I were personally on the same level of understanding. So the next day I talk to *Jillian* just to resolve it between us personally. I tell her, look, you misinterpreted what happened, so can we prevent this from happening again in the future? Think about the possibilities of the situation and don't just assume the worst *and* then go about and get loud and make assumptions about me in a text. Now I was very calm in this argument throughout, never trying to offend her, but then she EXPLODES on me and starts telling me how wrong I am, how much of a baby I am that I \"can't take\" her at her worst, and literally throws EVERY insult that relates to my own insecurities which have nothing to do with the actual conversation. She says how \"you have the audacity to come here after a long day, when I haven't thought about this at all today, to give me an **ULTIMATUM** not to text you? Well guess what, if you can't handle me at my worst you sure don't deserve me at my best, if you can't then get the fuck out of this house\". And my response of course was that I just meant any overly assumptive texts like the one she sent me. Not once did I insult her or attempt to spark aggression. \n\nIt was the most ridiculous reaction I have ever seen in any argument I have ever been in. She says she showed the text to her daughter who said it was \"fine\" or some shit. Well guess what, for those who know of MBTI, both her and her daughter are ESFJs so of course you both are blind to what you're actually saying. (I'm an INFP personally. I think thoroughly about everything and when I *know* someone is in the wrong I *know* it, but maybe my perspective here still is wrong). Also, remember *Bob* told me in our original conversation (before I approached *Jillian*) that it could be that it's that time of the month for her/her period (and that he has noticed she gets in this mood at the beginning of the month), which makes it even harder for me to gauge this. Because while she's known for going out of control, it's still extra fucked up even for her. And when I showed the text to my dad even he said \"there's nothing wrong with it, yeah that is something I would have said too\" (he's an ISFJ so he also has similar thought patterns to *Jillian*). But my dad *was* there for the huge argument, and he took my side and was totally not ok with her outburst of insults and anger.\n\nSo this leads to her going on full panic loud aggressive mode and I've been avoiding her for days, she even texted me again saying that she broke up with my dad and it's \"all because of me...congratulations!\" (but every time they \"break up\" they just get back together again for various reasons that are too much to get into right now).\n \nSo, am I the asshole here, or what? My personal conclusion is that while I made a couple *mistakes* in my handling of the situation, I wasn't actually an asshole while she clearly was. ",

    "selftext": "For context, I have a couple roommates and one of them shares the garage with me - he keeps his rarely driven luxury car in it along with my Camry.  Sometime in the past month (roughly early August) I had a few different people stay with me for various reasons, during which time I had more passengers than just myself, and in late August (at least two weeks later) my roommate discovered that somebody had opened my rear door too much and it hit his car, causing some paint to be chipped off (around 4mm in diameter).  I have no clue when or who did this but it likely was somebody that was visiting - it definitely wasn't me since I don't sit in the back but I will take responsibility for my guests.  He notices this and brings it up to me - he says he will go get an estimate on it, I apologize and ask how much he thinks it will be, he has no idea but I just throw out a number of $300 that I would be fine compensating.  He goes and gets a quote from his favorite body shop, they tell him they need to repaint the whole piece (rear fender) and reblend the paint on the entire side of the car, total cost $1,600.  He tells me this and am I shocked on how serious he is - I suppose we live different lives with different priorities, but I can't fathom spending such an insane amount of money to fix such a small paint chip.  However, it's his car and that's what he wants to do and I can certainly respect his intentions but feel this is just such an insane amount of money.  One morning he says he wants to take it to the shop the next day, then heads off to work and so do I, not saying much after.  I decide to send an email telling him that I'm trying to be reasonable and kind here, but $1,600 is just insane, our garage is not a showroom, we have people walk between our cars every day and the car isn't covered, something like this has a chance of happening.  I regret what possibly happened with my friends/family doing this and increased the amount of money I'm willing to pay to $500, but that's really as high as I'm going.  He then decides that insurance is probably the best way to go about this, so I send over my information but I'm not really sure comprehensive covers things like this...in any case I sent things over but haven't heard if it worked or not.\n\nLater that night he and his girlfriend come home (they both live here), my roommate walks right past and the girlfriend comes up to me and says what I'm doing is wrong, that I should have apologized at the beginning and offered my insurance information.  I state how I didn't know this happened (and neither did they) for several weeks, and even now I can't see the paint chip from five feet away.  Also the insurance was just brought up today and I sent over the info.\n\nNow we have an insanely toxic relationship in the house, nobody talks to anybody and this has just made things horrible - I went to a concert last night but couldn't enjoy it because I kept thinking about this whole thing...\n\nAITA?  Assuming the insurance route doesn't pan out, is it reasonable to expect me to dish out $1,600 due to something like this?  Or $500?  Or anything?  I've heard the full range from people, I'd like to crowdsource this thing to see what the universe thinks.  I'm also trying to dig down to the actual truth of the situation and (trying to) paint it as a black and white situation, but really can't.  I think the core of this to me is that I don't really care about minor blemishes on my car, having an immaculate car stresses me out so I'd rather have a few dings to relax about it - clearly my roommate sees things differently.  And if it were something else, like a shirt or tie or appliance or something (or if I wrecked the car for some reason) I would happily replace it, because they are entitled to own that thing and I would have 'taken it away' by breaking it.  But for something like this, where the car functionality was not affected and I STILL can't see the chip from a few feet away, it's just not an expenditure I can empathize with and $1,600 is a lot of money...\n\nSorry for the ramble - once again, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I spoke with my roommate over text today to try and clear things up, stating how I felt it was unreasonable to expect perfection to be maintained in such an environment.  Not to mention our other roommate (that is sadly caught in the middle of this) stated that if he caused this then he couldn't afford $1600, or even $500, and that he had casually spun his keys around or slung his backpack inches from this car on many occasions.  We had no idea that a $2k bill would come up from such a minor mistake.  My roommate didn't take that well, stating that somebody needs to make him whole with this and he will not pay for damage not caused by himself.  Not really sure where we're going with this now, insurance has been contacted but I'm not optimistic for the outcome...",

I said I was not willing to make that agreement to not let him in because he tends to meow at my bedroom window at night to be let in and I don't want her cat to inconvenience me and I also don't think it's cool to throw an elderly cat outside with no shelter.  I offered to find a rescue centre or a new home to take him if they really felt they couldn't care for him any longer.  She left the conversation without discussing rehoming him further or negotiating with me that I don't want the cat living on the shared porch. After that discussion I gave them a covered litterbox with pine shavings to see if that could encourage him to use the litter more. They brought the litterbox in but not the cat.\n\nWe have found the cat without water 6 times in 30+C degree weather. (it's been a hot summer)  The shelter they have provided him is an uncovered bin that I originally put in the shared hallway to organize the miscellaneous baby clothes that get left in there when they come and go from the apt.  \n\nIn one especially hot week we had 7 people within three days come to us and express concern over the cat's welfare. One of those days we had 5 people (it was over 40C degrees with the humidity.)  Early that day my SO was confronted by a passerby who wanted to know if he was a stray.  At that moment the neighbour wife came home and said to the passerby that it's her cat but they could take him if they want.  Later on that night an Animal Rescue volunteer who had stopped a raccoon from attacking him rang our doorbell at 1130pm. We came out and addressed the situation, made sure he was okay and clarified he was owned and not a stray (he is thin, has a ripped ear and his coat is dull so it's easy to confuse him as being homeless.)\n\nI did my research that night and found someone close by who was willing to take him in.  At this point I was still friends with the neighbours.  The next day I confronted the wife when she came into the backyard and said that it's really uncool we keep having to respond to people about her cat when it's known we do not like the idea of him living on the porch.  I said that I found him a home if they are willing.  That's when she flipped saying that I was trying to steal her cat and it was none of our business.  When I brought up that she told someone to take him she said she was joking.  We continued to yell at each other until my SO came out and diffused the situation. (SO is not as hotheaded as I am) SO told her that she needs to get the cat a collar, register him with the city, provide more appropriate shelter and we will not tolerate being inconvenienced by him again.  That night she sent us a series of texts saying that we have no business talking to people about her cat and that I am trying to force her hand to get rid of him and that we share a backyard, not a life. That's when the friendship ended.\n\nThe next day my buddy came by and felt it was necessary to report the treatment of the cat to animal services.  A few days later animal services came by but the neighbours wouldn't answer their door so we addressed the call.  The animal services rep said that city bylaws allow a cat to be permanently outdoors so long as they are not a nuisance.  She did note that the cat was not registered and was slightly dehydrated and wrote up a warning notice.  We confirmed with her that he is a nuisance to us but not in that annoying sense more that we are tired of dealing with seeing him in that condition and we are tired of people knocking on our door.  \n\nSo, main question is, what they are doing is not against the law but we feel it's an inconvenience to us. Are we just too uptight?  They have retaliated aggressively that I will leave out in the main body so we can determine if we caused this issue by being assholes. They do give him food every day and are now bringing the food (not the cat) in at night after I complained about the raccoons and animal services came by. \n\nI have pics of the porch and cat if that will help yous determine if I'm the asshole. I may just be uptight.",

She only lived down the street from me and our houses are designed exactly the same, and they had it in the livingroom. I also read up on cats so I could learn more than I already knew, and a website told me the best place to keep a litter box was in an open space, so it wouldn't smell. Well today my mom yells at me for having the litter box in the livingroom and tells me \"Either put it in your room or you're getting rid of the cat.\"\n\nShe had no problem with me getting a cat, and she specifically said she would get me what I needed, as long as I cleaned the litterbox and took care of her. I take care of her well, and I clean it once a day, midday. The litter the owner gave me to start with isn't clumping litter, so when she pees, i cant scoop it up. It smells in a confined space, like my room, which was why I moved it to the livingroom. After they moved it into my room, I put it in the bathroom, thinking it was a compromise and the next best place for litter boxes. That wasn't good for my mom aka madam Fuhrer and threatened giving away the cat again. She knows how much this cat means to me and how much I love the cat, so I don't understand why she thinks threatening me is an effective way to do this.\n\nShe also refuses to buy me what I need to take care of my cat. Right now, she living off age inappropriate food that I got from my neighbor with cats and still the litter the previous owner gave me. I researched all I needed to know about cats, and I know that cats need exercise and to be played with, which is why I need toys. She needs to be rewarded for doing good things, which is why treats are important. Food and litter is obvious. She also really needs to see a vet because she seems to have feline lice. The owner never told me about this, either. My mom refuses, like *downright refuses* to pay for anything for her. When I bring up getting a job, she says no, or that I'd have to walk. The nearest age-available job is Burger King...4 blocks away. They aren't even hiring. Anywhere else I can't apply to because they either don't hire at 16 or they are too far away to walk to. I really want to take care of this cat and prove my responsibility, but she is going back on her word.\n\nIs this my fault?",

I moved in because I split with my wife, and a big part of our split had to do with differing drives and attitudes toward sex. I've been dating again, and I'm seeing a couple of women. Sometimes I stay with one of them, sometimes they stay with me. We have really awesome sex when we do, and I'm really happy with how things are going.\n\nNormally, we're sleeping by 12:30, which is, admittedly, late even for me.

Last night, I had someone over, and we had some fun between 11:00 and 12:30. We knew we had to keep it down, and I think we did a pretty good job. Nevertheless, I got a message today asking me to try to keep it down. (Which, again, we were)\n\nI've lived with roommates before, and it hasn't been a problem.

At the end of the night the fast food stores close by to the night club are open till late to accommodate for the drunken young college students (I being one of them) wanting a late night snack.\n\nAnyway while in the line where there were 2 girls a head of me for the toilet which was in cramped room, the toilet door opened and a guy came out of the toilet which was one of the girls friends. His hands were wet and he rubbed his wet hands  on his friend.

I think I received a minor concussion. \n  \nThe guy and the girls had left the room I think soon after the incident and any way I left the room and noticed them in a booth and one of the girls who was there was pointing at me and looked to be telling her other friends about what happened. I then approached the booth and everyone said I was in the wrong there because of my actions towards the girls and that I deserved to get hit. \n\nI then approached the security guard on duty at the store and I told him about what happened and he went to verify the story with the other party. He then returned and basically told me I was in the wrong as I called them names. He then escorted me off the premises. \n\nToday I have had a headache that has only got worse , a noticeable bump on the side of my head along with little bit of nausea and lack of balance. \n\nMaybe I over reacted but I dont want strangers rubbing my hair and drying their hands with it.

She responded that she had free time between 1:30 and 9:30 pm. Since I couldn't be free til around 7, I asked if we should choose another day. She thought that we would still have some decent time, so we might as well go for it. Even though I wanted the night to go later, I didn't put too much thought into it and agreed. Fast forward to the night, we went to a local coffee shop where I bought her gelato, and we had a great time. Later on she showed me her dorm and projects she had recently worked on for classes. Everything went great until 10 pm came and she said we'd have to end our time because she was meeting up with another guy. Now I'll admit I don't really have the intentions of dating her seriously long term, but with that being said, I felt a little bit like I was just the appetizer warming her up for her second date that night.

So my dad (who treats me like a little kid even though I'm 16) asks me and my sister, \"Okay, who wants ICE CREAM?\", and so I don't respond. Anyways, he serves my sister her ice cream, and when he goes to serve mine, I tell him, \"it's fine I want to scoop my own\" and he starts getting difficult telling me that he's going to serve me my ice cream. I keep telling him that I want him to let me do it, but eventually he just got so fed-up and put my cone scoop-down into the container while telling me, \"Don't be such an idiot\". So, am I the asshole?\n\nE: Just wanted to make it clear; I'm aware that the situation was stupid and childish.

He came over and I took care of him, let him sleep in my recliner, and I haven't heard from him since despite two legit attempts. I can only assume it's over...both FWB and the friendship. \n\nHis cousin and I had started hanging out a week prior to the babysitting episode with my former FWB and I refused to sleep with him because I didn't know if that would hurt my former FWBs feelings. Well, after he stopped talking to me, the cousin and I hooked up and both immediately regretted it and have sworn to never do it again. We still hang out every weekend, but no sex. However, I still feel like an asshole. Should I? My former FWB has never considered my feelings when hooking up with other girls right in front of me, he lies to me and tells me he loves me and I have taken care of him and looked out for him and he still does that to me. But still, I'm not him and this guilt is bothering me. He knows his cousin and I hang out because he drops me off after a night of hanging out and my FWB lives next to me so he's seen it. I still have anxiety over telling him or his brother the truth if they ever ask. I have no problem admitting it, but I feel like an asshole because this is a family relation.\n\nAm I an asshole?",

    "selftext": "I never really wanted to go to college, if I am successful I'd be the only member of either of my close families that has a four year degree which I feel puts a bit of pressure on me. Ive just never met someone who's happy living life the way i'm supposed to strive for, I see miserable workers, constant divorces, and dead end lives where you need to buy things that give you debt so that you can have money to pay off your debts. The life just doesn't seem satisfying in any way. Now that i'm in college i'm undeclared, I have no friends, i'm doing work I hate, but all eyes are on me. Im the family baby, the last one to grow up and everyones so proud of me, they gave me a few thousand bucks to deal with my bills (total school cost gonna be somewhere between 80-100k) and sent me well wishes, threw me a party at a nice restaruant, I had motivational talks with my grandparents and close family friends. But i'm here now, and my grades are slipping, I have nobody to talk to since I have no friends so I just think all day. I think about how i'm a lazy bastard for missing homework and how i'm scum for letting down all these people, and how even if I do succeed ill be stuck doing something I hate for the rest of my life until I die. \n\nTo explain the title, I think I'd like to live a life on the road, I've always been introverted, I can go days without saying much besides hello and thank you, but have never had much in the way of problems holding a conversation. I admit, I played a lot of adventure games when I was young, books too, the whole shebang, was a boy scout, loved the woods, loved hiking, so maybe i'm looking at a bit on an idealized world. I'd like to visit places, cities all over the world without worrying about bills, travel the countryside and climb mountains maybe. See beautiful amazing things, squatting in buildings and maybe dumpster dive for money, maybe even write a book or two. This may sound kind of crummy for some of you, but I envy this kind of freedom, I just want to live off of my own terms, eat something that I actually hunted, make something out of nothing. So maybe my idea is a bit rosy, and maybe I am a bit naive for thinking it'll all just be okay. Maybe ill go all \"call of the wild\" and end up starving to death lost in the woods, maybe ill drown sleeping in a drainpipe when a surprise flood comes in, or maybe ill get shanked in some alleyway for my iphone. Any of these things could happen, but I feel that if I stay on the course Im currently going I may live a long and miserable life, with a family that hates me and a job where I do nothing of importance, clinging to the hope that if my children get enough money for college that they instead will have a fulfilling life.\n\nSo am I the asshole? What should I do? Am I being a naive little first world brat who doesn't see a good thing when he has it, or am I a kid who should go take a chance and explore the world. This may not be the deciding factor in my ultimate choice but I have nowhere else to turn, so your opinions are valued more than you know. \n\nTL;DR: School and family expectations missaligned with wishes for a free and simple life.",

That all was planned on a ts-server without the knowledge of friend P. A table was reserved for 5 men.\n\nToday, I put a message in a whatsapp group that included my 4 friends, but also among 5 other people, P. The message was the question who would be the driver.\n\nUnknown by me, P also met a friend of mine while shopping and that friend of mine told him we had plans for today and slightly hinted that it might be bad if he showed up. \n\nP is an aquaintance more that he is a friend, meaning I dont really dislike him but we've got nothing in common. My favorite topics annoy him and vice versa. So I didnt invite him on purpose. \n\nSo now he posts in that Whats app group offering to drive. \n\nI tried hinting strongly that he wasnt welcome to tag along, but he stated, quoting the friend he met, that it was  ok.\n\nSo now I tell him in private that I am very sorry, but I planned to celebrate in a small circle and that he is welcome to tag along any other time. He askes me to post that to the group and I did, feeling that I owe him.\n\nSo he goes on to post that he doesnt mind being not invited but goes on a rant how he founded that group to organize events where everyone can tag along and how it is shitty to organize a \"private\" event in that group. (It comprises 9 members, all more or less close friends). Also he says hes annoyed by other things being discussed all the time. \n\nProblem is that group was never really used for that purpose but as a means to talk about all the random shit we want to share among friends. Thats what I told him. I told him politely that we could make a new group if its too much Off-topic in there.  Now I am waiting for a reply.\n\nReddit, was I the asshole in that situation, or was there no better way to handle it?\n\nEdit: numbers didnt match up ",

    "selftext": "So too start i just have to say this is my first post and found this sub-reddit through PKA.\n\nOK now that thats out of the way lets start, (Grab some popcorn) so too start all of this of we have to go back when my friend of about 5 years got his first girlfriend we will call her L. and we will call the guy C. at this time i was 15 years old with both L. and C. being 16, so basically me and C. were not best friends however we were pretty close friends through 5 years we were in the same peer group which only at the back end of last year was disbanded through members being Assholes in their own right. Me and C. never had an issue with each other and through the year of L. and C. dating me and L. became pretty close, i never developed feelings for her through this time and had the upmost respect for the two. Others were skeptical if me and L. had done anything together but their was never anything done we just talked a lot online and in real life at school. Then C. and L. broke up about 5-8 months ago from the point of today this caused me too back away from L. because i felt she had issues of her own she had to deal with and i was just weighing her down. (by this i mean that her head wasn't in the right state and she didn't need another guy around her) Also another reason for me backing away was because i know how easily she falls for guys and if i were to still talk to her whilst she was single she would want me to date her which i wasn't willing to do. Throughout this time i moved away from my old group (the asshole group) bringing my best friend with me (Not C.) into a group that i felt was better and so far it has been. However this has caused me and C. to stop all contact with each other as he decided to stay with some members of the old group who i felt were assholes themselves. Anyway now with a very long backstory out of the way we can get into todays topic of me sleeping with L. so we were both at a party, i was drinking and she was not, we didn't really talk to each other throughout the night because as i said we hadn't really spoken like we used to for about 5-8 months. At this party we were both sleeping the night at the house as we are both kind of close friends with the host. We didn't speak for the first few hours of the party but as the night kicked in we both started talking again like we used too (This was at about 2am and i was kind of drunk) people began to fall asleep and we decided to grab a blanket and sleep on the couch together. Although we didn't have sex we did other stuff which I'm not going to go into detail with. So basically we stayed up all night doing stuff and then we both agreed to not tell anyone. (Ofcourse being a guy i told my 4 best friends from my group everything) This leads me to the day after where once we were home we talked over Facebook for a while and then went to sleep for about 12 hours since not getting any sleep the night before. Now this leads me to today, she has asked me to go to the movies and i really don't want to go so i declined because i feel like she has developed feelings and is trying to start a relationship which i really don't want to get into at this point in my life. So i guess I'm just here asking for advice from you guys if i'm an asshole or not. Right now I'm just sitting in my room listening to red hot chilli peppers writing this message. Any help is appreciated and i can take constructive criticism.\n\nSo reddit, am i an Asshole for sleeping with a girl who was once my best friends girlfriend or should i let it go?",

She came over for dinner tonight at my moms and wanted to know if i will come to the event that is a month away and is a couple hours with a bbg.\n\nI said maybe as i have just had back surgery and can't even drive really yet and still on quite a bit of medication. She keeps pestering me and telling me that she wants to have family events. She is pretty much down my throat controlling me telling me she needs to know if I will come so that she can tell me what to bring to a little bbq and kickball game for a couple hours.\n\nI repeatedly say maybe as i don't even know if i can get there or w/e and its a month away, but honestly I would love to go. I have been trying to get our family back together all the time and mend the relationship with my little sister as we always tend to fight. I have been always nice to her and she just constantly shits on me. She keeps saying that she is trying to get this family together so that her 1 year old kid can have a good family growing up. \n\nThen i say \"I have been trying hard to get this family together, but you have been a complete **bitch** to me for years\" in a not super serious almost joking manner. Then she gets all mad and starts to go off on me. Then says to her kid that they need to go home and that I don't want to be part of this family. She keeps telling me, maybe, is not an answer because she needs to tell everyone what to bring.\n\nAfter a bit of bitching from her I just say calmly that just put me down as no and could we please just stop fighting. She keeps going off. \n\nSo now she is all pissed and my mom is a little mad. My mom and I kinda talked it out after pretty calmly as we usually do and I did say sorry to her that I called her a bitch. btw I live at home with my mom and I am a little older than I would like to be living here but, life happens. \n\njust some back ground on how each of us usually act.\n\n - me : very laid back and nothing much will get me angry.

I say maybe as i just had back surgery and she proceeds to control me and tell me I don't want to be apart of this family.

I've been a part of their group for about a year, and to date they're the only people who I can confidently point to and call my friends. However, about half a year ago my depression has picked up. I frequently have fears about being abandoned by this group and reverting back to eating alone at the lunch table as I have done for basically my entire life. During this summer I have attempted suicide twice, and at the beginning of the school year I've been hospitalized once for a serious suicide attempt. Now I am seeing a school counselor in weekly checkups to ensure that I'm mentally well, and my parents have locked away the medication to prevent further attempts.\n\nHowever, this fear is still there, and on a bi-weekly basis I have breakdowns in which I'd turn to my friends for support and help. Although they are there for me I can tell that these breakdowns are taking a toll on them, and that they'd now think twice before planning anything to ensure that I'm well first (the thing that triggered my suicide attempt was an outing they had which they had not informed me about). I can definitely feel that there has been a change in our group dynamic- one that makes me more important than I used to be- and I feel responsible and to an extent guilty for that. \n\nMy breakdowns involve a need to be re-assured that I'm still close to them, and they are a source of stress for the entire group. I have tried to alleviate this stress in many ways, including not turning to them for help as frequently (I call the suicide hotline and use online resources) and not alerting them to the fact that I am about to abuse substances (I still do that on a frequent basis but I don't want to alert them to it) but I still do sometimes need to talk to them and every single time I do that everyone in the group gets extremely stressed out. \n\nI feel very guilty for making them stressed out and in response I've tried to be there for them as much as I can, and I'd, on my own initiative, ask them if they were feeling okay if it was apparent they weren't and try to make them feel better. But I still do feel like I'm more of a burden rather than a member in this group, and sometimes I feel like the best solution to all of this, the best answer that satisfies everyone is to simply cut myself off from this group. I cause a lot of stress and worry and I really do feel like I don't give enough back. But apparently people still want to hold onto sources of stress, and they pull me back in and act as if nothing happened. \n\nI don't know how to give back to them for being there for me as much as they can and I don't know how to cut myself off in order to make everyone happy again. I feel sometimes that suicide is the answer, and that although they seem to don't want it subconsciously they do want me gone because I'm such a burden on everything. I just want to fit in, and by doing so I've become an incredible burden on everything. I feel like I'm taking too much and giving back nothing. \n\nSo am I an asshole for causing so many troubles to everyone around me? Am I an asshole for being me? \n\nPlease respond honestly. To be honest I am sick and tired of fake positivity. Thank you. ",

It was meowing for about an hour.  I decided that I had had enough of my sister not taking care of the animal and so I moved it.  It was clearly not happy in the apartment.  I'm not a vet but I am good with animals and I know a distreesed one when I see it.\n     \nI just got back home today and told my friend about it and she said I shouldn't have done it?

We started with Twilight, then the girl next to me said blurred lines. I asked oh did the song just annoy you or was it like the lyrics?\n\nShe then said just all of it, she really didn't like. \n\nSo I said, aw, I liked it! It was catchy and I think the lyrics were unfairly interpreted. Like how he says \"I hate these blurred lines\" kind of meaning the opposite of what a lot of people assumed.\n\nThen this girl fucking turned on me. She said \"Well as someone with personal experience of saying no and not being listened to, that is what the song is like for me.\"\n\nI instantly said \"Oh I'm sorry that happened, but I just don't see it that way.\"\n\nand then she said \"yes but I'm talking from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE\"\n\nLike jfc I was sitting there like unable to know what to say. I have never been raped, but I have been taken advantage of and as a person with social anxiety that event made me feel awful - however I never saw blurred lines as an anthem of rape culture. \n\nLuckily another friend quickly changed the subject, but I was left feeling really, really awful. Of course I respect her feelings and opinion of the song, I wasn't trying to argue it, just kind of defend my opinion as just that - an opinion, not an admittance of thinking rape is okay. I was talking about THE SONG.  Not fucking rape statistics or the psychology behind such horrible events, and yet I feel like an utter cockwomble. \n\nIn truth, I don't think she should have started a dialogue about a subject so personal to her if she wasn't comfortable accepting someone else's differing opinion on it, but at the same time, in my crappy attempt to back pedal I think I made it worse. \n\nAnyway, she was laughing with me about other stuff before we left and still on snapchat with me so I guess she can't totally hate me, which I'm grateful for as I really like to have a laugh with her. I just have never been made to feel like such a complete arsehole in a conversation before and have no idea if I ought to apologize or something. ",

Last night we went to her boyfriend [20M] \"Max's\" apartment to watch the Falcons game and get drunk. We drank a good bit (not so much that we were blacking out), and then we decided to go swimming in his apartment complex's pool. The water was freezing, so I suggested we take a hot shower. I figured Rachel and Max would shower together, and I'd shower after. Rachel invited me to shower with them, though, and drunk me thought this was a fine idea.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happened. Rachel began to kiss me, we took our bikini tops off, and we had a threesome. The only guideline Rachel gave me was not to have vaginal sex with Max, and I didn't. We engaged purely in oral, although he ended up having sex with her while she and I did other stuff.\n\nI don't remember getting back home, but I did. I didn't spend the night there. I woke up to Rachel asking if she could come over. She did, and she basically told me that she was angry I agreed to having the threesome. Her reasoning was that she was more intoxicated than I was (she did drink more, but as I said, no one was to the point of blacking out), and since I was \"more sober,\" I should have known it would be a bad idea. I told her that this was ridiculous, as all three of us consented. She told me she doesn't know if we can continue to be friends. I think this is stupid. If I had been 100% sober, of course I would have recognized that might have bad consequences. But I was pretty fucked up too, so I don't feel I'm at fault. Additionally, she initiated *everything.* I'm even the one who asked her what she didn't want me to do with Max (sex).\n\nNow, I realize this may not have been the *wisest* decision, but I really want to know if I'm at fault here. The way I see it, this was just a stupid drunken decision by all 3 of us, but I don't think I'm some terrible person by agreeing to something she suggested...so. AITA?",

    "selftext": "So for the past few days my boyfriend got a new phone and has been playing with some kind of music app around me in which he's mixing songs together. I'm hating every minute and gently encouraged him to finish a song and then play that for me, rather than practice around me because some of what he's doing just sounds awful and some sounds really great. I go to a college with a lot of music theatre majors who tend to go around singing in the hallways, which the rest of us at school find profoundly annoying. Sometimes my boyfriend can be really dense, and I'll tell him something and he just won't listen. I've had to explain to him what my major is at school about five times before he finally knew what I was talking about. \n\nAnyway, after he didn't listen to my requests for him to wait to finish a song to play this around me, I decided to be more clear, however I was also kind of mean. I said \"Fucking musicians don't care that nobody wants to hear them practice.\" And explained that I'm subjected to practicing musicians daily and don't want to be subjected to this at home. I was already annoyed at him when I said this because he had taken me to the dentist in my car and didn't have a ride back home. He wanted me to drive him home, and I said \"What was the point of you driving me today? It was to not have to drive today. I'll get you a cab, but I'm really disappointed you did not think this through.\" He thinks it's not a big deal because he got me where I needed to be and figured he would figure the rest out as he went along, but that kind of thing makes me wonder if he's even a reliable enough person to be my boyfriend. I know he doesn't do a very good job planning ahead for anything. I feel like I should have asked a friend for a ride, I have friends who are so much more reliable than he is. \n\nSo today he texts me that I need to be more sensitive to him about his music. I really offended him with the 'fucking musicians' comment. I feel like I'm being generous by calling him a musician, when all he's doing with music is playing with a new app on his phone and he gave up on bass guitar years ago. We've been together since May and if he had thought he was a DJ in May I wouldn't have started dating him. I have always hated the guy at the party who thinks he's a DJ and has no real skills. He knows already that I don't like what I call 'song ADD' wherein a person doesn't play an entire song and keeps skipping and that's basically what he's doing with this app. I've also said \"Remixing a song is like admitting you were wrong\" or \"Why would they remix this song, it's perfect in it's original form\" and other such things, so he does already know that I don't like this sort of thing.\n\nSo which one of us is the bigger asshole right now? I know I'm asshole for using harsh language and knocking his passion, but I also think if he's so passionate about making music, why didn't he do anything like this before he got a new phone? \n\nTL;DR Boyfriend thinks he's a DJ on his iPhone and I said musicians suck for thinking everyone wants to hear them practice.",

He had recently moved to the area and had been living rent-free with family (cousin), but really wanted his own place.\nWe settle on this sweet loft. Unfortunately for him, right when my lease is up, he has something coming up at work that is ALL-CONSUMING for a few weeks. Regardless, he still agrees to move forward. We sign the lease and put down the deposit. However, when it comes time for first month's rent, his check bounces. There's some excuse that his \"direct deposit didn't come on time, etc.\" Whatever. He's super busy with work so I play it cool. I don't want to be a dick. Like I said the guy is really nice, and I would like the roommate relationship to start off on the right foot. Fast forward 2+ weeks - The guy still hasn't moved in due to 'being so busy with work' and still has not paid. We're at the 20th of the month when he finally gets to moving in, and I bring up getting paid for rent.\nHe hangs his head and immediately things get awkward. He starts saying things like, \"yeahh, it just sucks paying full rent for 10 days, I know it's what we agreed upon but still... etc. etc.\" I'm pretty unsympathetic since I feel I've been extremely patient with the whole thing. I handle it well and am just like \"dude, I know it sucks but that's what the deal is. You can't just decide not to move-in and then not pay rent.\" I basically do the whole, 'not my problem' thing without being a dick. He reluctantly agrees and pays like a sad puppy.\nAnd here I am, feeling like an asshole for making him pay rent. Honestly, if he would've tried to set something up in the beginning about pay half-rent or whatever I would've been open to it.\nShould I feel like an asshole? Should I maybe throw him a portion of the rent back? Really seeking validation here. I 100% feel like I'm in the right here, but there are still pangs of guilt.\nWould like to hear your opinion on this petty issue here, Reddit.\n\n\nEdit: Guys thank you for the feedback.

    "selftext": "I live with these two girls, Charlie and Veronica. I've been friends with Veronica for about two years, I met Charlie this year. I'm not at home that often, but every time I am, I try to sit down with them, chill out, usually Veronica and I smoke weed, ect. Well I can get a little goofy whether I'm intoxicated or not, but I feel like every time I let my guard down they start taping me, but only recently did I learn they do this. \n\nVeronica knows I hate having pictures taken of me because I hate my body, ect. Charlie tends to tape lots of people. (Also when I say tape, they do it on their iphones, sometimes through snapchat, ect.) Well anyway I have told them to stop but they keep doing it. It's really embarrassing. I have never had friends who do this. I feel like when I'm with my friends, I should be able to let loose, have fun, and not worry about how people are going to judge me. Veronica says she doesn't send them to anyone but Charlie and Charlie to Veronica - but Veronica has a whole slew of these tapes in her phone. \n\nSo today, while we were having dinner, they started talking about them, and I bitched them out a bit. Now I am really fuming. i told them if they keep doing this shit, I can't be friends with them (although I didn't say this definitively or very seriously - the context was more light-hearted, but I was trying to make a point.) \n\nI am not sure if I can trust Veronica with the tapes. Once, she audiotaped one of our old roommates having sex for the second time, and it was really horrific, and she had everyone listen to it. So I feel like it's dangerous to have shit like this, even if they're just tapes of me saying stupid, silly things. Charlie hasn't really done any of this, but her boyfriend complains all the time about her taping him too.\n\nSo am I overreacting? Is this a normal thing for friends to do? I know it sounds light hearted but I'm always paranoid they're going to do it again. It's really upsetting me.\n\nEDIT: Also I know that they're doing it because they think the things I say are funny, and Veronica is doing it out of a \"love\" for me, but it still pisses me off.",

Today was a day off for kids in the school district so I went the normal speed of 50km/h. \n\nWhen I got out of my car a neighbour started walking towards my house and yelling at me because she thought I could have hit her kids who were riding bikes. So I started walking towards her so I could explain myself which I now realize may have been unnecessary. I told her I was driving the speed limit. She got very upset and accused me of always driving reckless so I tried to assure her that I was aware of children who played outside and that I wasn't going to hit them. \n\nShe started getting hostile and calling me names so I told her that she should watch her kids better. She got very angry and told me she would tell her husband next time I drove by.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later her husband is banging loudly on my door so I go outside to try to talk to him. My baby nephew was asleep and the neighbour was very noisy so I tried telling him to move away from the door because he would wake my nephew but he wouldn't listen and said he doesn't give a fuck about my nephew.  I got upset and told him to get off my property but he started getting in my face and threatening to hurt me. At this point I was ready to seriously hurt him but my brother and his friend were trying to defuse the situation and they stopped us from getting into a fight. \n\nAfterwards he pulled out his phone and took a picture of me and said that next time he saw me he would hurt me. I smiled for his picture. \n\nNow it is 5am and I can't stop thinking about the incident. I feel like maybe I should apologize tomorrow for being rude but at the same time I don't think I was in the wrong. I acted hostile towards my neighbours because they were hostile to me and I lost my temper for a moment. \n\n",

    "selftext": "So me and my girlfriend started dating in high school about 4 months before graduating. Everything was going great until the end of summer when she moved 4 hours away for school. We mutually decided that we should go for it, because she initially said that she would return to our current city to go to a university here after this year of university ends.\n\nHowever, just by what she tells me, she is very enveloped in the school in regards to clubs, activities, professional connections, and a LOT of friends. And because of all this, she never talks to me unless I initiate conversation over text. I don't know if this is a common thing among girls to just never talk to the guy first, but it's pretty ridiculous that I ALWAYS have to start conversation if we are going to actually talk.\n\nAnyways, I don't want to have to wait 4 fucking years for her to finish school just to see if this miraculously works out. Even then, she could just decide that I'm not worth keeping around and completely remove me from her life before then.\n\nI know it was kinda stupid getting into a relationship at that stage of my life, but knowing me, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself knowing I never at least gave it a shot.\n\nSo, am I that asshole for thinking it would benefit us both to end this emotionally draining relationship that I'm not enjoying?",

Lets start this off with my reasoning of why I did this and I'll try not to make this too lengthy and please excuse my bad formating. I am a 16 year old male and my mom is abuse especially when she's drunk.  This night she gets very drunk and started to blame our financial struggle on my father, the two of them had been separated for many years now.  She starts cussing at me and making fun of my last name and how I look very much like him. After I get very stressed I leave the house to get away from all the conflict and she tells me that I'm not allowed. I go to the living room to grab my wallet and my keys and I head for the door, she stands in my way and pushes me back and as I turn to go out the back sliding door she grabs my arm and digs her nails into it. At this point I am very angry and just run out and start planning for where I'm going to go. I spend the next couple hours at my friends house and when I come back she is still screaming at me and even more drunk. As I arrived she was making dinner, tacos. After she made hers she goes to the bathroom. It's not something that I do but I didn't put much thought into it, I unwrap her two tacos and put two Benadryl in each. As she comes back I just ignore her the best I can and watch TV while she eats by the table. She finishes one and when she goes to the other, she bites into one of the pills and spits out her food. She yells \"Did you put pills in my food!?\" I just tell her no and she doesn't believe me so she takes her food says \"fuck you\" and goes to her room for the night. She's asleep now.

    "selftext": "I work retail for a small company, nothing you would have heard of. I've worked for the company for about five months, and in that time, my location's sales have skyrocketed. I've been promoted to manager (a promotion in title only, i don't really do much authoritative stuff), and I've been offered additional promotions. I've turned them down due to other circumstances (namely a lack of transportation), but all of this is to illustrate that my boss has good reason to like me and keep me happy as an employee.\n\nLast week, he showed up at my location on a day when i wasn't working and dropped off an ipad for \"me/the store.\" As far as i can tell, it's for me, and I'm welcome to use it for research at the store, but it's really mine. He said it was a gift because i was doing so well with sales, and to help encourage me to keep it up. Not unheard of, and i was thrilled to hear about it.\n\nI dropped by the store to pick it up, and my excitement...faltered. it's an old ipad 2, which is swiftly becoming outdated/obsolete. It's refurbished, which i don't really have a problem with, but...it's broken. There's a massive dent in one corner which prevents the glass from sitting properly in the frame, so dust gets underneath the screen and generally fucks things up. The home button also doesn't work. Fortunately, i know how to fix all of these things, and i have the resources to do so. I'm just a little miffed that he gifted me a broken device. I don't know if he *knew* it was broken and knew I could fix it, or if he just didn't check it out before he gave it to me.\n\n**in summary**\n\nMy boss gave me a broken ipad as a \"you're awesome, keep it up\" present.\n\n**boss points:** he didn't have to give me this ipad, he did it out of generosity. He may not have known it was broken, or he may have trusted me to fix it myself. He may also have gotten the best he could afford - I'm not important enough in the company to know how much extra money there is to throw around.\n\n**my points:** it's *broken.* if this gift is a reflection of his opinion of me, I'm honestly insulted. It's an old device, bordering on useless, and it's broken. If you really cared, wouldn't you get me something nice that reflected it?\n\nI feel like an asshole for being upset, but my husband thinks I'm justified in being insulted. I'm not going to give it back or do anything like that...looking a gift horse in the mouth and whatnot. I'm going to suck it up, fix what's broken, and use it if i can. I'm just wondering if I'm right for being miffed.",

    "selftext": "Alright so here it goes, \n\nI'm 18 and a freshman in college and in the middle of September, I got an on campus work study job. I started working in the middle of a pay week so I only got about half of the pay that I would have expected, (The amount of money doesn't matter in this situation). So I set up my direct deposit having 65% going into my debit card, and 35% going into a savings account for books and other school stuff next semester. For some reason, the payroll office canceled my savings account before my first paycheck. No big deal really, I just got about $45 in my debit card and the rest came as a check in the mail a couple days later. So here's where the annoying shit starts to happen. \n\nThe day before I get payed the second time, a pay stub goes out online. When I got home I went to see how much money I was supposed to get and when I checked, it said my money was going into a credit card at a bank which I don't have an account with. My first though is that someone is committing fraud and it trying to take my money. This was at around 7 o'clock, so the bank and the payroll office were both closed and I went to bed pissed off. The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\n\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \n\n\nEdit: Ended up not calling. Figured I would just let it go cause there's not use in getting mad when it's all over.",

Can't stop thinking about it constantly. I want to play all the time! Unfortunately I can't play any time I want because it's my roommate's Xbox1 and I can only get a lot done when he's working and I'm not. Which is Thursday and Friday evening and Saturday and Sunday.  \n  \nMy mom and I[23F] are really close. We share just about everything with each other, and ate sometimes more friends than mother/daughter. I moved out in June because of my brother and dad and it was good timing for my friend/roommate who was moving out. For the first few months, I was really good about going over once a week for laundry and to watch the shows that I normally watch with her. October has been tough though. I went out of town, started a new job (in addition to my 9-5), was helping with my best friends wedding, and, of course, playing Destiny. I haven't been over in at least a few weeks.  \n  \nTHE INCIDENT IN QUESTION: The new hard mode raid came out recently and I've been trying so hard to beat it. This is my first fps so I'm not very good. I've had a friend who has very patiently been helping me get through it, but we still get people who rage quit because I keep dying,which I take very personally. I played a few hours on the raid Thursday and Friday and was planning on beating it yesterday, thinking I had 4 hours til my roommate got home and might jump on Halo. We originally had plans to play scary games with our other friend and drink and have a good dinner as well. Well he got home and I still wasn't done. He was totally ok with it though. I'm 4 hours in at that point, stressed/tense as hell, feeling like it's totally my fault we're not being successful and really tired too. We're trying to beat the final boss and I had just died and we wiped to start it over when there's a knock on the door. It was my parents. No call or text warning. If it was any other time, I'd have been happy to see them. But I was like a deer stuck in headlights. I didn't know what to do. I told my group to hold on a sec and someone bounced. I was so torn i was about to cry. I'm 6 hours in and so dedicated to just getting it over with.  \n  \nMy mom said that it was fine! They thought about calling and realized at that point that they should have. At that point they left.  \n  \nThen today I figured since I didn't have plans, I'd go do laundry there and hang out. My mom didn't answer her phone so I called my dad and he said my mom was sleeping but come on over for laundry. I get there and go see my mom and she looks sad and tired. Come to find out she hasn't gotten out of bed all day because she hasn't stopped crying about last night. She said she wanted to surprise me last night and thought I'd be really happy to see her, but that I looked \"disgusted\" that they showed up. She said she didn't say she was upset the night before because she didn't want to make a scene. She had expectations (hang out, see my place cuz she hasn't been there in a while, have me take a picture of them in their costumes), and was devastated that I disappointed her because I've never been the source of that kind negative feelings for her.  \n  \nIs this just a fucked up situation where we both should have done something different? Am I the asshole for not telling my team that I had to go so I could spend a bit of Halloween with my parents after they came over unannounced? Thanks for any input.  \n  \nEdit: I was told it would be pertinent to include that they showed up after 11pm.",

On top of that, a huge passion of mine is powerlifting, and the only time I can make it to the gym with my training partner is 6am.

    "selftext": "Alright, a bit of context.\n\nSo in early June my parents split up due to my dad being unfaithful to my mom. My dad very obviously regretted what he did and missed his family so he was desperately trying to reconnect with all of us as my mom wanted to cut him out of our life for a little while. As I understand the situation, my dad scheduled a family trip for two weeks to Mexico over Christmas break, including New Year's because it was a family tradition of ours, and because of this, my mom was actually mostly okay with it. I however, am not. Firstly, I am really just not comfortable with the situation. My parents are effectively going to pretend we are a happy family at our loss and just make things very awkward for us. Secondly, I am very Canadian, and I adore the cold and absolutely can't stand the heat. I am also deathly afraid of the Ocean (like, the sound of crashing waves has given me a panic attack before) and as such I get very little out of the Mexico trips. I have always been able to tolerate a week as there are some things for me to do but over a two week period I feel as if I will run out of things to do fast.\n\nI am also very frustrated because this is my first ever New Year's Eve of High School and I don't want to spend it thousands of kilometers away from my friends faking a smile through a canned celebration. I told my mom all of this and she was very angry with me, saying that she and my dad decided that we were going to do this as a family and that I was being ungrateful, and I honestly feel like I'm pretty justified in my position. Sorry for the wall of text. AITA?\n\n**TL;DR:** Parents split up early last summer, estranged dad schedules a family trip to try and get what he had back, parents are behind it, I am not for a multitude of reasons. Explain this to my mom, my mom says that I'm ungrateful and that I am going and that's final.\n\n",

Turns out the bags were too heavy for her to carry home and she wanted to leave them in the shop until the next day, but the guy from the shop didn't let her. She was so distraught, that I told her I lived nearby and I could keep her bags overnight. She was very happy and grateful. She asked me if I could cook the eggs that were in the bag and perhaps buy her some cheap macaroni and cook it too, since she didn't have gas or electricity. Sure, I can do that.\nNow, today. I cooked the eggs and macaroni as promised. The lady did show up. But when I handed her the bags, she said she'd get them \"next time\". I asked her to come in and have a seat, she  asked if I minded if she ate some of the macaroni now. I didn't mind. But, when we were talking, it became clear that she has a more long-term arrangement in mind. She wanted me to give her my schedule, so that she'd know when to come, and I would cook her eggs and macaroni (sorry that it keeps repeating, but apparently that's all she could eat) and she'd visit a few times a week and pick them up. \n\nAnd here's my problem: I really don't want to do that.\n\nI'm a cynical person, but the lady does not seem to be a scammer to me. I don't know if all she is telling me is true (about her illness, about lack of electricity and gas, that when she met me she hadn't eaten for days and so on) but she's definitely...well, old and not very healthy because of that. She's really nice and I don't get any shady vibes from her. She insists to give me money for everything and offers to share her food with me, her clothes suggest that she's poor, but she's not dirty or smelly or anything like that. She's very grateful and sweet and generally seems like a nice person.\n\nBut. I really don't want her to come regularly. In fact, I don't want her to come at all. I was happy to help then, but, and I'm cringing as I write this, I'm not a charity and I didn't sign up for this and I really don't feel up to doing stuff for her on a daily basis. I know it's a weak excuse, but I've just emerged from depression, even though I'm still on the brink of it, I can't even deal with my everyday uneventful life, and the thought of having this responsibility is too much for me. And I know it sounds stupid, calling this a \"responsibility\", but not so long ago I would eat nothing all day because even making myself a sandwich was too overwhelming. And I'm afraid that the lady will ask me for more and more things to do for her :/ \n\nSo yeah, that's it, if you have any questions, I can provide details (although I'm going to sleep soon, so there may be a few hours of delay). Also, this may be relevant: my doctor says I have enormous guilt issues (that is, I feel guilty for everything) so if my reasoning seems weird to you, this may be the cause.",

    "selftext": "For some background, my husband and I will finally be living together as of this December, following 2 years of long distance. Last year we spent Christmas together with my Mom at her house. His family lives pretty far away, but he spent the days leading up to, and the days following with his family. \n\nIn my ideal world, we'd take turns doing Christmas with his family and then with mine, so it is technically his family's turn this year. However my family is a shit show, which complicates matters. \n\nMy Dad thankfully can spend it with two of his other daughters, so I dont worry about him. However, I am essentially my Mom's only child, since my full sister hasn't spoken to my mom in about 10 years. She is also a pretty big loner, so if I dont spend Christmas with her she will be totally alone. Not my fault, but none the less something I have to deal with.\n\nI just told my husband that I'd like to spend Christmas with my Mom and New Years with him and his family. He can come with me if he wants, but if he wants to go see his family then I totally support that. He full on freaked out. He thinks my Mom is manipulative and he thinks that its her fault that she is alone. He also thinks she's been behaving particularly badly lately, so he's not exactly sympathetic to her.\n\nI've tried to somehow please all people but my Mom doesn't want to spend Christmas at his family's house, so that's out. No one else can spend Christmas with my Mom.\n\nThe logistics also make it very challenging. I only get Christmas day off, so I'd fly on Christmas Eve and then fly back 3 days later. Flights are incredibly expensive, which is just depressing.\n\nAITA for choosing to spend Christmas with my Mom so she isn't alone, and in doing so choosing her over my husband?\n\n**Update:**\nThanks for the honest comments. Its really helpful to have an unbiased audience bc my husband and mom kid of butt heads, often putting me in an awkward place. Both seem to think I am being ridiculous, and I feel pulled in 100 directions unable to decide which is fair and right.\n\nI just called my mom and it went as expected... She said that after the way I handled our wedding (explained below) a few months ago she is not surprised that I would change my mind and decide to go to my husbands family. So essentially she is as pissed off/hurt as I thought she'd be. I pray that this isn't the final nail in the coffin of our relationship. It was already pretty fragile.\n\nMy mom said that the last 20 years were a waste and that she started thinking after our wedding. she said she is removing photographs of our family, and generally just disconnecting herself from 'family'. I told her that it is only fair to take turns and she agreed, but somehow still said that she's not surprised that I've hurt her once more.\n\nThe wedding - She maintains that she wasn't involved in the planning of our wedding reception and that his family was. It was in their home town, but it was also the place where my husband and I started dating and lived for 3 years. To make matters worse, I had about 10 family members and home town friends, while he had about 30-40 family members and hometown friends. So yes, it was very lop-sided. But in all honestly, I just planned the damn thing by myself. I am a loner (wonder where I get that from) and since my husband wasn't into the details, I just did all the planning myself - they had very little involvement as well. It was a destination wedding of sorts, so I couldn't actually meet any of the suppliers and it was all done online. I couldn't exactly take her to pick out the menu and cake with me when I did it all via emails. Additionally, my mom was also incredibly mad that I invited the sister that no longer talks to her. I don't really talk to this sister, and I blame her for their falling out But if i had to do it all over again, I'd probably still invite her.",

I talked to him in person after he got it out of me through text that i have been really depressed and needed time alone. sometimes he gets too rough with me or takes jokes too far. our one year is in a month. i finally showed him that it had more to do with me than the relationship, and that it's confusing when breaking up happens and it's no ones fault. I want the break to better myself and become more independent, but also because I've been developing feelings for someone else, but thats complicated as well. she doesn't feel the same way as i do with her, but i still think it'd be crappy to have feeling towards someone while i'm dating someone else, id say its pretty much cheating, and i know if someone i was committed to was doing that to me, id be pissed. plus the day i brought up the break to my boyfriend, this girl and i cuddled in my bed and talked about life and i felt like i was betraying him the whole time, i know i was, but i havent told him about it. i havent hung out with the girl since, but that doesnt mean i dont have feelings for her anymore. he started cutting himself again, but if i tell him this, he'll get worse.\nthere are other factors in the break, like how he has more than once said that he doesn't believe my sexuality (which is so hurtful and frusturating) and that he doesn't support all of my views as a feminist and an activist.\nin my eyes, you either stay together forever or break up. and right now im between the two, they're both terrifying. i know if i dont break up right now something will happen in the future thats more hurtful than this. i never want to cheat on him EVER. but i feel like thats what would happen if i tried to be with him and only him at this time in my life. (he's against open relationships.)\nside note im suicidal and i feel like i might be preparing him for if i ever go through with it. ive been self harming too, but its my first time.\nthere are so many factors to why i feel like i need this break but i know im hurting him and i hate to be doing that. hes a great person and we were good for eachother and this was all sudden and random for him. its not fair at all to him, and i really hate that im doing this, but i feel like its necessary, like, would you want to date me after hearing what i did with that girl? thats rhetorical but i wouldnt.\nhes coming in a week to see if i still need more time alone, and if i do, he said thatd be it for us because he shouldnt have to wait around for me, which i agree with. \nam i just being stupid? or should i live my life? or should i own up and see that he needs help right now? i have no idea how to make this better and i only have a week to find out.",

    "selftext": "A little back story\u2026. My mom was born in the Dominican Republic. She grew up in a relatively poor family of farmers. In 1984, she came to the states to pursue a better life for herself and her four younger brothers. When she came here, despite English not being her first language, managed to complete high school in 3 years. She did later attempt to attend college and managed to complete three semesters. However, college did not come without a hefty price. College was too expensive for her while she assisted her parents and her younger brothers in paying the bills. It was a luxury she simply couldn\u2019t afford.\nNot having a college degree in today\u2019s day and age can\u2019t get you far, as we all know. Before the time she enrolled, she was laid off. She figured getting a college degree would help her chances of finding a new job [she found one, but not as good as the last one.] We enrolled, at different colleges, around the same time\u2026.. And that\u2019s when the conflicts started. Like I said, English isn\u2019t her first language. She can speak and read it well enough, but god forbid she needs to write something down. So that\u2019s where I come in. And holy fuck, can the timing be bad. I has to constantly write her papers when I also had my own papers to write. It was tough, but she\u2019s my mom, so I sucked it up. Although, last semester she needed me to write her a 7 page essay that was due the same week as finals\u2019 week. (Required a lot of time consuming research). Granted, I did it. And I still managed to ace my courses. But my god, was I stressed and exhausted. That was a rough week. And I was kind of furious because it almost compromised my chances of passing my classes. I told her, after that week, that I can only help her so much now, since my courses are getting more and more difficult and I need to devote more time to them. She told me she understands, and will lessen the requests.\nFast forward to this week, I have two very big midterms. If I fuck up on these tests, I just literally wasted my entire semester. So I\u2019m in hardcore study mode. Fuck my friends, fuck my family, fuck my life. I NEED to pass these tests. And, of course, my mom has an essay due on the day of one of the tests. It\u2019s also a big part of her grade. Due to my situation, I simply flat-out said no. \nMe: \u201cMom, I really want to help you, I do. But I cannot afford to fail these tests.\u201d\nMom: \u201cPlease [Jonastty], I really need this too. Can\u2019t you squeeze it into your schedule? You\u2019re better at this than I am. It\u2019ll only take you a couple hours.\u201d\nMe: \u201cMom, these are hours I can\u2019t afford to waste. I want to help you, but I can\u2019t put my grades at risk. You\u2019re asking me to choose between my future and yours.\u201d\nSo, I didn\u2019t do it. I just refused to do her paper.\nMom: \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible son! I work my ass off to support you!\u201d [She does. It\u2019s just her and I. She\u2019s a single mom and one of the hardest working people I know. We struggle to get by, but we manage.] \u201cAnd you can\u2019t even do this for me?!\u201d\nMe: \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t do it. I need you to understand that I have my own things to do.\u201d\nShe angry, I\u2019m angry. We are all angry. We haven\u2019t spoken all day. I don\u2019t know, I feel terrible that I can\u2019t finish her paper, but at the same time, I can\u2019t compromise my own grades for her own. Am I the Asshole for not doing her paper?\n\nEDIT: I should mention that, while yes, the schools offers her support. But she is a single mom who has a full time job. She is also a landlady who owns two homes that she needs to maintain. She simply doesn't have enough time to take advantage of these resources or frankly to do the work on time.",

At first I was excited about it and even really liked it. But then he told me that it was mine if l wanted it, my other option being to buy my own car. \n\nNormally would be fine even happy about this, but my parents have given my brother 3 cars. So about when my older brother was my age our great grandmother died, my mother inherited her car and my brother received it for Christmas. believe that it was an older Honda Accord but still a decent enough vehicle. Eventually after a few years he ended up totaling that car. Next there was some Saturn four door, another $2000 car. After only 2-3 months the transmission blew on it. Finally they got him some $2000 average sedan (probably another Honda). \n\nSo in the last 5 years or so my parents have or more in Cars. We're a part of the upper middle class and live in a nice enough neighborhood if that is important at all.) My brother and my dad used to fight ALOT and my brothers grades gradually declined throughout high school and he smoked a lot of weed.

    "selftext": "Alright. Let's say my name is Josh. Make it easy. I'm 16 for reference and a junior in high school.\n\nSo this happened tonight. I texted my friend - let's call him Nate - asking if he wanted to hang out. Sure, and he proposes that we go hang out with my ex - who we'll call Abby - and her friend - Jane works. I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\n\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\n\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\n\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\n\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\n\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\n\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\n\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\n\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\n\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \n\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\n\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\n\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left. Now Nate, Abby, and Jane all are calling me an asshole for causing Abby to get a ticket.\n\n\nSo am an asshole for leaving my friend after a crappy night for me, and then being a part of the reason she got a ticket?",

For example, if someone asks me why I look so tired, the answer might be that before going to bed, I spilled a huge mug of tea behind my counter and I spent half the night taking my kitchen apart and trying to soak up the moisture. But it's easier to just say \"I didn't sleep well\".\n\nWhen I'm late because I spent too much time on reddit and forgot that I still had to take a shower, I will say that I took the wrong train because I feel like that's somehow more excusable.

It's supposed to be practice for building up my public speaking/interaction skills.\n\nAnyhow, I ended up hesitating at nearly every opportunity to do my job, especially after I made a major fuck-up in charging a speaker's guests for parking. If I waited just a split second, my friend's wife would jump in and do it. So she ended up doing just about everything.\n\nAfter we'd finished the main part of the job, I mentioned to her that I wished I had done more. And she sort of told me \"Well that's the job, just smiling and letting people in. You hate it, right?\" I didn't really, I just felt like a fucking cunt. So I rephrased what I'd just said, and she told me that she didn't need my help if I hated it. I don't argue unless I'm absolutely being fucked over, so I just agreed and shut up.\n\nThen she sent me downstairs with my friend (the husband) to spend the rest of the event. Yesterday he messages me over Facebook and tells me that he'd prefer that I act like a grownup (I mean I'm 20, so partially there at least, and from a shitass household &amp; social situation that constantly insulted me my entire childhood, I've told him this) and stop whining and complaining when he sends me to help with stuff, especially involving his wife. I tested the waters, stating that I'd like the job better described to me beforehand next time. He says that I should just shut up and take advice like a grownup (btw literally the word he used) and do better next time. Once again I just shut up, because pitting myself against a wife never ends well.\n\nI will admit I complain probably significantly more than other people, it's one of the few ways I get relief from stress, if a shitty one.

Jessica tells me that should work because the rest of the night she is going to the mall with friends and getting dinner with her family. I also text her wishing her a happy birthday and give her a heads up that we will play tomorrow by ear because I will most likely be to exhausted to hang out. That night I purposely get to bed early with the intention to be rested enough to hang out Jessica. The whole night I was tossing and turning because I was so anxious about the SAT and making the day special for Jessica. \n\nSaturday morning I'm up bright and early at 7 AM and head over to the testing center. I text Jessica one more time wishing her a happy birthday and that I will text her once I finish the test. Overall the SAT took about 5 hours with the breaks we got in between sections. The test officially ended at 12:50 PM and I was completely exhausted so I got in my car and drove home. At 1 PM as I was about to text Jessica she texts me asking what the plan is. I text her back telling her that I am way to tired to hang out with her and that I need to go home and take a nap. She seems a little disappointed (which is understandable) and I text her back that I'm super sorry and that we can do something special tomorrow (she was busy the rest of the day). Jessica wasn't agreeing to hang out on a different day and eventually she stops responding to my texts.\n\nLate Saturday night (like 11 PM) she texts me out of the blue asking if she can rant to me. I tell her yes and then she proceeds to write me a number of essays about how pissed off she is at me. She complains to me about how I \"blew her off on her birthday\" and that I \"was probably hanging out with other people anyways.\" She also goes off on me about how it didn't seem like I cared. The first time she texted me I responded saying how I am sorry and that if we hung out I feel like I wouldn't have been able to make the day special for her and stuff. She keeps texting me and isn't accepting my apology so eventually I stop saying I'm sorry and I try to explain my side to her. I genuinely didn't do anything except go home, put on the TV, and fall asleep after the SAT. She kept accusing me of not caring and I eventually just tell her we need to hang out tomorrow and work it out in person.\n\nSunday comes around (the day she was very adamant about being to busy to hang out on) and we go out and get food at Panera. The whole time it was kind of awkward and we were just making small talk. As I am driving her back to her house, I tell Jessica that we should probably break up. I explain to her that I really enjoy spending time with her but I don't think it's working out. She agrees and I tell her that I hope we can still be friends. She seemed very content with the situation and she didn't freak out or get mad at me. I thought we ended the relationship on pretty good terms and I thought I handled the situation pretty maturely.\n\nOn Thanksgiving I wake up and she a text on my phone from Jessica. She said: **\"Happy Thanksgiving!! So thankful we broke up omfg\"** \n\nAs soon as I read that text I got extremely pissed off and headed straight for the gym. Haven't texted her back or contacted her in anyway. So Reddit-- Am I an asshole for not hanging out with my girlfriend on her birthday?",

She felt like she couldn't even move that day because of how horrible she felt. \n\nLater on, she asked me if I would go to the funeral with her, even though it's far away. I said of course I would, I want to be there to support her. \n\nSo I tell my mom while I'm driving her to work that I'm going to be gone friday and be back sunday. She immediately reminds me that my cousins have a dance recital over the weekend, and I'm being a little selfish for not going to see them, because \"you have a family, too.\" \n\nSo I kind of just sit there not sure what to say. I told her I love my cousins and I love watching them do what they do well, but that I think a person dying is more important than a dance. Then she says if I HAVE to go, I need to at least find them presents while I'm out of town. Something cooky and crazy they couldn't find at home, because she's sure we'll come across lots of weird stores.\n\nI just sat there in silence. I got so fucking mad over that. The fact that 1) she did not really react much to my girlfriend's father's death beyond \"oh. that sucks. i'm sorry for her,\" and 2) she makes it seem like I'm going on a fucking road trip! This is not going to be a fun trip! I'm not going to shop all weekend, I'm going to support my girlfriend while she mourns her dead father. \n\nAnd when she realized that I was a little pissed with her, she got mad with me. She started getting really passive aggressive and treating me like I was being irrational about the whole thing. \n\nBut am I the asshole for not wanting to get my cousins gifts while I'm away?",

This is okay because usually if I want to use it he's receptive and will let me use the stereo or TV. Sometimes not so much but not enough for it to be an issue. He also does not have a drivers license so this requires me to take him home, to the gym, the store, etc. Usually I don't mind but sometimes I do have to conform to his schedule to do this.

Well my best friend has been doing just that with his ex and his wife. Several times he\u2019s made me claim that he was hanging out with me when in fact he was over his ex\u2019s house. His wife is not stupid and can tell that he\u2019s lying but she trusts me enough that when I say that he\u2019s with me she believes it. The marriage is falling apart and has been since the beginning. They went from meeting to engaged to pregnant to married in the space of about 2 months and every step of the way I was urging them to slow down. At this point they hate each other and are both miserable and there exists no trust. That being said she, at least seems, to be trying a tiny bit harder. \n\nWell he\u2019s still in love with his ex (who also happens to be the mother of his first child) and is biding his time before he leaves his wife for her. At this point he admits that he\u2019s only around to help take care of the new born but will be leaving very soon. He\u2019ll still help take care of her and will seek split custody. \n\nOk so the other night he\u2019d gotten me to lie again that we were running an errand while he really went to see her again and \u201cTalk\u201d. Later when I went to pick him up from her house I told him that I did not want to help with that anymore. I don\u2019t want to lie for him, I don\u2019t want to drive him to her house I don\u2019t even want to know what\u2019s happening. I may not respect either of them anymore but I need to try to regain some of the self-respect I lost while helping him. \n\nWell he lashed out and said that I was going against the \u201cBro Code\u201d that if I was really his best friend I\u2019d want to help him be happy. That I helped for this long why stop now? I told him that I do want him to be happy and I understand that the ex is who will do that but he\u2019s not going about this the right way. It ended with him saying \u201cFine, I\u2019ll just get Tom to help me\u201d. \n",

We sent it around to a few test subjects, including several strangers, all of whom had very positive responses to it. I sent it to my boyfriend as well, and he laughed louder than almost anyone else. My boyfriend, my friend, and I then ended up at dinner together, and I was preparing to upload the video to my website. My boyfriend was acting play-annoyed at me, because I asked him \"Do you like it? Do you like it?\" over and over (also as a joke), and he, of course, kept responding yes. Then, my friend mentioned something about how we needed to know if my bf \"liked it or loved it,\" because we'd only put it up if he loved it (this was also a joke on the part of my friend). So, I asked in the same playful tone, \"Do you love it?\" And my boyfriend tensed up, started acting really uncomfortable, and said \"I... really like it.\" I could tell this wasn't a joke, but to avoid embarrassment for the both of us, I laughed it off like it was one just in front of my friend.\n\nWhen she left, I asked him why he didn't say he loved it. He responded that he just doesn't usually describe things with that particular wording. This was news to me--he's often excessively affectionate, we've been together for 3.5 years, and he actually told me he loved me on our first date. I tried to tease the answer out of him, but he really seemed uncomfortable with the very prospect of saying it, and couldn't really explain to me why, so I stopped. I am, however, a little confused, and a little hurt. He does game design, and I'm constantly telling him how much I love his work--my Facebook is plastered with articles and links about him, so I know I've used the word \"love\" specifically several times to describe it. I wish he would say the same for me and mine. I know actions speak louder than words, yadda yadda yadda, but this particular word matters a lot to me, especially because my work is something that I consider very personal and, however cheesy it is, an extension of myself. We've talked about this extensively tonight, but right now he and I are just kind of at an impasse. He doesn't understand why I care so much about him saying it, I don't understand why he doesn't want to say it (and there's a part of me that doesn't understand why he's so adamant not to say it when he knows it'll make me happy if he says it at all, even if he's lying).

I am concerned about my parents not retiring, but otherwise, I look at it as none of my business. My parents do a ton for my kids, which I am very grateful for and that as my kids are my world.\n\nAnyways, my mom made it a point to sit down with me and have me pick out some stuff I would like for Christmas. I picked out a few things, including these really pretty long scarfs. She asked if I thought my sister would like them, but both agreed they weren't her style. When they came in, my mom showed me because they were even nicer than we imagined. Yesterday, she calls and says she worries my gifts look like more than my sister's even though she is getting my sister a washing machine. She asks if she can give her one of my gifts. I say sure. Then she tells me she wants to give her one of my two scarfs. I am taken back by this. I was really excited for these, hand picked them and my sister will never wear them and I will. \n\nIt hit a nerve. My sister was always the favorite growing up and my parents had no issue taking from me to give to her. My grandpa (who has since passed) used to hate it and would get me stuff that my sister stole from me if it was something I loved/needed (this happened a few times).

I did tell her it bothered me and she agreed not to do it.\n\nI feel like I was acting like a spoiled brat. I have so much and I am very fortunate. This just brough up a lot of issues for me. It really hurt. She knew I was excited for these to the point I was planning on wearing them as soon as I unwrapped them on Christmas morning as part of my outfit. I don't care if she gives my sister all my other gifts, I just wanted this one thing. It felt like she cares more about my sister because she worries about appearing fair.

I put flex hours (can work most times) but they needed me in graveyard - I was cool with it. \n\nSo like two shifts in I'm already noticing there's a completely lack of professional behavior on both sides of the ball (customer service and employee relationships). It all started on our first night - my coworker made a, albeit consequential, mistake. One of the \"senior staffers\" (old fucks who have been cashiering at this gas station for years) took it upon herself to rip this poor girl a new one. The second night ended with me discovering a coworker photographed a simple mistake I made and \"reported\" my shit via messaging group: a group I'm not even in, mind you.\n\nI decided to call my manager to speak to him about what I'd been seeing. He practically dodged me, forcing me to ask him things over the phone. Didn't go well.\n\nIt all culminated to the end of my 4th shift. The shift relieving me and my partner cannot open because there aren't enough dollar bills in the tills.

Going into this, I thought the price was 650 for each room (that's what I was told by a roommate.) The day I signed it was 700. I felt pressured to sign it, and I'd already picked my room. I thought the largest room was 675, mine and other two at 650, and the smallest at 625. So basically I feel totally gipped.

My fondest Christmas memories have been getting things on the top of my list, even if they weren't at all expensive. On the other hand, gifts from aunts and uncles tended to be more expensive but less heartwarming, like a controller that I haven't used once in years, and duplicates of things I already have like MP3 players. I felt grateful that they spent so much money, but sad that I couldn't really enjoy it as much as they wanted to.\n\n\nI'm completely opposed to the idea that you're supposed to telepathically know what your SO wants for Christmas (or anyone, for that matter). It's especially hard since my girlfriend and I don't share very many hobbies: she's not a gamer, she already has all the music and movies that she wants (and her tastes are different than mine), she doesn't read for pleasure often, and she's already seen Star Wars. She's under the impression that it's supposed to be a surprise, and it's fine if I don't want it to be for me, but she wants it to be for her. I told her that I really, honestly didn't know what to get her, and jokingly said \"I might end up getting something you don't want, like a vacuum or a sexy maid outfit\".

    "selftext": "TL;DR my partner is upset with me because I won't watch the newest star wars movie with him. I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\n\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\n\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\n\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\n\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\n\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\n\nI'm thinking of the following options: \n\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\n\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain. This will essentially be bottling my emotions up though and he and I have always sworn to have a communicative relationship.",

But rather than walk to the garbage and gag it out of me, I beat myself to the gag and just lean over my dad sitting near\nMe, opened my mouth, and let it all just fall out and onto his shirt.\n\nMy dad flipped a fucking shit at me. Just starts with this whole attitude of how disgusting it is that I would just spit out my food on someone and how unfunny that was and just disgusted with me and completely killed the fun mood they were having at my expense. \n\nI have been home for less than 3 hours and I already can't wait for\nthe week to end so I can go back to where I live now.\n\nI honestly don't care if I'm an asshole or not. I don't regret what I did. But I am a bit curious what other people think. To my dad and my brother I'm the asshole.

Will answer questions if anyone has them. Thanks\n\nOh before this gets replies, it ended up being some combo of friend chicken and sweet potatoes according to my dad, so it really wasn't just dog food. I was just really disgusted when I was just told it was dog food.\n\n*edit*: I'm totally fine being the asshole, but why downvote someone for being the asshole?

So, whenever I go to my grandpas, the neighbors come over too. They've got two 13 year old kids who constantly annoy everyone not just talking a lot of crap about everyone but taking food, phones. So, everyone in my extended family will talk bad about them even if they go into the house for 3 seconds someone will say something bad. \n\nAnyways, yestreday they kept taking my phone and just being completely obnoxious even to my little cousin who is 5 but doesn't know better.

    "selftext": "I'm using a throwaway for various reasons. So, with a little bit of backstory, I'm from the UK, am 17, am an only child and currently live with my parents. My parents tend to go out a lot of the time and sometimes leave me alone frequently. They leave me things to cook for myself if they're not going to be there the whole day/night. However, most of the time I have to cook myself something (usually rice and fish fingers or something like that) and resort to snacking alot as a result of not having much food in the house.\n\nSo today I've been at home with my Dad doing some school work and playing some games while my Mum's been out the whole day with one of her friends. This evening my dad's gone out to the pub and to a restaurant with his friends while my mum has gone out with her friends too. They also went out last night to a friends house and I had to make something for myself as usual. I was a little mad at them and told my Dad that I wanted a fully cooked meal but he told me to just have leftover food from Christmas. I asked him if we could go to Mcdonalds or something because it would have at least filled me up. He told me he would only go to get one if I paid for it.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for getting mad at my parents that they won't pay for me to have takeaway food or at least make me something themselves? I'm not really sure if I'm overreacting at all or they're genuinely in the wrong. ",

    "selftext": "OK so my roommate Billy and I moved into an apartment last April. When we moved in, the agreement was that we would split the cost of furnishing the apartment, as we only had furniture for our rooms, and the living room was empty, with bare walls throughout the house. We wouldn't necessarily split the costs of the items, but we'd each buy things that build a good living space together.\n\nThe idea here was that we both now have a good paying jobs, and don't need to live in dingy places anymore, so we would get some nice stuff.\n\nWhen we moved in one of the rooms was bigger so I agreed to pay an extra $40/mo. for it. Making rent $360 &amp;amp; $320, respectively. \n\nWe also have a 3rd roommate, Jack who lives in a tiny room for $220.\n\nSo a few months go by, and I had been asking Billy to throw in with me on a TV or to come with me to get furniture or to maybe get some things to put on the walls, but Billy always said he had no money to spare, so I waited for a few more months.\n\nAfter about eight months go by, I got tired of waiting and just went and bought all the furniture for the house - including a 55 inch flat screen, a tv stand, end tables, coffee table, 6 or 7 nice, large wall decorations, Apple TV, and other miscellaneous things for the apartment. (To be fair, Billy bought a 1st gen Wii and a blu ray player.)\n\nBilly now loves hanging out in the living room, does it all the time, and everyone who comes over compliments on it. \n\nBut here comes the tricky part: we're moving next year.\n\nIn our new place there will inevitably be a master bedroom. \n\nMy logic is that, considering that I have furnished our entire apartment by myself, (and some extra because we are moving to a house next year) - I should get the master bedroom and the rent should be divided equally.\n\nRoommate says that it's bullshit, but I think it's only fair because I'll be furnishing the whole place!\n\n(Our 3rd roommate Jack agrees, and is going to split rent equally.)\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n[UPDATE] \nI spoke with Billy and cited some of the reasoning I found from some of the comments in this thread. \n\nBasically he wants to save up to buy a house, but that will take him a few years. If he doesn't live with me, he'll have to find another set of roommates, buy furniture, and he will probably end up paying ALOT more. \n\nAfter hearing this, I told him that he had 2 choices: live with me and split the rent, or find a different living situation. I told him not to give me an answer but to wait a week and consider both options, but even he agreed that living with me and splitting equally will make it  easier for him to save for a house as he wont have any other expenses on top of rent and utilities. \n\nHe will give me an answer in a week and we will go from there. \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to weigh in on this.",

    "selftext": "I live in a city that's famous for tourism.  About a year ago, my cousin, her husband, and their young son visited for the first time.  They asked me for suggestions, and I gave them a list.  When they arrived, they didn't want to go to any of those places.  I ended up driving them to where they told me to go.\n\nWhat annoyed me is through later conversation, it was revealed they hadn't even researched my suggestions before rejecting them.  They didn't know what the places were.  It's not like they had very particular tastes either.  They often complain they can't do anything with a kid, ignoring the kid-friendly activities I've suggested, and spend most of their time wandering around shopping districts, while the poor kid is clearly bored out of his skull.  And they won't even take my suggestions on shopping areas.\n\nI had hoped it would be different this year, but it was exactly the same.  I go to pick them up (in a really heavy traffic tourist district), and drive them where they want to go.  They haven't even asked to see my apartment, which admittedly suits me since it's not really set up for guests.  \n\nI don't even really know why this bothers me so much, but it does.  Don't get me wrong.  They're nice people, they include me in activities, and always pay for meals.  But I feel like as a local to the city they're visiting, they should give my advice at least a little weight.  I've tried to hint at this, but would I be an asshole if I raised this complaint with them clearly?",

    "selftext": "Happy new year, reddit.\n\n\nMy new year has not been very happy.. \nTo start off, I am 18 years old and live in Australia. Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \n\n\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \n\n\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \n\n\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\n\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\n\n\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\n\n\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \n\n\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How did I know they were a couple? Because they kept touching each other and couldn't go more than a minute without kissing. I'm by no means a prude but it was not the kind of behavior that I think is ok in public. It would be different if it were in a park or something where there was a little bit of space and it was just them doing their own thing but we were all crowded into the metal tunnel thing that you walk down to board and these weren't chaste little pecks or cute kisses on the cheek. I was curious as to what had them acting that way because it was way more than just a couple whose normal level of affection was higher than is standard and I also wanted them to stop but I didn't feel like saying \"Chill the fuck out and explain to me why you can't keep your lips off each other\" would be an effective or civil option so instead I said \"Are you two newlyweds?\" and they giggled and blushed and said no and seemed to find some modicum of self-awareness because they switched to just giggling with each other and only kissed about 3 more times before we got to the airplane. I'm not against couples being happy or kissing in public, I just think that a little bit more dignity is appropriate in that situation and they were making a lot of people, including me, uncomfortable.

    "selftext": "Sorry. Long. \n\nI'm pregnant, my due date was two days ago. Family and friends are, understandably, constantly asking for updates, wanting to know if the baby has arrived yet. I'm happy to oblige with info - seeing and feeling the support network around us is comforting. But I'm also a little skittish. I grew up in an abusive family, with an extremely intrusive mother (Borderline Personality Disorder), so I'm particular about invasions of my personal space and privacy. I was raised with a skewed perspective of what is \"normal\" - how much access I owe to whom - so I'm still learning where and how to place and reinforce boundaries. Which is where you good people come in. \n\nA good friend of mine, who is aware of my upbringing, pushed me a bit too far the other day. \n\nBit more background. We moved last week. We helped to renovate the new place and are fixing up the old. My doc has been expecting me to go into labor for the past three weeks, I've been having intermittent contractions every day, we've been on continuous baby alert, which is nerve-wracking and physically taxing. I haven't been able to walk or stand for more than a few minutes for the past three months because I have SPD (pregnancy-related loosening of the pelvic bones, fairly painful stuff). The holidays were underway. We have a big dog that needs daily exercise. My SO has really stepped up, he's worked his ass off to make all of this happen before baby comes - basically alone, since I've been sidelined by the pregnancy - while working a full time job. We're in good spirits, but a LOT has been going on.\n\nMy friend is a freelancer and just finished a big project. There's now a lull in her work schedule. Her boyfriend's family is visiting for the holidays from overseas. She's a bit bored and also looking to escape her in-laws every once in a while.\n\nSo. Day one of our (two-day) move, she texts me to complain about how everything is \"too much\" and how she just broke down crying because she's under so much pressure, having to work right up until her in-laws arrive. I don't answer, because I'm lying in bed, trying to breathe through contractions and postpone labor, all while my SO and two friends are taking down and reassembling our kitchen in the new place. The next day (our big moving day), she texts me again to ask how things are going. I am cooking lunch for a dozen people who showed up to help us out, so again I don't answer. She texts a third time, now in a panic, assuming I might me in labor. We're currently carrying all of our junk into the new place, so I don't see the text. She calls me, I don't see the call. She then calls my SO, who doesn't see the call. I finally discover that she's been trying to reach me and tell her that no, I'm not in labor, I've just been very busy. Because we're moving, which she is aware of. She texts that she's going to be checking in a lot the next few days. I say I probably won't be able to answer her if I'm in labor anyway. She says \"exactly, that way I'll know\". This creeps me out. I tell her she's sweet, but that she's applying too much pressure, and that I will let her know when things start going down. \n\nA few days later, on Christmas Eve, she texts me, wanting to exchange gifts. I tell her no, there's just too much going on, I'd like to meet up after we've finished setting up the new apartment, after the holidays. She says OK and backs off for a bit. Two days later (still officially the holidays here in Europe), she texts me again, saying she has some free time and wants to stop by. I answer, again, that there's too much stuff going on and clearly state that I will let her know when we're ready for visitors. Two more days go by. She texts again. Her boyfriend's family has left town, so now they're free to help out with the move if we need anything. I say, again, thanks but we're fine, we might need help painting in a week or two but we're good till then, and AGAIN, that *I* will approach *her* when we're ready for visitors and to exchange gifts. Two days go by. She texts again. She'll be in the neighborhood that afternoon and would like to come by to exchange gifts. I don't see the text message because I'm busy as f*** building furniture and, again, breathing through contractions. When she doesn't get a reply, she just shows up at our door, boyfriend and gifts in tow. I'm shocked and pissed, but polite, and invite them in for a chat. They do us a favor and take the dog for a walk, but that really just throws us off schedule, because they stay out longer than planned and want to open gifts afterwards - I can't start any new big tasks until they come back, so I lose a lot of valuable furniture building time. We exchange gifts. It's a bit strained, but OK. \n\nRight before they leave, she lets drop that when she couldn't reach me or my SO on moving day, she started researching what hospitals are in the vicinity of our apartment, and calling them to find out if I'm registered there, and if so, whether I've gone into labor. (She knows that I made an extra effort to register privately because I'm afraid my parents will do exactly this, then show up at the hospital and make a scene.) Then I snap. I tell her (politely, no rage, though SO says he could see I was seething) that this is not OK, that it's a sensitive time and that we need more space. While they're leaving, I give her a hug so she doesn't feel too bad. \n\nI'm not sure why she's so focused on my pregnancy and birth. When she's busy, she hardly pays attention - when she's not, she gets pretty intense. She has said a number of times that she wants to see how my body has changed in the last weeks of pregnancy. (I hate that. I am not a circus attraction.) She's commented a lot about how I haven't gained too much weight, how lucky that is and also how odd she finds that to be. She has always commented on how slim I am. So my best educated guess is that she was pushing to see me while still pregnant both out of boredom and out of some sort of morbid fascination with my body. But I do also think that she genuinely wants to support us however she can - it just has to be on her terms. Which is totally OK. I may have also been too nice during all of this? Not clear and direct enough? That may have caused some confusion for her.\n\nRelevant side story: She and her boyfriend were supposed to watch our dog when I go into labor. When I found out her in-laws were coming to visit right before my due date, I had to ask if they could still take on the dog if the baby comes while they're visiting. Her response was basically: \"Oh yeah, come to think of it, I guess not, haha! If you don't find anyone else, let me know, but we really don't have time after all.\" I hate to think what would have happened if I had gone into labor without clearing that up first. But - *also* - before the move, her boyfriend spent an entire afternoon helping us build a cupboard for the kitchen, and expected nothing in return, which was awesome. He has helped us numerous times before. We usually cook them a big fancy meal as a thank you.\n\nThat evening, after the forced visit, I text her an explanation - that I understand that she's emotionally involved, and that I'm glad I have her support, but that I am not comfortable with her behavior. That forcing a visit after being told numerous times that we did not want them stopping by meant she didn't respect out boundaries, and that it made me worry about what it could be like when the baby is here. Will she disregard our wishes then too? And that calling hospitals to find out where I'm registered is intrusive. I also told her that not every woman enjoys her body being viewed and evaluated in the last weeks of pregnancy, because it's a really awkward and uncomfortable time. I ended the text on a positive note, thanking her for her help and interest, but I was still pretty direct about the whole thing. She didn't react well, and said I'm being overly critical and hypersensitive, that I've deeply hurt her feelings and created distance between us, and that all of her previous pregnant girlfriends appreciated the effort she put in. Basically: That I'm the weird one.\n\nSo. Am I pushed her away for no reason? Was her behavior normal (especially calling the hospital)? Am I overreacting? AITA?",

They constantly bitch about me and tell me to treat them like adult....yet they cant even remember to pay the bills. they are both in denial that they are irresponsible yet only seem to think i'm in the wrong. I cant just sit there and continuously take their shit because they are from money and i am not. they think everyone is less. Sometimes the way they talk to me makes me feel like the help. So am i wrong for wanting to just scream at them? I have no idea how to make them realize how ridiculous and lazy they are. They just think i'm a rude asshole. am I?",

    "selftext": "This may be a long one, so stick with me. I'm a Senior in college, set on graduating this coming spring. This incident took place in the fall semester (which just ended).\n\nOne of the final courses I had to take for my minor was Argumentation and Debate\u2014a topic which I both enjoy studying and practicing. The final was a tournament-style debate which awarded the victor and runner-up a grade of a 100%, with lower grades given to people who were knocked out quicker. Needles to say, there was an incentive to be the best. \n\nOne of the choices that needed to be made prior to the final was whether or not to disclose your topic to your competition, the benefit being that your opponent could study your topic and come up with some apt retorts. Now, the majority of my classmates chose one topic to study for the length of the class, as that's easier than having to study a new topic ever time we held a mock debate. Knowing this, I used the same topic for every mock debate except the final, thinking it would give me an edge. \n\nI showed up for the exam period well prepared, having throughly researched the topics I thought my opponents were going to have. The woman who sits next me, Aastha, greeted me as I walked into the classroom. \n\n(Some quick background on Aastha: she was also a senior, had the same minor as me, and constantly spoke of how she had \"stopped caring\" about everything college related because she was close to graduation.)\n\nAs I got situated, Aastha asked if I had received the email that she sent out to those who were debating that day. 'What email?' I inquired. Apparently she had sent an email out to make sure that everyone was going to debate topics they had been practicing the entire semester. \n\nNow, I have a VERY common name, John Smith, and there are a countless number of people who share a similar email to mine in my school's directory. I asked which email she sent it to, and\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014it was the wrong one. Happens all the time.\n\nI said it wasn't a big deal, I already knew most of the topics. She agreed, then followed up by saying she researched the topic I had been debating all semester and was \"ready for the battle.\" Then I told her I changed my topic. This visibly upset her (which Does make me feel a bit shitty). She demanded to know the new topic so that she could start researching it ASAP. I told her that I wasn't going to disclose it. She responded by shouting, \"THIS ISN'T A COMPETITION,\" to which I replied, if you think that's true, then you wont have a problem with me keeping my topic to myself. \n\nAt this point, I walked out of the room. I didn't feel like debating over the ethics of my choice, and I wasn't about to stand there and let her yell out me till class started. \n\nAs I left, I saw my professor (Prof. Hemingway) down the hall. He's a good guy. He and I have been friends since my freshman year. We chatted a bit, then headed inside the classroom. \n\nAs we walked through the door, I looked over to my seat (toward the front) and saw Aastha pulling stuff out of my backpack, looking through my papers. \n\nAastha is not my friend. I did not giver her permission to go through my things. This pissed me off.\n\nAnd in a strange coincidence, it pissed off my professor, too. He stopped her, asked her if she knew what she was doing, and she kind of smirked, put down my shit, and sat back in her seat. Prof. Hemingway gave me a 'wtf' look, I retuned it, shrugged, then sat down. We went through the debates, it was fine, I was runner up. Aastha got knocked out immediately (not by me).\n\nFollowing class, my professor pulled me aside to get the scope of what happened. I told him the exact story above, and he said that he was going to see what he could do. I figured he was going to bump ten point off her score or something. Then, the following day, I got an email saying that I was urgently needed at Dean Black's office, who runs the College of Arts and Science at my university. \n\nWhen I got there he and Prof. Hemingway had laid out several forms and looked as though they had been discussing the topic for hours. Then they laid out their opinion. \n\nYou see, my school is progressive in terms of the protection of property and privacy, and Aastha had made a big mistake. \n\nLong story short, they considered what she did not only a violation of privacy, but because I had chosen not to disclose my topic, they also considered her actions attempts at both cheating and harassing another student with the intention of aiding them in cheating. \n\nOver winter break, they took her to academic court on my behalf. Things did not turn out well for Aastha. I was forwarded the decision that the court came to. She was given a zero on the exam (but didn't fail the class), and she had my stripped of the right to walk at graduation. \n\nAnd that's where my story ends. I have a lot friends in the communication department. All of them know her. The group is split on whether or not I did the right thing in requesting that she be taken to academic court. The ones who think I overreacted now avoid me, which I get.\n\nI have mixed feelings as well. There are days where I know I did the right thing\u2014usually followed by days racked with guilt over the situation I caused. \n\nPlease tell me, am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "The one black guy in my small office (Will) is inarticulate, and he knows it.  He calls it ebonics.  The rest of us are caucasians.  He says things like \"I *brought* a dozen eggs at the store.\"  And it's obvious he means \"bought\", so anyone who tells him he should have said \"bought\" more than once is busting his balls because they want to be a grammar nazi.  Most people do this to him, but I don't.  But sometimes, he'll say something that is truly confusing, and I'll have to clarify.  The long story is below, but **TL;DR: he failed to clearly communicate something, and when I tried to clarify it, he got offended and stormed out, then blamed me later for not understanding, so I think he's an oversensitive asshole.  Does that make me the Asshole/Racist?**\n\nOne day, my boss, Mike, decides to try to sell his house.  Will knows a guy who runs a store down the street and wants to buy a house, so he suggests it, and brings the guy by to see it.  The boss isn't around, so the guy from up the street asks for a floorplan and says he wants to come back another day to look at the house.  Will calls the boss (who is now out of town), and the boss tells him to have the guy call his mobile phone, so they can discuss it.  At this point, Will tells me \"Mike wants me to have the guy call him, so I'm walking over there to tell him.  Can I have some floorplans to give him?\" I give him the plans and he goes.  \n\nWill comes back and hands me the business card for the potential buyer's store and a phone number and e-mail address written on a separate scrap paper.  He tells me the guy wasn't at his store so Will got the e-mail address from someone working there, and I need to e-mail the plans so he can see them today.  Then he said, \"He told him to call him\".  And I said \"Mike's already talked to him?\"  \"No\", Will says. \"He's gotta call\".  At this point, I have no idea what Will is trying to say, and Will seems annoyed that I already tried to clarify what he said once.  So I say \"If Mike hasn't spoken to him,  I don't understand what you mean by 'He told him to call him'.\"  Then, he says \"Nevermind, I'll do it myself.\" grabs the paper he just gave me, and begins to storm out.  (He doesn't have a scanner or the plan files, so he won't be able to do it himself.)  I tell him not to be so dramatic, because I'm happy to send the e-mail.  So he puts the paper with the e-mail address back down on my desk, and I ask what he means by \"He told him to call him.\" and he storms out, leaving the paper on my desk.  So, I sent an e-mail with the floorplans to the potential buyer saying, \"Will asked me to send you these plans for the house\".  \n\nA day later, no one has responded to the e-mail, or called the boss, and Will comes in to ask me why we didn't get a call.  Apparently, he never left any messages at the store.  He just got the phone number and e-mail address, and expected me to tell the guy to call our boss.  Apparently, this is what the phrase \"He told him to tell him to call\" was meant to convey to me.  I think he totally failed to communicate that, and when I tried to clarify what he was saying, he threw a hissyfit and left.  Am I an asshole for thinking he's being a bitch, and it's his fault, not mine, that the job never got done?",

I was driving in the left lane to make a left hand turn at the next set lights and after turning this other driver has made his way though the traffic and is now tailgating me. I decide to change lanes to let him past and the moment he is past change lanes back and pull right up his ass (I don't make the best decisions at 5am). He speeds up to pull away and I just keep up with him right behind, we carry on like this for about a minute getting up to double the speed limit. Now I travel this road daily for 9 years so know it very well, I know we are coming up to a bend which has a really big pothole on the left in the lane we are driving in, right before we get there I brake hard and he actually accelerates into the bend, hits the pothole which is hard to negotiate at the speed limit and his car gets a little bit of air and bounces but because we are in the bend he is now heading into the other lane so tries to correct it but over steers and sends the car sideways before the rear hits the concrete barrier in the middle of the road, bounces off that and the front hits the metal barrier on the edge of the road and bounces off that and goes sideways back into the concrete barrier, I think he spun around three to four times and comes to rest across both lanes blocking all traffic.\n\nWe (there was a co-worker in the car with me, we have never spoken about it since) stop and check if the guy is alright, his airbag went off, bits of his car are scattered all over the place and smoke is pouring out of his car, not just from under the hood but its inside the car coming out from under the dash and around the gear stick, he was dazed and looked a little roughed up but not serious injured, we pulled him out and sat him on the sidewalk, by this time about ten cars are stopped behind us, mostly people he has been tailgating, a small group of us push his car around the corner off the main road and nobody has a problem with driving off and leaving old mate sitting on the sidewalk and his car f**ked up around the corner.\n\n\nAm I an asshole or the people's champion?\n\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify a few things after reading some of the comments. Firstly the guy was fine, I am aware you shouldn't more accident victims as you can do further damage, he got out of the car himself but was just staring in the road muttering to himself, we just moved him to the sidewalk as he was dazed, secondly I didn't plan for him to hit the pothole, I'm not a psychopath it only occurred to me to avoid driving over the pothole at that speed as we approached.",

    "selftext": "So let me preface this with saying that for six months she had been living with him and his dad in a place that the BF was paying for, but the BF had gotten so fanatic about his conspiracy theories (GMOs are gonna kill us in our sleep, Google is SkyNet, chemtrails, ect) BF's dad bounced to live with family in Oregon. \n\nDuring those six months my roomie was paying her half of rent to keep her things (more of a horde really) here. I said no big deal, sounds good, I'll pay all the utilities until either she moved in fully with him or if they broke up and came back here.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the BF also owns a janitorial firm that, when last I asked a month ago was making $300k in revenue annually. \n\nOnce BF's dad bounced, he ends the lease there and moves in with my roomie. Of which none of this is discussed with me. Just one day boom, him and all his stuff is here in our tiny apartment. \n\nOn 12/21/15, the day before I left to go be with family for a couple weeks out of state for Christmas, I basically said, after two months of this, and a stern review of our lease agreement that \"Hey, this is cool and all, but I don't think it's fair that we have three people here and rent is only being split two ways, so starting 2/1/16 I'd like us to split that three ways.\" She got a little heated but seemed fine with it.\n\nFast-forward to tonight's melt down. I'm in my room coding for a project that's wayyyyy behind, and she comes in slamming the doors. I kindly ask her to please, for the sake of our neighbors (we're in a cramped 11 unit building with paper-thin walls) don't slam the doors. Then she blows up telling me that her BF 'Moved out' (funny because he never officially 'moved in') and he's living out of his car. Also in this hour long adult tantrum I learned from her that:\n\n-I \"hate\" her because I leave the lights on (I'm still paying 100% of the utilities) and don't lock the door when I'm home.\n-She \"had\" to pee in Jar a couple days ago b/c I was using the shower. Despite the fact I never lock the bathroom door and we have a shower curtain (her mother put in)  to accommodate for this.\n-She \"was\" going to \"kill her self\" which really was just her punching her bed for about 15 minutes in pitch darkness, before I also asked her to stop that too b/c noise.\n\n\nBut really I do kinda feel like a dick that this dude is living out of his car because of something I said. \nHowever on the other side of that coin, I feel he is choosing to do that, because $433 a month ain't a bad deal for living in a SoCal beach town. Most folk would give their last nut for that. Also most folks (myself included) don't own a company making six-figures of revenue\n\n\nAny insight? \n\n[Update] Wow, thanks for everyone's responses. I'm really overwhelmed by the outpouring of support on this topic. It clearly struck a cord with a lot of people. The roomie just got home and apologized for last night. I said it's all right we all have our moments. I understand stress. And do care about her. She then said something along the lines of \"If I do kill my self I don't (or do, it was muffled) be at my funeral.\" So clearly there's still some suicidal ideation, of which I'm gonna reach out to some of her family about. \n\nThen she proceeds to clean up the mess in the kitchen (she took up candle making while I was gone, making it even more unusable). I walk in to get some water, and she's all \"YOUR kitchen is clean,\" my reply was \"Thank you, *our kitchen* is clean.\"  And it's been snide passive-aggressive pleasantries since. Improvement :/",

    "selftext": "Hello /r/AmITheAsshole, first time poster and lurker since a few days back. I recently got in a bit of a bind and I'd appreciate any input. I'm sorry for the extremely long post.\n\nSo, I live in a foster family together with another girl. We are both 17 and live upstairs, fairly secluded from the rest of the family, so it's pretty similar to a normal apartment since we do all the work upstairs ourselves. I've lived here for bout 6 months and she (let's call her Kate) has lived here for a year and 2 months, so I'm the newcomer, I guess. I'm relatively inept with women (have lived a very isolated life, because of problems I won't get into here) but I initiated conversation with Kate after the first week or so, since I didn't wanna live next to someone and never talk to them. We got along really well and ended up spending lots of time and doing practically everything together. Most people who saw us probably assumed we were a couple because of the way we interacted, like filling our texts to each other with hearts and kissy faces. We were really close, talked about literally everything. Even watched porn together a few times and casually commenting on the actors' performance.\n\nSo naturally I got a bit of a crush on her (no need to tell me dating roommates, and especially someone in your foster family, is bad) and forever alone-me decided to summon the courage to ask her out. I did, and while I was kind of disappointed in the rejection, I was expecting this (imo she's way out of my league) and completely understood. I have not brought it up since, out of respect.\n\nOne day I went to pick Kate up from school, and she made me wait around 20 minutes before finally coming over. Turns out she was talking to this guy (let's call him Tom) and they're alright friends but no one she'd actually hang out with (according to her), just someone who's somewhat alright to pass the time in school. I did ask Kate if she had any interest in him, to which she plainly said no and that she's not attracted to people like him (Tom's pretty dark skinned).\n\nAfter this I meet Tom a few times when picking Kate up and figure that to potentially make me less jealous (because I really don't want to be, I know I'm not entitled to be and it makes me feel really bad) I should talk to him a bit and get to know him. I find out Tom's a recent immigrant from some middle-eastern country and has only been here for just over a year, but can already speak our language well enough to be understood, which is pretty cool. I don't get super friendly with him but I can tell he's a good guy.\n\nKate occasionally tells me stories of her hanging out with Tom, some include: Once he brought her with him to where he lived, which was some shelter-esque arrangement with other immigrants living in rooms nearby. Tom hadn't prepared her for this at all and it frankly scared her when they were watching TV and suddenly around 10 immigrants appear in the doorway. Kate told me she never wanted to come with him home again.\n\nAnother time, according to Kate, our foster parents brought Tom to our house (almost) against her wishes. Kate didn't say anything as she has a hard time standing up for herself, and had to endure the day together with him. After Tom left, she told me she never wanted him at our house again.\n\nNow that the backstory's over and done with, let's get to the main incident... \n\nJust a few days ago, I went to the mall to buy winter clothes for a vacation I was leaving for the next day. I had to get up at 6:30 the next day (will be important later), and I'm very much not a morning person. When I came back, I expected it to be just me and Kate but apparently she had brought Tom home. I obviously remembered what she'd said about never bringing him home and how she doesn't really wanna be friends with him, but I held my tongue and figured whatever, she can do what she likes. I went upstairs and did some stuff on my computer, while hearing them downstairs clearly having a good time. \n\nTom was still around when it started getting pretty dark, so I texted Kate to ask if he's sleeping over. She said no. She also texted me asking \"what are you up to?\" to which I replied \"not much, you?\". No reply. This happened a few times during the evening. \n\nAround 8:30, they went up to her room and just a short while later, I hear noises that sound distinctly like fucking. I listen for a few minutes to really make sure that's what I'm hearing. They were only like 10 feet and a door away from me, and she made quite the piercing noises. I put my headphones on and play loud music to try and block it out as it's making me feel sick. \n\nAfter a little while, Tom exits the room, comes up to me and says \"I'm leaving, see ya\" like normal. I say goodbye to him and go back to my computer. Maybe 15 minutes later Kate also leaves the room and comes up to me and asks me why I'm not sleeping. Conversation went something like this:\n\nKate: Hey, why aren't you sleeping? Don't you have to get up early tomorrow?\nMe: Yeah, but I can't sleep.\nKate: Oh, why not? \nMe: Well, you were making quite the noise in there.\nKate: Did you try to sleep?\nMe: No, I'm pretty sure I couldn't sleep to that noise.\nKate: What noises?\nMe: I'm pretty sure you know.\nKate: We haven't really made noises. Besides, you kept me up until 5 AM yesterday when you were at the computer.\nMe: I'm sorry, but you didn't tell me or complain yesterday.\nKate: Well, you didn't complain either.\n\nAt this point I'm just baffled and shake my head and turn back to the computer. She leaves and doesn't talk to me for the rest of the evening.\n\nNow, a few days later, I'm on said vacation. I felt really shitty that whole night and couldn't sleep for shit, so I didn't feel well in the morning either. Since then, Kate has texted me once, late on the day I left, asking how I was doing and if I had done any skiing, complete with kissy faces and hearts and everything, seemingly pretending yesterday didn't happen. That was two days ago now and I have not replied. She's also sent me two snaps on Snapchat, which I have not viewed. \n\nThis is the longest time we've gone without talking since we met. I feel really hurt by her actions and any romantic feelings I may have had for her died the same moment I heard them fool around in her room. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. Part of me wants to never talk to her ever again, but I'm still going to be living with her, and I don't want to make hell for myself. I know I haven't given her a chance to explain anything but seeing as she hasn't acknowledged anything even happened, I haven't really wanted to hear her side. I've decided to not do anything rash until I get my mind together.\n\nWhat I want to know though, roughly summarized, is this:\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to her at all because I feel hurt and betrayed about this whole situation? Or am I just too entitled and overly jealous about someone else getting with her and should chill out?",

    "selftext": "It started out as a discussion about vegetarianism, whether or not we should eat meat or not. She stated that one of the reasons we should eat meat is because humans are designed to eat meat, which I declared to be a fallacious argument and stated that the reason we are designed to eat meat is because the human predecessors mainly lived off of eating meat. Of course we are naturally designed to eat it but it doesnt prevent us from eating vegan food. Especially because the reason we ate meat was because we as a species didnt start developing agriculture until around 10000 years ago. Then she tells me that I can't say that humans eating meat is wrong, the same way i can't say that moose's or shark's are wrong. This made me go batshit insane as humans eating meat is a behavioural pattern, not a species, and just because the laws of evolution happened to give us traits that favored a certain option, doesn't neccesarily mean we have to stick to it, especially if there is an option that could work better, in my eyes, but that is not relevant to this post. Then i made the comparison that *should* we treat women like the natural reproducers, with the main purpose of their existance being taking care of offspring and preparing meals, just because their biological traits lead to this being a soceital structure? This made her very upset and she told me that that is a social and cultural structure, not connected to biology whatsoever(among other things). So I am wondering, was I the one who took a step to far by in her eyes saying that women are made to take care of offspring and prepare meals, which indirectly prevents them from getting high paid, prestigious jobs or is she pulling a non sequitur?\nAka, am I or she the asshole?",

But no, I'm here for advice now.\n\nI've been married a little over three years now. And have done some great things in that time. But lately I've been suspecting that my husband does not help me be a better person. \n\nWe argue, everyone does don't they? I know I can be emotional and can get worked up about things... but I kind of feel like he most often feels he is never at fault for starting an argument. \n\nRegardless of if he's insufferable - he's not the one who starts the argument so he's not the one who's in the wrong. \n\nFor example, last night we had been out drinking. So yes, booze is involved and impaired reason. On our way home I gave him specific instructions about the journey. Immediately his reply indicated he had completely ignored me and what I said. As these instances often occur, my patience with them is quite drawn so I was short with him. He proceeded to get aggressively defensive and continuously ask and push me for a response 'what did I do wrong' and then ignore what I have to say and continue asking and not listening to my response and going around and around in circles until I get upset. It will get to a point that he will physically block me on my way, tell me I'm crazy and then leave me distressed. \n\nThis is a pattern of our arguments and I'm sick of it and sick of his behaviour. He is quite self centered and doesn't go out of his way unless he benefits. He rarely thinks of other people first unless he benefits. I guess that's why he made me feel so special because he was benefiting from pursuing a relationship with me.\n\nTL:DR AMITA for thinking my husband is an asshole? \n\nI'm also asking is this kind of stuff in a relationship normal? I mean, he has his good points, but he is really really wearing my patience thin and I feel like he doesn't help me be a better person. \n\nLooking forward to the responses. \n\nEdit:\nWe weren't driving. We were cycling, it is a route I take daily and I was just pointing out busy intersections and better ways to get through (there are roadworks on the way and it is not very well marked for cyclists on the way). \n\n",

It's not that I don't agree with him, since it *is* his house, it's just that methods could be different. \n\nFor example, doing dishes was an absoulte disaster everytime I did them. You have to stack it in *just* the right way or my father will cause a shit storm. The result is the same: clean, non-broken dishes that are easy to remove from the dishwasher (and usually done in less loads too). He got pissed and called me all kind of obcenties. He refused to talk to me for 2 weeks, lol. (Note: I am currently 16F and my father is 48M). This is just one instance. For the most part I try my hardest to follow his insturdtions to the T. \n\nThe current situation is that my shower handle completely came off and you have to turn the water on by using a pair of pliers (I realize that it's weird, but we haven't had time to contact a plumber). My Dad told me he will start the shower for me at 8:00 pm every single night.\n\nHe changes the time how he sees fit, generally anywhere from 7:30 to 9:30. It has only once started at 8:00. I have shit to do during the day so I'm pretty much dead tired by the time 9:00 rolls around, since I have to wake up at 5:30.  \n\nIm waiting for my Dad to start the shower, and by 9:20 rolls around I said \"fuck it\" and started the shower myself. Nothing broke. Everything is completly fine. Water wasn't too hot to waste hot water, nothing happened out of the ordinary. It was a 10 minute shower. I learned after the fact that he thought it was a good time to take a nap. \n\nMy dad walks into my bedroom and here's the conversation:\n\n\"Alright ____, let's start the shower\"\n\n\"I already a showered, i just turned it on by myself\" \n\n\"....You fucking didn't\"\n\n\"...I did.\"\n\n\"You fucking bitch, don't ask for anything from me ever again\".\n\nThat's pretty much how it went. My family is **pissed** at me because now my Dad won't talk to anyone and is in a bad mood. I broke the rules but I think it was justified. I handled it responsibly, it's not like I broke the damn thing.\n\nI broke his rule and in his eyes I probably acted like a brat, I was a bit pissy when he was questioning me, so I probably did come off as having and additude. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?  Thank you for reading :)\n\n**TL;DR: Started the shower by myself, dad was pissed after he told me not too. Felt justified because he wasn't honoring the time.** \n\nEDIT: spelling/grammar",

With my plans for the future up in smoke, one thing led to another and I'm stuck in a low pay dead end job 50 miles from my friends and hometown. I'm treated like crap at the job, tried to talk to a manager but it's been made clear nothing can be done. \n\nBackstory covered. I've been feeling so stressed and down about every aspect of my life that I've been increasingly pessimistic and recently suicidal. One particular bad shift at work accompanied by angry texts from my father and dismissive messages from my friends led me to break down in tears on the way home from work. I stood at the edge of a busy road, cars rushing past seriously contemplating taking that one step into oncoming traffic and just ending it. I had Samaritans (the UK suicide helpline) ready to dial, everything became too much and I ended up just crying by the roadside for half an hour. Since then I'd say I've stabilized, but suicidal thoughts are still prevalent. \n\nI've mentioned it to my doctor, and I'm taking anti-depressants to try and help. But still, I've constantly been thinking that I'm an asshole for not talking to my friends and family about this. As far as they know, I'm moderately depressed and simply hate my job. If they believe different, they sure don't treat me like there's anything to worry about. I feel I should let them know, and be honest with them but at the same time I really don't want to make them worry that I'm going to off myself at every opportunity.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole for not telling my friends and family I'm suicidal?",

He lived his entire life with my grandmother in a trailer. He was her caretaker. They had a lot of pets. 3 dogs, 12 cats, and a parrot. On the 7th, my mom woke me up to tell me my uncle might be dead. My mom, dad, and myself went to my grandma's trailer, and the medics confirmed it. The police were also there, and to make a long story short the house was deemed unfit for human residence. I.E it was a complete shithole, like one of those episodes of Hoarders. My dad, being a good son, offered my grandma to stay by us for the time being while she sorts everything out. \n\nThese pets are all horrible. None of them were house broken and they keep shitting and pissing everywhere. My parent's house smells like urine. The dogs keep running around making noise, when one barks, all of them barks. They bark at the slightest sound. There are cats crawling everything, jumping on the tables and shedding on all the couches. The parrot won't shut up, it keeps meowing and barking and saying my uncle's name. It won't stop. \n\nI am the one who has to take care of these animals, even though I didn't agree to it. I have to change the litter boxes, walk the dogs, and feed them. Also, every time I try to clean the birdcage or feed the parrot, it tries to bite me. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm on the fence about this one. I'm not sure if I'm upset over nothing. \n\n\nI live in a rented semi-detached house. My new neighbours, who are renting out the other side of the semi-detached (different landlords), have a large Dodge Ram truck that doesn't fit in their driveway which causes the truck to overhang onto my walkway to my front door. That irks me but I can easily go around it so I haven't bothered to bring it up. They also drive across my driveway to get to theirs. Again, that isn't the main problem just another thing to add to what mildly annoys me. I do understand that their vehicle is large, the wife is pregnant, and they have a toddler so parking in the driveway is a lot better for them than parking on the street where their car wouldn't obstruct my walkway.\n\n\nWhat I am most upset about is that they use my driveway for their friends to park when they visit. I don't have a car and rarely do my friends drive to my place but, to me, it feels like they're invading my space and using property I pay rent for as their own. When their friends aren't using it, they have their kids play there. Normally I would just ask them to not do that but I don't own the house and also have never spoken to them so I don't want our first interaction to be a complaint.\n\n\nIt wasn't them but one of their friends who used my driveway who loudly complained (I heard it clearly from inside the house) to his wife that my house was trashy. Admittedly, it did have a tonne of junk out front because other tenants in my house had just moved out that weekend and left the porch full of their garbage and old furniture. That pissed me off and made me decide I did not want anyone using the driveway if they were not living here/one of my guests. Again, I can see why they use the spot because we live on a busy street and their friends have young children as well.\n\n\nAm I the Asshole for not wanting my neighbours to feel entitled to space I rent but do not use? It is a massive convenience for them as they have young children and are pregnant. \n\nEDIT: just found out that the houses weren't designed to have driveways. That explains why they are so small and that the neighbours have a fire hydrant in front of their driveway and their curb doesn't dip in front (which is why they drive over my lot).  Not sure if that makes me more or less of an asshole.  ",

He is saying that most multiplayer video games are MOBAs because of the literal sense of MOBA being \"Multiplayer Online Battle Arena\". I agree that he is correct if you look at it literally, but you can't look at things like game genres. If you looked at them literally then that would mean almost every game is an RPG because in most games you play a role. My argument is that most multiplayer games are not MOBAs because when you look at how actual MOBAs like Dota and League of Legends work, that does not apply to most multiplayer games. Please answer this straw poll to show who is correct in this case.\n\nhttp://strawpoll.me/6593521\n\nEDIT: Here are more points from my friend:\n\n\"Well since my side of the argument was boiled down to one sentence, I'll explain my points here.\n\n1) the literal meaning of moba is multiplayer online battle arena. This means it's a game that is played online with more than one person, with some sort of conflict, and in an enclosed space. Sounds like many games, right?\n\n2) OP's main argument is the wikipedia article for moba which explains the basic workings of a dota like game. While wikipedia is usually a fairly reliable source, I don't feel it is in this case.\n\n3) moba is a casual term for a dota like game. That's just like saying a lectern is a podium because most people call it a podium.\n\nI feel like I'm in the right here in terms of the literal definition and am just trying to end this argument.\"\n\n\n",

We did long distance for a year, during which I went on a few dates, but never got anywhere with anyone. She moved to my state after that year of long distance, and after about  8-9 months she started living with me and my friend, out of convenience for her job.  \nWe broke up after about 6 weeks through us both being extremely stressed out and not being very open and honest about it. I dated a couple of girls after we broke up, but did the classic \"overcorrection\" and was drawn back into my old relationship around Thanksgiving of 2014.  \nWe've been together since then, with our ups and downs, but generally we've been better at communicating and working through our problems. We moved in together in July last year, and have been living together without much more than the regular problems ever since.  \n  \nExcept I now want to end it. Again. For good this time. For real. Not out of any petty inabilities to work through problems, but real, legit compatibility issues between us. I won't go into too much detail, but the age difference, the fact that she has all but disowned her family back west, and how incalculably emotional she is... All of this leads me to believe that it's been a good run, but it's finally time to call it quits and go our separate ways.  \n  \nThe problem is that neither of us can afford to get our own place, and whilst she can easily move into a shared place, I don't feel as comfortable doing that, since my friends have all moved away for school, and I don't like the idea of moving in with a stranger.  \n  \nSo I am staying put for now, putting on a brave face, and saving up enough money to be able to put down a deposit on a (small) place that I can have to myself, with a view to breaking up closer to the time that the contract on our current house comes up for renewal.  \n  \nAm I being an asshole?  \n  \n**TL;DR - Living with girlfriend, have come to realise that we are not going to work out long-term, want to break up but can't for financial reasons.**",

In general I will usually be aware that i missed something and ill say something along the lines of \"sorry i missed that, what did you ask?\" but she will respond with stuff like \"Whatever just go play with you internet bf\" and stuff which really pisses me off because i do not give 1 shit about most of the people i play with, im just focused on what i am doing. I don't necessarily think she is being an asshole for being upset i didn't hear her, but more so the shitty comments she gives.... Soooo AITA\n\nEDIT 1: So people are saying im an asshole for playing video games while she is with me... Let me ELI5 this to you all...24 hours in a day... i sleep 8 hours... 24-8=16... From there i wake up kiss her goodmorning and get ready for work 16-8=8 as soon as work is out i go pick her up again and spend the last 8 hours with her... in this time period i play video games maybe 2-3 hours.... so out of 8 (awake) hours with her i spend 5-6 hours focused on her and only give myself about 2 hours of time to enjoy myself.... \n",

I sure like to help people and listening to the problems, but i slowly start to grow more and more tired of doing so with him. Its like i can help him in the short term, but it seems like i cant help him long term. And after talking to him about his problems i feel really drawn out and need a break of a couple of hours. And on top of that im currently having my own problems in life.\n\nBut when im thinking about stopping to talk to him, i imagine making him really upset because he told me that of all the help he is getting by his parents, his doctors and his anti-depressant, i am the only help that works for him.

    "selftext": "Met a girl during December. We became friends. We have a lot of mutual friends in common, including one guy I consider a good friend. However, after what this girl did, I have been avoiding her as well as anything involving hanging out with her.\n\nI started to develop feelings for her. She was flirting with me a lot. So, I asked her out. She said no, and that was fine by me. Of course I felt shitty, but we left it behind and continued hanging out.\n\nOne week after rejecting me, she began to act very romantic with me. She began holding my hand in public, telling me how much she enjoys being with me, cuddling with me, etc. So, I was a bit surprised by this and asked her if she changed her mind about the rejection. She told me \"I want to just be friends\" and that she had \"no idea\" what I meant by how she was flirting with me (even the hand holding). I told her to stop bullshitting and leading me on, and I haven't done anything with her since.\n\nThe part that I'm angry about is how she knew I had feelings for her, yet decided to act like she was interested in me (she also liked it when people mistook us for a couple). When I asked her about it, she told me she had no idea she was doing anything. To me, this just reeks of narcissism, selfishness, and a need to control others. I was fine after the initial rejection, but the fact she did this and tried to act like she did nothing wrong made it very hard for me to be able to trust her.\n\nMy friends agree with me that she was wrong. She has also since apologized to me. However, I don't want anything to do with her anymore. She still asks me to hang out and such, but I always make up an excuse. (the fact she still asks me to do things together further confirms how I feel) \n\nMy close friend I mentioned at the beginning of this post seems to have pigeon-holed me into the \"nice guy who got friendzoned\" category and that I should stop being dramatic and just get over it. He says I'm being too narrow-minded (not sure if this is the correct word in English). I disagree: to me, she's proven that she's willing to manipulate me. Again, I'm not angry at the rejection- I'm angry at the fact we're in our early 20's and she was playing games with me like a highschool kid.\n\nSo, am I being immature and dramatic over something petty? Or, am I justified in turning down invitations and avoiding situations where I'll be in the same room as this woman? I'm not trying to make things difficult or complicated. I just feel I'm too old to bother with people who don't respect me.",

    "selftext": "This happened about a year ago and I've been kinda torn up about it for a while now, here we go.\nSo I go to a private high school in my city, which is considered to be, and is, pretty expensive. My family works pretty hard to pay for it, my dad works and my mom gets freelance work when she can, but the whole family saves money as much as possible (driving a 1992 Saturn car and our 1997 volvo has been our biggest money saver) however its not like we don't get family time or anything like that, and life is pretty great financially. Despite this there is a pretty negative stereotype against people from my school for being stuckup, which admittedly is true for some people in the community. At the risk of sounding snooty I will say I am not one of these people. It also scares me to death to be profiled as a stuck up brat. This is where my story comes into play. Where I presume I made the decision (in my mind at least) between stuck up brat, or poor little boy scraping by. \n\nSo I was participating in a sporting event, when one of the parents of the opposing team (this was during a break session) asked me \n\n\"hey, how much does it cost to pay for that school of yours\"\n\nAs someone who rarely talks about money with anyone other than my parents, I was kind of surprised by the question.\n\nCopperflame: \"Sir it costs a lot, but its worth every penny, I love going to school here\"\n\nMan: \"Ya, but how much. does it cost.\" \n\nCopperflame: \"my family works really hard for me to go here\"\n\nMan: \"Ya, but how much. does it cost. Alot? I bet its alot. Tell us how much it costs.\"\n\nI was kind of annoyed at this point just because he really wanted me to be stuck up about it. So I decided it would be good if I lied about my current financial state to break the stereotype of stuck up rich kids at my school. \n\nCopperflame: \"look sir, I have work later to pay for this school. My mom and dad work 2 jobs, so it costs a lot but I will do anything it takes to come here. We save every penny so I can come here, so ya it costs alot, but I'm a lot better for it.\"\n\nMan: \"oh man, sorry about that, have fun out there\"\n\nAt the end he was pretty apologetic so that was nice, but I did lie about my financial situation. Is this a bad thing that negatively influences the reputation of my school? or does it help its reputation by making it look like an accepting community of people from all walks of life?\n\nTL;DR I go to a \"rich boy school\". Family in the middle class. Do I break stereotypes by saying I am poor or should I tell the truth and possibly perpetuate negative stereotypes? \n\nthanks guys, really hope im not an asshole or whatever.",

My uncle is paranoid, schizophrenic and used to be addicted to drugs. I lived with him and my grandma for around two years and he made my living situation awful. Some of the things he did was steal my laptop (he thought I was working with the government to spy on him), he physically attacked my sister for being on her phone (he thought she was recording him) and let my dog purposefully run away.

    "selftext": "**Situation**\n\nAround 4 or 5 years ago when we were in high school, my boyfriend loaned me his Nintendo DS (the original model, nothing fancy) because mine was stolen. With it, Pokemon Platinum and Emerald. He never used it anymore because he had a 3DS. We broke up around a year later, after we started at different colleges, and I never returned it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I still feel kind of guilty about this, but my current bf tells me I shouldn't. He believes that items left with exes are \"fair game,\" but I don't think I agree, especially since the items I left with him were much less valuable. So I set up a list of pros and cons to weigh but I'm still not sure I'm not an asshole. So I'm asking your help.\n\n**Yes, I am the asshole:**\n\n* **I have had opportunities to return it**. We live in the same town, so during summer and breaks I've had plenty of opportunities to return it. He doesn't even live that far from me and I could have just dropped it off in a box without even having to confront anyone. Also, I've hung out with a mutual friend twice since we've broken up (it got weird because she was still so close with him) and although I fully intentioned to give it to her, I totally forgot.\n\n* **It was always a loan, not a gift**. We always intentioned for me to give it back. It was never \"my\" DS, just his that he was loaning me. \n\n* **I don't need it anymore**. My best friend gave me her old DS Lite last Christmas and I bought my own Pokemon game so all I use it for now is to trade between games. Even so, I haven't played since like last Christmas.\n\n* **I brought it to Europe**. I'm studying abroad until July and brought both DS's with me. This just feels like a dick move.\n\n* *His sister. This one is iffy because I can't remember perfectly, but I think his sister used to use it to interact between her Animal Crossing games? (Wild World and New Leaf- she also had a 3DS. Or they shared it. Or she only used it for Wild World before the 3DS was released\u2026 can't remember). So that would be pretty shitty of me to keep it from her. She was such a sweetie and didn't do anything to deserve that.*\n\n* **I am smug**. He didn't treat me great, and the childishness of feeling smug about keeping his DS makes me feel like I'm being an asshole.\n\n**No, I'm not the asshole**\n\n* **He hasn't made an attempt to get it back**. He only mentioned it in passing when we first broke up, and has not tried to make any contact with me for any reason since.\nExact context, because I feel this is unclear. From the email he sent me when he finally \"accepted\" that I had broken up with him:\n\t\t\n*\"I've still got a few of your hats and scarves, and you have my DS, so I guess we'll see each other again to give back to each other things we still have.\"* We never did see each other again, and after this email neither of us attempted contact again.\n\n* **He was a shitty boyfriend/person**. He was very manipulative and controlling in subtle ways and was very good at making me feel guilty for things that were reasonable/beyond my control/not my fault. So it feels kind of justified. ^Maybe ^this ^should ^be ^in ^the ^\"yes\" ^list ^because ^that's ^so ^goddamn ^petty. *Note: sometimes I feel like not asking for it back is a way to continue to make me feel guilty for something I shouldn't have to, but I'm not sure if he's that devious.*\n\n* **He doesn't need it**. He has a 3DS, which he didn't use that much. Also, when we broke up it became very apparent that he had expected us to get married one day (we were 18\u2026 Jesus Christ\u2026) or at least continue the relationship for much much longer. Therefore he wasn't expecting it back for a while.\n\nLay it on me, am I the asshole or not? Should I get it back to him once I get home? (no matter what I'm not paying $40 to ship it to him from Europe lol). Do I deserve to rot in ex-gf/bf hell with my new SO? Am I a freeloading-golddigging-pokemon-loving bitch???\n",

    "selftext": "Hey people's, \n\nFor introductions, I live with two other roommates who we'll call John and Sam for easy reference. John smokes with me very rarely (maybe like 2-3 times a month) and Sam doesn't smoke at all. He doesn't like it, but that stems more from him not liking the stereotype of stoners (I think, but this is info I've heard secondhand from John). \n\nAnyways, normally I smoke outside as to keep any smell from smoking out of the house. I bought a vaporizer to use inside sometimes since that only smells like burnt popcorn, but apparently Sam has said some things to John about it smelling a little bit sometimes, so I basically stopped using that altogether. However, it is now getting to the point where it's 20 degrees or so outside at night and that is the only time I smoke. I like to get all my work and stuff done during the day and then relax at night and watch a movie or something. \n\nRecently, I started closing myself in my room, putting a towel underneath the door, and then closing myself in the bathroom in my room and also putting a towel underneath that door. I light a candle and/or incense in my room, have the fan going in both my room and in the bathroom, and breath all the smoke out of the window in my bathroom. I also Febreze the bathroom after smoking. I feel like I'm doing about as much as I possibly can to keep the smell at the absolute minimum. \n\nNow Sam has never said anything about it to me in the past and we've lived together for 2 years now. Apparently, Sam has been sending some passive aggressive type texts to John saying that it smells like pot and this is pissing him off. John and I both haven't really talked/hung out with Sam in well over 4/5 months. He'll either hangout with just his girlfriend or just stay in his room. Sam seem's to be pissed at me for something and I'm finding it hard to believe it is just the smell because we have been best friends since 7th grade. \n\nJohn say's that he can sometimes smell the tiniest hint of it, but nothing particularly noticeable or offensive (his room is right next to Sam's room). Now I'm left with trying to figure out what to do. I'm pretty disappointed that this is a point of conflict, especially considering the lengths I'm going to keep Sam happy. I'm not ripping bongs in the living room or breathing smoke on every inch of the house, nor am I doing it all day. I pay more in rent than both my roommates, I pay all the utilities, and I handle all communications with our landlords. I feel like there need's to be some compromise other than sending me out into 20 degree weather just because Sam doesn't like the smell of pot.\n\nAm I being an asshole for having this position on the matter? The most frustrating part is that Sam won't say anything about it to me or communicate any grievances with me, he tends to be a very quiet person. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long story. I appreciate anything you all have to say and if I am the asshole in this situation, I'd be happy to know so I can better correct how I handle this. Thank you. \n\n**tl;dr**: It is getting really cold outside (20 degrees) so I've been smoking out of the window in my bathroom, in my room, while lighting candles to keep the smell to an absolute minimum. This is still irritating one of my roommates. \n--------\nedit: Just as a point of clarification, I learned about Sam's potential issue with the smell about 3 or 4 days prior to this posting. I have not smoked in the house since. ",

I'm sorry if I haven't been active here before, I will in the future :-) I'm going to try and keep it short (did not succeed!) but objective.\n\nEdit: tl;dr? A friend of ours that used to work at our company (a caf\u00e9 and an online store) quit and sold goods to us. He didn't invoice us for a year. He was going to take over our caf\u00e9. We went out of business, he still hadn't invoiced us. He owed us 4000 USD, we had paid his rent for 3000 USD, there's inventory in the caf\u00e9 for at a minimum 1000 USD. We owe him 10.000 USD. I tried to settle somehow, he is just angry, refuses to speak to me and blames his slim chances of having any kind of a future on us. \n\nAll right, that was my attempt of making a very complicated story simple. If you, by any chance feel compelled to know more, here's the longer version:\n________________________________________________________\nA little background: me and my husband started a business a few years ago, a caf\u00e9 open during the summer and an internet store, and after a few months, a guy with interest in the niche we were in (name here: Peter) in started to work for us and we fast became friends. Peter was a nice man but very depressed.\n\nBecause we were just starting up we couldn't pay him a lot (edit:14 USD/ hour) so we made a deal, but a very vague one. Peter was going to work for us and work hard and we would give him a piece of our business. After a year or so we were tired of him not really doing his share (=normal working hours) and we had a talk. Peter said he had stopped doing his share because he knew he wasn't going to get a piece of the business and we all agreed that we all had communicated really badly. Because the summer season was coming, we said \"all right, let's put this discussion on hold for now and talk about it after the summer\". As if we had learned nothing at all from communicating badly, we both drew our own conclusions from the meeting: we thought Peter should keep on being just an employee because he was king of ineffective but that we'd talk about it after the summer, whereas Peter thought he was going to work his ass off to prove he was worthy of being a part of the company. And so he did. He worked hard during the summer and we didn't pay attention. \n\nCome winter, he's been sacking off for a while and I talk to him again. Peter gets really angry and we all agree that we've been bad at communicating (again). However, this time he wants to quit, we want to fire him but he also wants compensation for his overtime. This is fair (even though he was super inefficient for a long time after the summer). But Peter wants five months pay! That's 830 hours overtime and he's only worked with us for about a year and a half. When he says this, it's in an email, he says we should never pay people under the table (which we had done in the beginning) and that he cares about us and would not want to see us locked up in jail. \n\nIt's not the disguised threat that makes us agree, it's some kind of state of total forgiveness and spiritual surrender. So we paid him and stopped talking. \n\nDuring the several months we didn't talk, Peter started his own business, in the same niche, importing a brand that we already had started selling and became their head distributor in Sweden. So we had to go through him to buy their products all of the sudden. This pissed us off a while because we had talked to them about distrubution first but we quickly forgot about it. \n\nAfter almost a year, Peter wrote to me and said he missed me (we had been closer friends than him and my husband) and asked if we could see each other again. I was a bit hesitant but after a while we did start to hang out. \n\nAs I previously stated Peter suffers from depression and I quickly started caring a lot for him again, mothering instincts maybe. He was alone and had no children and he wanted a family so sometimes we wondered if he liked hanging around with us and our four kids or if it also made him sad. Anyhow, I crocheted a doll for him while he was really down, drove by and knocked on his door when nobody could get hold of him and we had long phone conversations. \n\nAt the same time we bought Peter's merchandise and he worked for our caf\u00e9 a little bit, as a chef (he's slow but makes great food) during the summer. \n________________________________________________________\n\nThat's the background. Now for the current state of affairs:\n\nOur business hadn't been going too well for quite some time. When Peter (edit tl:dr?: a friend who had been working with our company who now sold merchandise to us) invoiced us for his merchandise, I had so many other invoices to pay and I paid the people that were most vocal about it first. That meant that I was late paying him and apparently (we didn't know this) he lost his bank credit because of our late payments. And then he stopped invoicing us, yet continued to provide us with his merchandise. He invoiced us really, really slowly but I thought he did that with everyone (now I think he was slow with everyone but even more with us). \n\nIn the spring last year, I started telling Peter he had to start invoicing us. I was scared of him doing it all at once as we did owe him quite a bit of money. So maybe I acted that way when I told him to send us invoices. Maybe I said \"Oh, we're happy if you don't but please do\". \n\nCome summer and our internet business is doing really badly now so we decide we won't have time for the caf\u00e9 this year, we need to put all our focus on the internet part. We offer Peter to take care of the caf\u00e9. He gets all the revenues and pays all costs BUT we pay the rent. He says yes and my father, who's been working with him in the kitchen before, goes along with it. All costs for the caf\u00e9 are invoiced to us and then we invoice him (but not the rent). Also, he buys merchandise from us now, to sell in the caf\u00e9. I give him good prices and tell him he doesn't have to hurry in paying. \n\nI start telling Peter more often to invoice us now, because our accountant is mad about him not paying his invoices to us and I tell her, well that's because we owe him a lot of money, but there are no traces of us owing him money (= no invoices). \n\nDuring fall it becomes obvious we have to do something; our business is going down. We ask Peter if he wants to take over the caf\u00e9 and we all agree that he will start paying the rent by himself in September and that we will get the rental contract over to him as soon as we can. Which we do later in that fall but his contract starts in February.\n\nI tell him more and more often he should write invoices to us as we don't know where our company is going. But I also expressed optimism about the company because we thought we had found a way out.\n\nWe had a supplier (bopp) who was very interested in our company and offered to buy it. Bopp were going to buy it by talking to everyone that we owed money to and make them lower their debts. Then they would pay off our debts. They said it was important NOT to put the business into business failure because of legal aspects. \n\nBUT all of the sudden, after talking to some lawyers, Bopp decided they were going to buy our brand, our internet store and our stock but ask us to put the actual company into business failure. We didn't really have a choice, we couldn't save the company anyway, but it was also a relief. \n\nI told Peter a week or so later, after the fact (it took less than a week for us between knowing and actually handling in the paperwork) and cried a little and he gave me a hug. \n\nI tried to reach Peter after that but wasn't succeeding (very common for him, being depressed and all) so I drove to his house a few weeks later, asked him how he was doing and asked him how our situation had affected him. As one might imagine, when going out of business there are millions of thought, fears and concerns and yes, this was the first time I thought of Peter. He said it had hit him hard and that he had sent his invoices to the lawyers handling our case. I said I was sorry, I said I didn't want any of this to affect our friendship and I cried because I realized what we had done to him. I said that we'd do anything we could to help him and we hugged. He said he appreciated what I had said. I left and it felt like we still were friends and would work it out. \n\nThen, Peter completely blocked me out of his life. Didn't answer his phone nor messages on Facebook. After christmas I wrote him a message on FB saying all right, what can we do about what we owe you (about 10.000 dollars)? You owe us 4000 in invoices and 3000 in rent, there's inventory in the caf\u00e9 for about 1000 (actually worth much more, see below). Can we pay my father salary for the remaining 2000?\n\nNo answer. Phone, no answer. Finally went to his house this weekend and knocked, no answer. I heard music and opened the door, it was open so I yelled \"Hello\" and \"Peter\". No answer. I went to talk to the neighbor for a few minutes then went back. I saw his girlfriend in the window, smiled and waved at her (I didn't know they were dating, she's 17, he's 37 and she was a waitress at the caf\u00e9, sweet girl). She stared at me as you would when seeing your beloved's worst enemy. I knocked again, she turned away and called on him. Nobody let me in. \n\nI wrote to her that night on FB. Said I didn't want to try and make her change sides or anything but we've been trying hard to find a solution with him...\n\nShe didn't answer but Peter finally did. His letter was drenched in contempt. His points were that he was trying to help us and be nice when he didn't invoice us and never thought we would \"give him the finger\". He said we could've written over all the inventory on him before going out of business and we'd be even but we didn't have the decency to even contact him beforehand. He said we had clumsily lost all of his remaining money and now he had to take an expensive loan that he'd have to pay interest on for seven years to even be able to run the caf\u00e9 until the season starts and that he wasn't going to owe us anything for rent because the deal that he would pay the rent went out the window the moment we told him to f--- himself.\n\nThe inventory left in the caf\u00e9 is worth about 6000-7000 USD. Of course I have written and tried to convince him that he's wrong but that's not important. I have now sent a message saying \"we were going to leave you the inventory at the caf\u00e9 and we still are. Here's a list of what it is and how much it's worth. But. You need to admit this inventory and the caf\u00e9 is actually worth something. If you don't do that, we'll come and get it this weekend. And we will pay you the remaining 2000 USD when we can.\"\n\nAre we the assholes considering the following:\n\n-I don't think wis pride will allow him to reply \n-If we get the remaining inventory he won't have a base to start running the caf\u00e9 even if we do pay him cash eventually\n-He will probably fail due to this\n-He will be in debt for a long time with a worthless caf\u00e9, a long rental contract and no inventory to sell\n-And considering his depressed state he will have a hard time to get a job\n\nThank you for reading if you've made it this far.\n\n\n",

He gave me back a pro-rated portion of my rent and everything was fine. However, I had nowhere to go on such short notice. My younger brother allowed me to crash on his couch (actually use his room since he was never in it) until I could find a place to live. \n\n\nAbout a week or so in, one of his two room mates comes to me and asks if I'd be interested in taking over his portion of the rent/lease. He just couldn't afford it anymore. Rent is cheap, especially split three ways, so I said sure. We even switched the utilities in my name since my brother and his other room mate had horrible credit. Room mate #2 moves out and they release him of his contractual obligations through the leasing office. \n\n\nI go to turn in my application so I can sign the lease, and since I have a dog (about 50lbs, shepherd mix), I'm willing to pay the pet fee up front, too. However, the leasing office tells me their weight limit is 35lbs and the breed (German shepherd) isn't allowed because it's \"aggressive.\" Rules are rules, whatever, they won't budge, and I'm not giving up my dog for a place I won't be living in come six months (lease will be up), so I decide to move out. I even offer to pay off the remaining utilities for them to switch and the next month's rent so they can find another room mate. \n\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, we're all in the fault for not realizing up front the strict pet rules/weight limit before releasing room mate #2 and having me sign on. \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole for moving out and keeping my dog?",

We moved from Ohio to our current home when I was 5, so all of our family lives in Ohio which is hundreds of miles away. My dad's paycheck goes towards bills, while my mom's goes towards shopping (like groceries and school clothes, rarely luxury items).\n\nNow my grandpa, my mom's dad, has a foot in the grave. She felt it was only right that she go to Ohio and spend his last days with him, which is fair of course. That was *two weeks ago,* and she insists that she stay with her dad until he passes. That could be another month for all we know.\n\nNow she apparently expects my dad to support four people and two animals with only one paycheck. My mom's last paid vacation day was yesterday, so from this point forward we're kinda fucked on money if she doesn't come home. So a few days ago my dad texts her and asks when she's coming home. She responds \"When my dad dies.\"\n\nNow every day since, my dad has been calling her at least thrice a day because he wants to try to get her to see reason. She's never picked up. So yesterday he texts her, basically asking what her plan is here. Her exact response: \"Fuck off leave me the fuck alone.\" Then apparently blocked his number because she hasn't responded to anything from him since.\n\nSo now *I'M* super pissed off at her. And that's saying something, because usually I fucking hate my dad and love my mom. So today *I* sent her a text fully explaining my argument and asking her to please figure out what she wants to do. I also said that I understand why she wants to be with her dad, but reminded her that she has a family *here* that needs and misses her. Even though I'm steaming mad, there were no signs of aggression in my text because I figured she wouldn't respond if there was.\n\nHer response: Fuck off [My dad's name] I know this is u. I'm so alone and losing my daddy and u don't even give a fuck. How fucking heartless are u\"\n\nI responded with a picture of me saying \"I guess I'm heartless too\". Now I *never* take pictures of myself and she knows this, so any given selfie of me was likely just taken.\n\nShe responded \"Fuck off\". I have no evidence supporting this but I can only assume she blocked my number too.\n\nI know the rules of this subreddit say to describe both sides, but my mom's side of the argument is basically \"Fuck off, my dad's dying.\" If you have anything you'd like me to clarify I will do so.\n\n**TL;DR of my side:** Yes, having a dying dad is tragic. Yes, wanting to be with your dying dad is completely understandable. No, leaving your family to go to Ohio for an undetermined amount of time is not okay.",

I got up early and had to leave for work and didn't see my roommate to talk about it but I'm already fed up and ready for the cat to be gone. I'm pretty sure he could keep his cat at his moms house or something but I'm not sure. He won't be living with me very long, only a couple weeks before he moves to texas for a job thing. Would I be an asshole if I told him he can't have his cat at my house until he moves out?\n\n\nUPDATE: I got home from work and only one of my roommates (not the one with the cat) was home too. I said hello to all the kitties including the new guy, and he was being kinda sweet but all of a sudden attacked the shit out of my arm. Not like a nip, but full blown wrapped around my arm and attacked my forearm. He then continues to be a dick to my other cats who were just playing nice. I had enough when he tried to fuck with my old man kitty who does literally nothing but sleep all day and mind his own business. I tried to shoo him away and he got all defensive like he was going to attack me again for it. I've had cats all my life and this one was starting to scare the shit out of me. I ended up getting him by the scruff and booting him to his bedroom. My other roommate was around when this was happening and telling me he's pissed about the cat too.\n\nMy roommate came home moments after that, and before I had even said hello, my other roommate came up and immediately told him how much he hates the cat already. He was meowing loud as fuck all night and he pointed out the piss problem and also brought up that he had attacked my arm (which I told him about after it happened). He took the news pretty well and we discussed everything within the last 24hrs and I also told him about it being Spay and Neuter month. He said he will look up some places online and take the cat to the vet tomorrow and get it done ASAP. I'm sure this asshole attitude and spraying is because of that and he's the only non neutered male in the house so he feels the need to assert his dominance. ",

I am a male and they are both females. Susan says I have issues with talking aggressively and being too confrontational in the way that I speak normally, this is hard for me to understand as I am just trying to communicate myself to the best of my ability, so that the other person can understand me, its hard to \u201cpull back\u201d on how I talk as I tend to think people are being too sensitive about how I'm delivering the message. To quote her, \u201cIts not what I'm saying but HOW I'm saying it\u201d. When Jenna and I get into it I tend to fall back on logic when I'm arguing, I want things to be fair, even if I'm wrong (I'm totally fine with being wrong, a person just has to prove to me with facts that I am wrong before I will agree with them) and she usually has a hard time using logic when defending her reasoning, more often Jenna just wants to feel what she is feeling and she wants me to accept that. Even if logically it makes zero sense and I disagree with her. We have since stopped being friends because of this kind of conflict, Jenna says she doesn't like being around me anymore because according to her \u201cI don't let her feel feelings in her own house\u201d. So my question is am I actually an asshole for having an opinion, disagreeing with her about her logic and not saying its ok to feel a certain way when I don't agree with her reasoning or am I totally within my rights as an individual and a friend by being honest with her because to me that is what a true friend would do?\n",

I don't think were like super close friends but I feel like we were/are friends. So now on to the actual story. For the purposes of this story lets call my roommate John. \n\nAbout a week ago my roommate (John) was kicked completely out of the dorms at my school. John and another friend (lets call him Brian) were involved in a situation that got them kicked off campus, totally unrelated to this story though. So yesterday John and Brian moved into a new place off campus and they invited a bunch of other friends (who I consider friends too) over to help them move in and had a little housewarming party and stuff. I wasn't explicitly invited but I texted John about it and asked him whether I could come and he never replied. He had just texted me less than 5 minutes before... Do they not want me there or do they just not care enough to invite me? Am I the asshole for being pissed about them not inviting me?  Was I wrong to assume they would invite me? Should I have just gone with my suitemate who was going even though they did not specifically invite me? \n\nEDIT: \nUpdate: John and Brian are having a superbowl party tonight. I thought I might just tag along with my suitemate, see their new place, say hi, whatever. Texted my suitemate and he said he couldn't take me because he was going straight there from where he was. He just stopped by to grab some stuff. He was here for 10 minutes and got some stuff and got my other suitemate. I walked in and said hi, asked if they were going to the superbowl party, to which they said yes, then stood there awkwardly and then went back to my room. They just left, now it seems to me the my ex-roommate specifically doesn't want me there. I think i'm just talking the whole thing up in my head and jumping to conclusions but i'm not sure. ",

    "selftext": "Ok so this one has a lot of factors but I'll try to keep it short.\n\nLast year my gf and I decided to move in together, but seeing as we're both university students without much of an income, it was difficult to find a landlord who would agree to have us as tenants.\n\nEventually we got word from a family friend. Her coworker was moving out of his flat and he'd show us around.\n\nHe is a very nice guy and I think he liked us, too, because he told his brother, who owns the flat, that we seem like nice and responsible people.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. The flat he was moving into already had a kitchen installed, meaning he couldn't take his old one with him, so he asked if we'd buy it off him. It's about two years old and he'd paid 4000\u20ac for it. He told us his price was a negotiable 3000\u20ac, which is far too much for us, but we agreed to negotiate a price for it, should his brother let us sign the lease.\n\nTo our surprise, we actually got the flat. The landlord told us he didn't care if we bought his brother's kitchen or not. When it came to negotiating a price, we could only get it down to 2000\u20ac, though. Still too much for us, especially since you can get small kitchens for like 800.\n\nWe told him we'd buy one ourselves, while he put his on ebay for 2800. We did, in fact, buy a nice kitchen for 800.\n\nAbout 10 days before moving out, I got a text from the guy, saying nobody will buy his kitchen and he'd sell it to us for 1500\u20ac.\n\nI responded that we'd already bought one, and cancelling the order will cost us a quarter of the retail price as compensation for the store, so 200\u20ac.\nShould we take his kitchen instead, we'd only make a profit if he'd sell it to us for 600. We were, however, feeling a bit sorry for him so we made the offer to buy his for 1000, effectively costing us 1200 because of the compensation.\n\nHe said he'd think about it.\n\nThe next day he sent me a text saying his parents think 1000\u20ac is not enough, so they'll buy it themselves and leave it in the flat, letting us use it.\n\nIn the end, we only had to pay the compensation for the store. \nWhile initially I was quite pleased with my negotiating skills (From 3000 down to 200), I was (and am still) not sure if I am the asshole here.\n\nFriends and family say it's his fault for being too greedy. They might be biased though, obviously. \n\nIf it helps my cause, I'd want to add that after living in the flat for a while, it became clear that the kitchen isn't really worth the 4000 he'd paid for it. The appliances are very loud, for example, and there are other minor faults here and there.\n\nStill, this has been bugging me for months: AITA?",

    "selftext": "I probably am. Here's some back story:\n\nSomething recently came up where I realized I was really upset by a statement my bf made. It was along the lines of: \"although I do like pleasuring you, it is a bonus. I'm primarily motivated to have intercourse to meet my own needs and self pleasure. It can be mentally stimulating, but generally I can't get turned on by doing so. Foreplay is more or less a chore since I initiate everything, anyway.\"\n\nSo I tried to bring this up the other night, and I know that it probably wasn't the kindest way to put it, I just wanted to be honest because I realized that in a sense, it scarred me.\n\nI lead with, \"I didn't realize how much *statement* bothered me until I realized that I'm sometimes more put off and feel less inclined to do anything to pleasure you, I'm sorry.\" \nTo which the first words that came out of his mouth are: \"I don't know what you want me to say.\"\n\n He did at a point claim that there is no guy in the world that thought differently, which I then started to compare him. I explained that the only reason why I'm comparing him with my friends is the fact that I wanted him to understand where I'm coming from, and why it's not ridiculous for me to expect something different because my friends have told me otherwise. \n\nI said, \"That's definitely not true, my friends Bob and Nick told me that they actually get physically turned on by being able to please their SO. It exists.\"\n\nAnd before he stormed out, he said \"Well shit, I'm so sorry I'm so shitty to you.\"\n\nI really care about him and honestly don't know how to communicate this in an any more effective or nicer approach, so any tips would be greatly appreciated. Although I know this isn't an advice forum... thanks!\n",

We shut up right away.\n\nNow today, we're all talking about not-necessarily-work-stuff, but the volume starts creeping up.

This is also about the time that the elderly start their day. It's nice that they're trying to support themselves (not nice that they have to), but they do shit that makes travelling about as inconvenient as possible. I don't know about other countries, but the rule of standing by the side of the subway doors to let people out is actually written here, and somehow there are always at least a few people, invariably old, who think they're exempt. They'll stand right in the middle of the door to get on asap. Some stand aside when they see people want to get out, but others push their way in.\n\nAt my stop at the end of the line, and probably others, they'll squeeze at the door and once they open, sprint to the stairs. This is actually okay. They have the right of way (remember we're getting off now), and everyone wants to get out quickly. I have a shuttle bus to catch, and they might have one too. But once they reach the stairs, they slow to a fucking crawl, making a wall of slowness that holds up everyone behind them. I can understand they can't descend as fast as younger people, but don't fucking rush to the front if you're not at least moving at an average pace. You only get a benefit of being in front if you're faster than  the guy in front of you.\n\nThere's this one lady in particular that pisses me off every morning. She's one of those that shoves her way in. She's short and fat and looks at everything like it disgusts her. This kind of fuckface isn't the main thing, but it acts as a multiplier. Once she gets on, she'll rush (waddle quickly) to a seat. That's okay, you're supposed to let the elderly sit anyway. But if there is no seat, she stands in the middle and refuses to hold onto a pole, despite clearly being unable to balance. And she knows this. Every time the train brakes, she stumbles toward the front. So she faces the back and waddles, bumping into people and getting in the way. When the  train brakes, she stumbles back the same distance and bumps people again\n\nSo am I justified in being mad (this has happened every day for the past 3 months) or should I just excuse them because it's shitty they still have to work at their age?

For the last decade we have lived in the same town and been very close. We'd usually see each other a couple times a week, and we have a group of friends that get together at least once a month. But May has been my best friend my whole adult life.\n\nIn the past decade, we have both had ups and downs, because shit happens. She went through five years of progressively worse pain that resulted in a hysterectomy. She always wanted babies (we met and bonded when she was babysitting a mutual friend's daughter) and she was obviously crushed by knowing she'd never have her own. Through all of those years of pain and depression, I was always there for her, as a shoulder to cry on, for distraction when she wanted, or just to listen when she had to explode. Once I stayed with her for two days when her husband feared she might self-harm. In the last year, her life has come together nicely; she and her husband bought a house and a new car and they are preparing to adopt a child. I've seen a lot less of her since they bought the house but it's out in the country (I can't drive) so I expected that and haven't complained.\n\nMeanwhile, my life has fallen apart. I was diagnosed with a chronic, disabling neurological disease, my marriage disintegrated, I can't work in my field anymore because of my diagnosis, and other life crap. Through all of it, I have relied on May; she's the only friend I've felt comfortable being totally honest with (besides my therapist), not having to wear a social mask and pretend things are better than they really are. I'm not generally a negative person; even with my life getting harder, I still look forward to every day, and I still expect that things will turn around eventually. \n\nLast night, May came over for a \"quick visit.\" She told me that she has been coming over less because she can't handle being my friend while I am \"so negative\" about life, always focused on what's going wrong. She said that she doesn't have the energy to be there for me when I don't recognize the good things in life and refuse to \"look on the bright side.\"\n\nThis was completely out of left field. I had no idea that sharing my honest feelings and experiences translated to me being \"hopeless\" and \"negative.\" So I asked for an example. She referred to a conversation we had about whether I should look for a new medical specialist, in which I listed my problems with the current one and asked her advice. When we initially had the conversation she agreed with me that I should look for a new one. Last night she said that instead of focusing on \"all those problems\" I should just be thankful that I have insurance and can get help, instead of griping about how my specialist isn't good enough.\n\nNow I feel like I have to sugar coat every conversation I have with every one. I'm also a little bit angry that she's not willing to be there for me in the same way I was for her. I'll get over the anger, I know it's a temporary emotion and I'm never one to hold a grudge. I can't help feeling disappointed in her though, because I thought she was a good friend and I already miss having someone I can just be myself around,  without having to wear a fake \"social smile.\" Am I the asshole for wanting my friend to accept me for me, even though my life is shitty right now?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the insightful comments. I was feeling no less hurt by my BFF's confession that she doesn't BFF me back but I was moving toward acceptance of yet another thing that needs a \"new normal\"... and then I got an fb Message from May.\n\nImportant: I don't go on fb, ever, I just have the Messenger app. One of the big reasons I don't go on fb is because I have a bad habit of becoming emotionally invested in educating people who post clickbait pseudoscience articles. May helped me make the decision to get off of fb entirely because of a meltdown I had after a popular bastardization of statistics made the rounds last fall.\n\nMay sent me a link to an fb clickbait article titled \"Someone Somewhere cured their Incurable Disease by following this Totally Restrictive Fad Diet!\"  (*It is for a totally different disease,* not the one I have.) \n\n*...huhWhut?*\n-----------\nTL/DR: My best friend doesn't want to spend as much time together because she thinks my perspective on my life is too negative but I was there for her during years of horrible shit in her life. Am I the asshole for expecting more from her?",

    "selftext": "Basically, I [22M] live with 4 other guys. One of them [22M] is homosexual and attracted to me. Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with that fact - not the fact that he's gay but that he's sexually attracted to me. I just want to say now that I have 2 other good friends who are gay and I hang out with one of them a couple of times a week when I'm back in my home town and it's not awkward in the least - because why would it be? I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.\n\nMy housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.\n\nHe knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again. He'll start with the 'Oooh, thanks man, you're so niiiice :)\" or if we go to the shops he'll be like \"our first date, I'm so proud\". Whenever he makes a comment or something that conveys his attraction to me I generally just tell him \"shut the fuck up\" and change the conversational topic (but try to keep it civil on the new topic). It's rarely a direct comment but more often indirect one.\n\nAll of us in the house enjoy mutually abusive (in a jokey way) relationships, but I find myself being very minimally more cold towards him than my other housemates - it's as if I subconsciously feel I have to make him learn that there's nothing about me to love and I'm trying to get him to dislike me. However, this is a double-edged sword because one of the reasons he's into me is because I'm a tall guy and forceful / purposeful in my words and actions - he is really into my 'presence' apparently (he's a small guy and kind of obsessed with height).\n\nIt should probably be noted that I'm really bad with relationships of all kinds - I find it very hard to connect emotionally with people and struggle to generate and keep meaningful relationships with anyone; even my family. Even conventional, 'normal' relationships confuse and tire me. I'm 22, in my final year of university and haven't had a girlfriend here. I'm good looking and girls like me but don't go through the stress of getting with any and haven't brought any back to my house while we've been living together. Maybe he thinks (or hopes) I'm a closet homosexual and am just repressing my feelings? Although I doubt it as me and my other housemates have common conversations about certain celebrities on TV etc. and how we think they're hot.\n\nJust wanted to get this off my chest and ask you guys if I'm being the asshole here.",

    "selftext": "AITA for this situation?\n\nSo this is ongoing and rather annoying. One of my good friends (also a redditor, hello if you\u2019re reading this) and I are in one hell of a dispute and I need help.\n\nBasically, he (lets call him Matt) and a girl (let\u2019s call her Taylor) had dated a few years back, and with Taylor recently being single, they decided to hook up, no strings. I am very good friends with both and heard both sides of the story. Both sets of parents HATE the opposite child, so although they both kind of want to date seriously (Taylor more than Matt), it could never happen. Matt decides after a few weeks that he doesn\u2019t like the risk/reward of the scenario, has been contemplating ending it for a wile and complaining about the situation, and thus decides to call it off. He calls and texts her, and they discuss it, and eventually there is a resolution made: no more hooking up between the two. Now, this is where perspectives begin to vary.\n\nMatt says that Taylor begins at this point to spread rumors about him amongst his and her (therefore my) friends. She tells people that he pushed her into things, and that she wanted to do them but he started it all. She tells people that he promised to eventually take her out, and broke those promises. She tells people he dropped her out of nowhere with no reason. He feels she ruined his life by spreading all of these rumors.\n\nTaylor says that she talked to her friends about the situation, and never spread any rumors maliciously or purposely. Although she was upset at the time of the breaking-off point, and probably dropped a bit more profanity than necessary, she didn\u2019t carry it over. She says she talked to her friends about the situation, but only to figure out what to do and how to handle the situation. He is overreacting a great deal.\n\nAnd of course, as per the old saying, \"there are three sides to a story: his way, her way, and the truth\u201d, there\u2019s what actually happened. From what I\u2019ve gathered, Taylor probably was upset and talked to her friends, who began smaller rumors than Matt describes. Matt did drop her for no reason and very suddenly, but that was part of their deal from the beginning.\n\nAnyway, this relates to the full issue in a major way, I promise. Two weeks later, Taylor and I, who are good friends and have been for longer than I have been friends with Matt, are hanging out and end up making out. We quickly agree that it means nothing and it can happen again, but only if we make sure to stop it if anyone catches feelings or simply doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nNow Matt, who knows that I\u2019m good friends with Taylor, decides soon after to get more than one of my friends together and just absolutely flame me for even being friends with Taylor. Calls her awful things, gets our friends to cautiously do the same (to a lesser extent). Says he\u2019ll kick my ass if I ever do anything with her, gets very annoyed. Mind you, this is after I have committed said \"treachery\". After a day or two of brushing off questions, Matt finds out somehow what\u2019s happened. Cusses me out, gets very upset, continues it over text, eventually degrades to the point that the only thing he\u2019ll say to me is \u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass.\u201d I tried to solve this all very calmly and civilly, but all efforts failed. Matt gets a friend of ours to also text me and take his side, and had I responded, he most likely would have done the same thing that Matt did and not let it go.\n\nMatt and my friends have known Taylor longer than I have, and don\u2019t have a super favorable opinion of her. However, I like and trust her, and I feel they don't give her a fair chance. I get that they tried to give me advice, but ATIA for wanting to make my own decision, or ATIA for what I've done?\n\nThanks Reddit!\n\nTl;dr: Hooked up with someone that my friend had hooked up with and broken it off with recently, then was berated by him and an army of my dear friends.

She's a really cool person so we didn't fear her, we ran up to her and gave her hugs hello. By the end of the night though, my roommate was getting damn close with her and it was pretty obvious she was trying to go back with him. I was shocked to witness such a legend unfold, but my friends started to step in and try to separate them, which I realized was totally a good idea. \n\nMy roommate and I sell pot on campus and he recently made a hallucinogen pickup, so our room was loaded with tons of drugs. We're safe about all that though, so it's never usually anything to worry about. \n\nBy the time we made it back to campus after my RA took a cab with us, my friends who had kept the couple separate had to go home, so I had to take more of an active role. We got him away from her and back to my room, but he was being drunk and unreasonable and kept talking about how he wanted \"to win.\" He rambled on saying how fucking your RA would achieve \"diplomatic immunity\" as a dealer. I argued that such immunity would only last until they stopped fucking and the RA realizes how her job was on the line, when she would likely throw my roommate under the bus to save herself. And if the room ever got searched after this \"diplomatic immunity\" ended, I would become my roommate's cellmate. For a long time. \n\nFed up with his drunk crap, I saw an opportunity to slap him and took it. I hoped it would either slap some sense into him, sober him up a bit, or make him take a step back and think about the situation from another perspective. I continued to try to reason with him but his mind was made, and I was a dick for cockblocking. \n\nAlbeit it would be legendary to fuck your RA, am I unreasonable for expecting my roommate should wait till the last week of the semester, rather than possibly throwing away both of our lives?

    "selftext": "There'll be mostly only one other person (aside from OP) in the story so I think \"I\" will always be the pronoun for me, the OP and \"him\" will mostly be about this one other person.\n\nI have a bi friend who we call Bifriend came out to me when I came out to him. This was around two years ago or so? We used to be high school buddies, then drifted away, then we got to catch up online and sort of came out to each other. We have a completely disjoint set of friends now.\n\nThing is, I'm the only friend he ever came out to. I live in a country where the culture is just starting to accept same sex relationships. So it's still a bit taboo in a sense. But not too taboo.\n\nJust in case he came out to me because he's interested in me, I made it clear that I'm not.\n\nEverything I say onwards happened online now, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAt first, it wasn't yet a burden that he'd exclusively talk to me about guys he likes. It's like 99% of our conversation topics. At first it was fine. But then it gets tiring, since he keeps on sharing of guys I don't know and tells how hot they are. During the first few days, I was fine with it. But then it got old very fast. Especially since we're basically leading different lives now and I'm pretty much disconnected with what he's doing.\n\nI told him this and tried to suggest that he tell other friends (friends that he hangs out with personally these days). This is because (a) I'm not too interested in ogling strangers. (b) I think it's healthier to have someone you see on a personal basis to be some kind of support friend for being bi.\n\nHe holds this belief that he can be happy without coming out to any more people. And I hold this belief that it's always better to at least let your close friends know. So basically, with his principle, I remain the only friend with whom he's out to.\n\nToday, I came to the realization that I am in some way enabling him not coming out to any more people because he can always have someone to talk to. This is because he talked to me about this guy he's getting close with and that he wants to know if he's straight or not and if he's interested. And if he is, hopefully he is also someone who wants to keep to the closet.\n\nMy patience with tolerating this lifestyle grew thin because of the reasons stated above AND because I get stressed thinking that things could be better for him if he came out to other close friends. And so, I told him I'm not comfortable discussing boys with him anymore. He tells me he's not stressed about things.\n\nSo basically, I just implied that we act as if he never told me he was bi. And just discuss things that do not involve his crushes.\n\nHe tells me that he could be happy closeted for an indefinite amount of time. And I feel that I'm the one who's closed-minded because I do not believe that. It may just be a difference in opinions. Or maybe he has his own reasons to stay closeted. But to be on point: **Am I the asshole for refusing to entertain my friend discussing these topics because I don't tolerate his lifestyle?**\n\n---\n\n^(To present an analogy and a potential TLDR, it's like having a friend who keeps on arguing with his SO. Friend doesn't see it as a problem but you know it is. You give advice to said friend. Friend doesn't follow advice. And so the same problem occurs over and over. You get tired of hearing it. And you ban it from coming up in conversation.)\n\n---\n\nAn interesting side discussion would also be that if I'm too closed-minded to not believe that one can be happy closeted to almost all close friends? Or something like that. I dunno. I'm not very eloquent but people might get a good discussion about this.",

Number one, majority rules. If two of us use rain and one uses jet, rain should be the default. Number two, she'd just admitted to using the rain, so my flipping it off of jet is actually doing her the favor.

It doesn't, but it's annoying as hell to reach up and twist the shower head and have the cool water being pushed out go down your arm.

    "selftext": "Hoo boy, this is gonna take some explanation.\n\nMy partner (m/21) 'Allan' and I (m/27) have been in a relationship for the better part of two years now. He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\n\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\n\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\n\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \n\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\n\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \nSo I did something very stupid. \nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \n\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\n\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\n\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\n\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?",

    "selftext": "A little back story: I was taken away by CPS and grandma was deem unfit tfor custody because of her meth addiction. This was back in '99.\nI got into a bit of trouble at age 15, and my adoptive parents gave me back to my grandma and basically said \"you deal with it\".\nI moved from Miss. back to Washington.\nLong story short, I believe grandma has a narcissistic personality. She screamed at me because I \"did the dishes wrong\". There was only a single dishsoap bubble on a plate, and she accused me of trying to make her sick. [Edit] *She* *kicked* *me* *out* *over* *this* *shit.*\nI ended up hooked on drugs at age 16, and I pulled through it all on my own. I moved to Nevada and never looked back.\nIn that time, I had broken contact with grandma several times. I had my daughter last April and decided every great grandma needs to know their great grand child. Im an only grand child, the daughter of an only child, in a long line of women. So this was special to me!\n\nWhen I called grandma, she asked me to move in with her. \"I'll let you live here rent free if you just come here and help me do things around the house and you get a job.\"\n\nI sold my new sporty little Abarth for an 05 CR-V, packed up, and didnt think twice.\nIn two days, I landed a little job selling pot legally. I make $10 an hour and work 8 (ish) hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and I LOVE it.\nBut I stand all day. So I'm ready to relax when I get home... Kick my shoes off..\n\nWell, grandma has cleaned up her drug habit. But now she has a new one.\n\nMethadone.\n\nShe sells them. She abuses them. She stays up all hours of the night pacing, stomping, cleaning, cussing herself out, yelling at the cats. And I'm like.. Dude.. I have work at 9 am? And I just want a moment to kick my feet up...\n\nSo a week passes by, and I'm losing my patience. But I keep quiet. Really quiet. Too quiet for grandma.\nShe would ask \"whats wrong?\" and then chew me out for telling her \"I just dont like the way you talk to me. I just wanna have a normal conversation with my grandma.\"\n\nBy the way, let me add, I gave up yelling when my daughter was born. I didnt like who I had become. And I didnt like seeing my boyfriend that upset because of me. I wanted to be the best mom possible for my girl.\n\nSo on to the shoving part of my story: In only 7 days, I was already a bit frustrated at grandma. But I'm like.. Whatever, water under a bridge. I'll HAVE to sleep eventually.\n \n(back to my real story...)\nGrandma bought a suction cup cat bed that suctions to the window so your special little friends can feel even more entitled. :P\nShe was having trouble putting it together and asked me to help her.\n\nSure! My pleasure! I walk up and see whats wrong immediately.\n\n\"That piece is backwards.\"\n\n\"NO THE FUCK ITS NOT.\"\n\nI'm like,\"okay. Well if you know whats wrong why did you ask for my help?\"\nGenuine question, I wanted to know. No snark, no snobbiness. I asked with an even tone to my voice.\n\n\"FUCK YOU. FUCK OFF.\"\n\nI tell her, \"okay. Then don't ask for my help anymore.\"\n\n\"I WONT THEN.\"\n\n\"K.\" And I went to my room because I had gotten a little frustrated.\n\nGrandma knocks on my door 30 minutes later.\n\"Sweetie, your laundry is done. Do you need help folding?\"\n\n\"No, I got it. Thanks.\"\n\nShe asks me whats wrong.\n\"I just am hurt by the way you speak to me.\"\n\n\"FUCK YOU. YOU DONT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT *FEELINGS*. I CAN TALK TO PEOPLE HOWEVER THE FUCK I WANT.\"\n\nI told her \"I was born with *your* depression so dont tell me I don't know about feelings. And golly gee, do I wish I could talk to people however I wanted. But thats not how life works. And if you keep it up, I dont have to be here to 'help' you.\"\n\nShe started to charge at me and she says \"get the fuck out of my way!\"\nWe are both in the hall by the washer/dryer, I'm by my bedroom door. And Im like,\"I'm not in your way though. I'm like halfway in my room...\"\nAnd grandma shoves me in my chest, both hands. \n\nI got pretty pissed and stomped behind her and said \"if you ever touch me like that again, I have every goddamn right to defend myself.\"\n\nGrandma turns around and has a fist clenched. She took that as a challenge, I guess? \nShe charged at me again, and I shoved her away from me.\n\nGrandma (59 years old and still pretty healthy) fell.\nI ran to my room and called the cops because I was really, truly afraid of her. \n\nBecause grandma fell, I was taken into custody.\n\nAm I the asshole here??\n\n[Edit] Baby is safe and sound in NV with her dad.\nI would never expose my child to that garbage.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "So for some background, I'm a college student from the US who's 19, turning 20 a week from Sunday.  I have your stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother, and I love her, but I think what she did recently is a little out of line but I might just be thinking like a spoiled bitch.\n\nA few months back, I made plans to go to Trinidad with some friends for spring break.  I had the money for the hotel, food, spending, etc. but had a little trouble coming up with the money for the flight when it came time.  I mentioned to my mother that I needed to work a little more to save up the money (I have a pretty well paying and flexible job) and she asks how much, then says she'll just buy me the tickets as a 20th birthday present as the family business is doing well and I've been doing pretty well at school lately.  I said she didn't have to, she insisted, and I was honestly pretty stoked about saving $400.  \n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and once again I'm planning a trip.  A friend from high school and I want to visit his family in Germany for a week in the summer.  I call up my mom to tell her I just bought flight tickets to Berlin in June, and she's furious with me.  I want to pull the \"I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions\" card, but I know that won't go over well, so I instead ask why she has such a big issue with it.  \n\nShe tells me she doesn't think it's safe for my friend and I to travel to Germany just the two of us, because it's so far away, Berlin is a big city and cities have crime, because I'd be \"closer to ISIS\" (what??), and she's not sure if she can \"trust my friend\".  I respond with \"so you're worried about me going to an extremely safe country I'm familiar with, with someone you know well, who I've known for five years.  But you're totally okay with me going to an unfamiliar country with a high crime rate with people you've never met, who I've known for three months?\"  She immediately says \"Well now that you put it that way, maybe I'm not okay with it!\". I decide just to drop it, and figure she'll stop being upset in a few days.\n\nThe next day she calls me and says she wants to refund the tickets.  I tell her that the other two girls going on the trip were relying on me to split the cost of the hotel three ways, and they couldn't afford it if it was just the two of them, and me not going could mess up their travel plans as all the hotels in the area are probably booked up by now.  She essentially says \"tough\" and says that if I'm going to make plans without her approval, I should \"remember who I'm talking to\".\n\nNow the other two girls are pretty upset because they have to either come up with my share of the hotel in a little over a week, or cancel.  I understand that my mom bought the tickets and I'm not trying to be ungrateful, but I did offer to pay, I planned on paying, I never expected her to pay, and saw the tickets as being like a gift. And now that she's decided to pull them from under me, other people's plans have been messed up. \n\nOn the one hand I feel like it was a bit out of line of her, and I'm being treated as a child.  On the other hand, I feel like I'm thinking like an entitled prick.  I really haven't said anything to my mom about it.  We've both been avoiding each other since. \n\n\nEDIT: For clarification, the tickets for Germany were paid for with my own money, not my families.  The only thing bought with my family's money was the plane tickets to Trinidad.",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit, a little over a year ago, I moved into an apartment with two friends (the two friends lived there for about a year before I came in). The apartment has two regular bedrooms and one master bedroom that's much bigger, so whoever lives there pays a larger share of rent for it. We're in the process of finding a new roommate, and my other roommate really wants the room. The problem is, he's currently a month and a half behind on rent as it is, and has no real steady income. At the moment he's an adjunct professor making barely enough to get by on the few classes he teaches (and has no work come summertime), meanwhile I have a pretty steady and larger flow of income. I think I should take the more expensive room in our apartment because of this, but he wants it and is angry that I'm even bringing up the idea of taking it. When one of us is late on rent, it looks bad on everyone, and although he says he'll be caught up on rent by next week, I just don't think his financial situation is good enough for him to be able to handle the extra money that'll come with that room. \nI should also mention that I'm the one carrying the burden of scheduling viewings of the apartment and taking pics/making posts on rental sites. He has done nothing. Reddit, AITA?",

    "selftext": "Let's get some context: We have a 3 bedroom apartment, and we rent the master bedroom out to a roommate. When he moved in, he agreed that he would help to clean the place; said it would  be no problem. \n\nThe master bedroom he lives in has a bathroom. I consider it a half-bathroom and only worth the toilet, sink and storage - BUT it's technically a full bathroom with a stupid shower you can't stand up in. We told him it was cool if he used the common bathroom to shower as long as he helped clean the bathroom, and he agreed. \n\nThe day he moved in, he insisted that he can't use the toilet in that bathroom either (it's an old building built in the 30s so it *is* awkward). We said that we could all share the common area bathroom as long as he helped out with the responsibilities. \n\nMONTHS LATER, ~~he hasn't cleaned anything~~ *edit: in the first 6-7 months he lived with us, he only cleaned the bathroom maybe twice. He himself admits it was \"maybe a few times\".* I clean my bathroom weekly, so we typically cleaned it about 24 times in that timeframe. We'd ask him to clean the bathroom, and then he'd leave the apartment and say he isn't home and can't clean - and he'd never clean it even after he got back. He hasn't helped buy toilet paper. He hasn't bought cleaning supplies. He hasn't taken the trash out. Nothing. We had a discussion about it and talking to him about this frustrated us to the point that he was told to just not worry about it we will deal with it ourselves. \n\nFor the last few months he has lived here, not coming out of his room, not talking to us, not buying toilet paper or cleaning supplies or anything, and not helping to clean the bathroom. But he keep using it, and he's been in that bathroom while we had to get ready for work. \n\nI understand not using the shower in his bathroom, because you have to sit to use it and use a shower head on a hose - it's not great but other roommates have preferred to do that instead of share a bathroom. However, he uses the common bathroom for EVERYTHING- toilet, shower, etc. If he uses his private bathroom it's basically for the sink and for storage. He even leaves all of his shower stuff in the common bathroom even though he has his own bathroom. \n\nNow, he is upset at having to pay so much money in utilities, and he wanted to split it differently. So when he brought up the money he think he shouldn't have to pay, I brought up the fact that WE pay for the toilet paper he has used for 8 months, the fact that we buy cleaning supplies AND clean even though he doesn't, the fact that WE buy the salt and shovels to get our cars out, and the fact that he doesn't help with ANY of that. I don't really care that he doesn't clean the floors or the kitchen because he doesn't use them - he sits around inn his room and in the bathroom. \n\nI brought these things up to him. I don't want to be taken advantage of anymore, and if he wants to split the utilities differently, I want him to either use his own bathroom exclusively or start helping us clean and buy toilet paper for the common area bathroom that he uses instead of his. \n\nHe proceeded to tell me he was doing US a favor, got shitty, and **eventually agreed to clean every third week. (three people living here, bathroom gets cleaned once a week)**. \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\nedit: (I ask because honestly I can't stand his attitude and how he treats us, and if we ask him to leave when the lease is up I want to know that we explored all options.)\n\n\n**tl;rd - 3 people share 1 bathroom. 1 guy doesnt clean, buy cleaning supplies, or buy toilet paper for about 9 months. Cleans bathroom twice. Decides he wants to pay less in utilities and then acts like we're the asshole when we agree to split it differently in exchange him agreeing to clean bathroom every 3 weeks.**",

    "selftext": "First off, an explanation for the quotations around disrespect. The sort of official meaning for disrespect within the smash community is beating somebody while they're already down. For example, someone is knocked off the stage but can't get back on, but then the opponent jumps off and hits them further, basically overkill. However, the meaning of the word has widened significantly over time. \n\nNow for the actual story. I was in a smash tournament, which I won in the end. I actually played the guy who I \"disrespected\" earlier on as-well as in the finals. I knocked him into losers bracket and he got really angry and had to step out for a while. No big, this happens all the time in venues. People get really into the game. After a while we hit the finals and he has won in the losers bracket. I didn't drop a single game up until that point when he beat me. In smash brothers tournaments, we play a set with best out of X amount of games against each person. Think Tennis in a sense. We were doing Bo3 matches throughout including in GF (although many do Bo5 for finals matches). He beat me in the first finals game of the set. Then in the second game he starts out at a lead but I gimp (use a weak move to stop the opponent from coming back to the stage) him which lead to me gaining traction and winning that game. So now we are at 1-1. At this point he was already getting angry and I was getting annoyed at him for getting so angry at a game. \n\nIn the third game, he starts off strong but I take a stock (life) off of him and he can't seem to figure my strategy out. He's playing as Cloud from Final Fantasy 7. Cloud has a special move that is essentially a charge meter you can actively charge. Once charged all the way, your stats are boosted for a while until you use another special move. In Smash Bros tournaments, if there is a time-out where the clock hits 0:00,then the person with more stocks wins the game. \n\nI noticed that I could run down the clock or take another stock from him to close out the game, set, and tournament, but I decided to \"disrespect\" him. instead of trying to come after me, he kept charging his charge meter so I started using taunts(little animations that mostly don't deal damage) to pass the time since I didn't need to go after him and also to, literally, taunt him towards attacking me. \n\nMy opponent didn't want any of that and became verbal in his opinion of my taunts. He called it disrespect even though we were both in the neutral state of game (neither side has a clear positional advantage) and proceeded to quit instead of attack me. I taunted him three times before he quit which led to a very lackluster victory. I didn't see him at all afterwards. \n\n\nI asked some friends about it but they usually have similar opinions as I do, hence why we get along so well. \n\nTldr; Taunted him to me, made him end up committing sudoku\n\nSo, what am I missing, am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses. I've thought about all of them and it seems like those who don't know the smash scene tend to side with me, but those who are big into it do in fact think I'm an asshole. I guess it all came down to the connotation of taunting within a match which is indeed seen as completely immoral to many in the smash community. I don't think I'm the asshole here, but based on the replies here, my opponent's state of mind needs to be thought of as well during a match. ",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 9 months now. We both plan on entering university this year, and there is a big chance of us having to do long distance during our bachelors. I want to pursue dentistry (a five year bachelors plus masters course) because it'll give us a cushy income and I wouldn't have to work as much as a doctor, giving me time to focus on my family. He wants to pursue a mechanical engineering degree (3 years bachelors) and then would like to do a masters (additional 2 years). \n\nThe reason we might have to do long distance is because dentistry in the city we live in is very, very difficult to get in, compared to other nearby cities. I simply do not have the grades to make it in here. He says must stay here, because he can't afford to pay for his mom's rent, as well as his own if he lives somewhere else. I understand this. While I'm still part of the lower class, his family has an even lower financial status than mine.\n\nHis dad sends him money every month for their rent, even though his parents are divorced. His mom lives off of this money, as well as the government. She only works 8 hours a week because she goes to mandatory language school, and already has quit one job because the hours were too long. She has had rheumatoid arthritis for ten years. She quit another job, where she would work for 18 hours, because she didn't like her coworkers and the job didn't fit in her time schedule. You see, even with her working 18 hours, her son could have pursued an education anywhere else (not necessarily with me, of course, but to places with a better program).\n\nHis mom has to go to school for around a year, and by law is required to then pursue another job so that she wouldn't have to live off of the government forever. That means in around a year, she MUST find a better paying job to support herself, first of all, and then her son. If she doesn't, she has to pay a hefty fine.\n\nI get that we have to do long distance for his bachelors. But, after a hypothetical four years of being together, I'd trust that he would want to move out of his mom's house and move in with me. He could find a job, or he could work, whatever floats his boat. If he were to pursue a master's, his mom would HAVE to earn more (by the law) and could support him even better than she can now.\n\nTo be honest, my boyfriend could go pursue his bachelors somewhere else already. His mother just refuses to find another job, even though he's tried to talk to her about their finances. They can barely pay their bills, but his mom has been saying that she's going to pass away soon for the past 10 years and lives her life like it's her last year. I understand that she has a really bad illness, but she's been living recklessly for the past 10 years and she's still alive. She can still work, and has a lot of time on her hands. My boyfriend doesn't want to confront her, because she can be a bit abusive at times. I'm just going to blame that on the pain caused by the arthritis.\n\nAnyways, I told my boyfriend that after his bachelors, I would not like to do long distance any longer. 3 years is already a long time, and I'm already the type of person who was never going to pursue a long distance relationship again. He says we might have to do long distance for 5 years, and I'm just not willing to wait that long. He keeps making up excuses for why he might not be able to move in with me after 3 years (for example, he may not be able to find work, he might find a better masters program elsewhere, etc). Heck, he's making up excuses not to leave his mom now. My stance is, there's never a good time to move in together, there's never a good time to get married, and there's never a good time to have kids. He keeps making up excuses, now and for the future, and I'm really turned off by it. Am I being the asshole?",

    "selftext": "So for general context, I live in a house with two roommates. It's fairly small, and the walls are pretty standard student housing fare (thin with little to no insulation, leading to almost any amount of noise carrying through the whole house). A few weeks ago, my roommates complained that my computer was too loud at night (completely  reasonable complaint on their part, I thought I had it quiet enough but misjudged how shitty the insulation was), so I responded by apologizing and started carefully policing the volume after they went to bed, and keeping it at the level I thought it originally had to be at earlier to keep it a reasonable volume. This only really came about because I'm a total night owl (usually going to bed around 11:30-12:00), whereas my roommates both go to bed around 10:00 on a regular night. A couple of the nights that my volume was too loud, my girlfriend was staying over, so the roommates now associate her with the loud volume, which in my opinion is unfair to her, considering that my habits are the same whether she's home or not, and I honestly try even harder to keep things quiet when she's around because I recognize the burden that having an extra person around can be, especially in a small place.\n\nAs for the specific situation that most recently occurred, this morning I had to leave my girlfriend at home while I went to school, because she is too sick to be attending classes (she currently can't talk without extreme pain, and is basically living off of throat lozenges and cough syrup). Obviously leaving her alone isn't normal or ideal, but I wasn't about to ask her to leave the house, considering if I were in her place I would be sending myself to a clinic to get checked out (she's the \"I'll just suffer until my body beats it\" type). Before class, one of the roommates sent me a text complaining that my girlfriend was home, and said that she's \"overstaying her welcome\". I responded by explaining that she was sick, and the roommate responded that \"this situation is fine, but you need to respect the house more\"\nI know I've been an asshole in the past (the noise situation), but in my opinion I deserve some respect as well and the roommates have been unfairly putting the burden on me. All three of us deserve to have a degree of comfort in the house, and to me I feel that they take their comfort at my expense just as often as the other way around, without acknowledging our differing lifestyles and differing needs.\nI don't really care whether the roommates are assholes or not (either way I'm stuck with them for another couple of months due to my lease), but I don't think I'm an asshole.

I asked the friend who seemed less bothered by my stay, if I  can stay 1 more night / explained the story.  He responded with a \"hey, how about asking ____ (other friend)?\" \n\nI'm now too embarrassed to even ask the other friend.  AITA?  Making me homesick for the first time, as I know I have about 6 friends back home who this would be ZERO problem for and vice-versa.

    "selftext": "The title is just a segue into the main story. My brother came home from university for easter and left today. As i was about to leave for work this morning\nhe came from his room and asked me to quickly drive him to our dads to pick up a pair of shoes before he goes to the bus station. I said \"No problem but I have to drop you off at the corner (2 blocks west of the subway that goes to the bus station) because Im taking (little brother) to school.\"\nSo we go to our dads, and he picks up his shoes. then he starts trying to convince me to drive him to the subway station because \"it will be so much easier\". keep in mind\nthe subway station is 2 blocks east, there is morning traffic and it would make our little brother late for school. His bus is in an hour, and it takes at most 20 minutes to get there from the subway station. So i stop at the corner at a red light for him to get out. I say \"ok ill stop here so you can get out\",\nand he sort of snaps at me to at least grab his bag from the back seat (we are in a fiat too by the way, close quarters.). Then the light turns green and i sort of snap back \"Get out the lights green!\" So he grabs his back quickly and punches me as he leaves, calling me a selfish asshole.\nThis really pissed me off. So pissed I wanted to run over the biker in the bicycle lane next to me. All weekend I ran around for him.\nI let him use my computer to write a paper since he forgot his charger. Did i get a thank you when i asked for it back when he was done? No, when i asked to have it back, I got a snappy \"One sec!\" as he surfed Facebook. Eventually i just grabbed my laptop out of his hands. Did i get a thankyou when he asked my to drive him to the subway to go play soccer, which is about a 20 minute drive away (on easter sunday)? No, i got complaints that I wouldn't drive him all the way to soccer, and a sales pitch on taking him all the way there instead of just to the subway. Finally I gave in and drove him all the way there.  \n\nSo, naturally I called my dad just to vent a bit. A few minutes later I get a text from him saying I deserved to get punched since the way I told him to get out of the car wasn't nice. He told me to stop acting like a 12 year old and tattling on dad. I responded saying I'll stop being a 12 year old when you stop acting like a baby with a tantrum when he doesn't get his own way,\nand called him out on acting incredibly selfish all weekend. He then responded with an essay of a text saying how I never ask him about himself and how I don't do anything unless it benefits me.  \n\nI pointed out how on facebook (our main medium of talking, since we live 2 hours from eachother)\nI have initiated every conversation, sharing something interesting or funny with him, asking him when he's home next etc.\nAnd the last time he started a conversation was in February asking me to send him money. (my dad gives him ~1300 a month - he went through a thousand in 2 days this past week paying off bets he lost and buying himself new pants) \"Yea, im so selfish didn't give you the opporunity to talk about yourself. \" I say.  \n\nTL;DR: I drive my brother around town since he cant drive. I let him use my computer to write a paper. I take him to pick up his shoes last minute. He punches me for burdening him with a 2 block trip  he can either walk or go by streetcar. Calls me an asshole for never asking him about his life. I do talk to him a lot, but its not good enough I guess until I ask him about his life. meanwhile he only initiates conversation when he needs money.",

    "selftext": "Two weeks ago I've started going to the dentist. Without going into exactly why, I've been told that except for one tooth, all my teeth will have to be pulled. Naturally I'm not thrilled about it. I'm only 28, and in addition to that I've developed bald spots and have been struggling with depression. In addition to that I'm not great around strangers, so going to the dentist is already unpleasant to me (pain not withstanding). After I got my first appointment I messaged my dentist over viber to confirm the date and time. She is my age and seemed rather friendly. We talked for a bit after that about random things and joked around. I knew she was married and I personally didn't find her attractive even though objectively I consider her pretty. I made some (in hindsight) possibly inappropriate jokes, but she didn't react negatively at the time. In fact, the next day she told me how much she had to hold back not to laugh too loud and wake her infant daughter. We talked maybe once or twice after that, but not nearly as long. Fast forward a few days later, I'm in the waiting room. She opens the door and tells me to come inside. As I step in I see a guy standing in the room. I'm thinking he's leaving as I'm going in and don't think much about it. I start taking my jacket off and the guy sits down (There's chairs for when she's taking a break in the room, it's separate from the waiting room). Already I'm confused. She tells me to lay down on the weirdly shaped dentist  hair. A thousand thoughts rush through my head. \"What is she doing? Is she gonna pull my teeth in front of that random stranger?\" I'm not feeling comfortable at all about this, but she just casually gives me the anesthetic. As soon as she's done injecting it she starts talking with the guy. I turn around and see him reading patients files. She tells him not to do that,  while smiling and giggling. He just looks at her and smiles back. I'm completely lost and raging inside. She walks back to me and pulls a tooth out, then essentially rushes me out. As I'm putting my jacket on she asks the guy if the bleeding stopped. It's at this point that I realize he's just a patient who decided it's OK to be present during my appointment and read private information about other patients. A few hours after arriving home I message my sister, describing what happened and asking for advice. She agrees with me that what she did was not alright. I message her about rescheduling the next appointment for a different day, but she says that she has no more spots left for that day. \"Can we not have moronic spectators the next time?\" I ask. \"That moron is my cousin. Yeah, no problem, cya monday\" she replies. I'm still pretty pissed off at this point, thinking I don't care who he was, he's not supposed to be present. But I leave it at that. The next day I start feeling bad about it, despite knowing i did nothing wrong, and decide to apologize to her. She says it's fine, not an issue and she'll see me Monday. Today I arrive at my appointment just as she opens the door. She seemed like she didn't notice me, not really looking at me, but as she closes the door she tells me to come in. I go inside and there's a woman sitting at the same spot her cousin was, but she bends down to her and whispers something, at which point the woman gets up and goes to sit down in the waiting room. She tells me to lay down and I do. I ask her if she's alright, and she says she's great. I ask her if she's angry and she says we'll talk. \"Alright, this isn't going to be pleasant. She's clearly pissed and about to stick a needle in my gums\" is what's going through my head. She sort of harshly sticks the needle in my gums and then says \"listen, I'm a dentist, you're my patient. You have stepped out of the line with your jokes. You personally insulted me. What if it was a doctor sitting there? Would you want me to throw them out, too?\" I reply that I would be fine if another doctor was present, but not some random guy. She continues with \"I've been more than nice to you. From now on I'm going to a dress you with sir and there will be no more messages. That man was my brother (even though she said it was her cousin, now she says it's her brother). Pulling teeth isn't  $2000 (not sure why she brought that up, she just randomly did) alright?\" I say yeah, alright. She pulls 2 teeth and sends me home.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to make sure I explain the situation properly. I feel like she brought up the jokes because I called her cousin an idiot, and not because she took issue with them, although I would understand if she did even though I considered them harmless at the time. As uncomfortable as I felt before about going to the dentist, it's 10 times worse now. I'm worried she's not gonna give a shit if I'm in pain or not.",

I tip 15% for mostly everything - restaurants, hairdressers, taxis, nail salon, my tattoo artist. I have rarely, if ever, tipped more than 15%. If I order something for takeout and I'm just picking it up I'll tip 10%. If I'm just grabbing a coffee I'll put my spare change in the tip jar and I tip about $1 per beer at a pub. We Canadians are pretty polite, so even if I got pretty bad service I would still tip 15% (rarely has that happened to me). Recently I was having a conversation with some of my friends and they said that tipping 18% is actually what is considered normal, and 20% for exceptional service. They said 15% was not that great, bordering on rude. Is this true?

In early March I contacted a freelance woodworker on Craigslist who said that they could make a desktop to match my specifications (6' x 18'\" x 1\"). This is what happened:\n\n-I very explicitly stated that before moving forward, I wanted to know how much the piece of wood would cost. They said, \"It kinda of depends on how long it will take to sand it down. As it is now $60.\" They asked me if I wanted a gloss coat, and I said yes. They said it would be ready in early April.\n\n-I contacted them today asking how the progress was going and they said it would be ready by Monday. I asked them how much the total cost would be. Given the only amount of money they had disclosed to me cost-wise was $60, I assumed it wouldn't deviate too much from that. Instead, they were asking for $300 (all for a 6' x 18'\" x 1\" piece of wood). \n\n-I said: \"I see. You said in an earlier message that it would be around $60-$100. If you look at the initial messages I sent you on March 10th, you stated that. Was there something I missed?\"\n\n-They said: \"I said 60 for the 6 by 18 as it was, Without any work put into it. Then I asked if you wanted it sanded and glossed it would all depend on how many hours was put into it and the quality of the finished product. If you buy any type of wood for furniture and it is a finished product it will be pricey not to mention custom made.\"\n\n-I said: \"Clearly I have never  bought anything of this sort before, I feel like an idiot. It would have been nice to have had a final price estimate based upon what I asked for, but that was my fault for not being explicit.\"\n\n-They said: \"I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.\"\n\n-It went back and forth like this, and I argued that they should have been straightforward with their pricing, while they argued that I should have asked all the questions I could before allowing them to go off and prepare the wood.\n\n-Since I didn't sign a contract, I told him I simply couldn't afford it and cut all contact.\n\nIt all just seems very strange to me; what kind of businessperson withholds pricing info and then goes off to make the product without knowing that the customer will be willing to pay the final amount? Should I have asked more questions, or should they have been more transparent about their pricing?\n\nAm I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "So about six or 7 years ago I decided to take over cooking and shopping duties for my household of 5.  Long before I took over, and for a few years after, the grocery store had your [traditional style checkout stands]( http://i.imgur.com/zpUTnLW.jpg) where the cashier would take your items from the first conveyor (which you typically loaded yourself), scan them, then place them on a second conveyer that would go to a bagger at the end of the stand who would then load your cart.  Practically every lane with the exception of the express lanes was set up like this.  \n\nA couple of years back the grocery store took out the old stands and replaced them with these updated ones that removed the traditional bagger\u2019s area and replaced them with the carousel-style bagging system you typically see at [self-checkouts]( http://i.imgur.com/cx29l8J.jpg).  I suppose you could describe it as a [hybrid of the two stands]( http://i.imgur.com/wgiNaWm.jpg), and though no one comes right out to say it, the intent seems clear to me; They want you to bag your own groceries.  \n\nThere are maybe 1-2 baggers/runners on shift at the time and day I go, when there used to be about one to every lane.  When they were first installed, it was a nightmare.  Lines were stacked up further back than I had ever seen, customers were upset with the new system and many were not afraid to complain to any employee that would listen.  In the time since they were first installed it has gotten a little bit better, though not as fast as it was before, and I am still not having it. \n\n I don\u2019t mind loading my own cart, but I am not going to stand there and bag the groceries when there are plenty of other grocery stores in the area (even ones owned and operated by the same company) that don\u2019t have these new stands.   Every time I shop I play a waiting game with the cashier; who is going to flinch first and start bagging the groceries?  Not I.  I look over to the next lane and see some little old lady bagging her own groceries, and I know others are looking at me and thinking \u201cLook at this asshole, if she can do it, why can\u2019t you?\u201d  My feelings are not that this little old lady should be bagging her own stuff and I shouldn\u2019t, but that neither one of us should, nor should the judging eyes.  And until the store tells me their intent is for me to bag my own stuff, I\u2019ll keep playing this little game to see who gives in first.  \n\nUpdate:  The tribe has spoken and I am indeed the asshole, and possibly Larry David.  Upon recommendation, I have contacted the store to find out what their official intent is with the new stands, and I'll give them a direct opinion about them after they get back to me.  That said, I'll probably continue to be the asshole, sorry, but I think I'd have to go to magic school and learn slight of hand before I could separate that stack of bags properly.  \n",

That is the extent of me being an asshole in this post. I hope you'll agree.\n\nLast week I was invited to an event, a dance, by my ex's roommate. I broke up with my ex two months ago after about a month of fighting about me being insensitive and her being too sensitive. On top of that she wouldn't really participate with me in the things I thought interested us anymore. This was all exacerbated by my leaving the country and her having pregnancy scare. Regardless, we break up because I thought she didn't care much anymore. But she cried so immediately I regretted it.\n\nA week after that we go out for coffee and I tell her I want to get back together. She tells me we need time and not to get my hopes up. I don't give it time. The amount of fury in my head forces me to start an argument. And so a relatively civil break up turns into a post break up fight. As per usual with me. We aren't friends, we don't really talk. There's a major coldness between us that I now wish wasn't there. I asked if we had a chance and she said she didn't think there were romantic feelings between us anymore. I told her I wanted to reconcile the friendship. I understand how she doesn't believe me.\n\n\nSo the question is this. It's been two months since we broke up and I'm seeing someone new. The new girl knows the situation completely. My ex isn't seeing anyone of course. She's a very innocent girl I think and she won't date someone she doesn't have an extreme connection with. I invite the new girl to the dance and honestly I wasn't expecting my ex to be there but I knew it was possible. \n\nShe shows up. I didn't totally expect her to. Like I said one of the reasons we broke up is that she would never get out with me. We even dance. She's says something critical about me. I try to be normal with minimal success because we even get into a minor argument there. It wasn't about the relationship but I could tell there was some bad blood between us. I left early with the new girl and I felt extremely rude about it. I don't know if my ex even saw us leave together but I know how bad I would feel to watch my ex leave with another guy. Like I said it just doesn't seem like she would care anyway. It wasn't to make her jealous that I brought the new girl in the first place, but by the end of the night I wanted nothing more than for my ex to see me leave with her. Did I go too far?",

    "selftext": "OK, so the story is this:\n\nMy aunt and I have had an argument over the past few days about a situation where guests will be staying with me in the house. A bit of context: I live downstairs in a studio-style flat - so basically bedroom and living room all in one. I pay my aunt money to stay there, and it's always been assumed that whole space is mine (by all parties involved in this) because I pay board for it and it is completely separate from the rest of the house.\n\nNow, up until a few days ago, this situation was fine. Then she springs onto me that I will need to have guests staying with me mid-week and will be setting up a bed downstairs in my living room. I work full-time and I'm usually out of the house by 7am.\n\nI say 'no', because of this. Her response was 'well, too bad, I'm putting the bed down there regardless of whatever you say'. Never mind that I would have been fine with it if it was on the weekend.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I return home to find that my entire flat had been rearranged, *which I had locked up before leaving*, to have a bed smack-bang in the middle of the living room.\n\nWe had quite an argument about this. Some nasty things were said on both sides. She threatened me with eviction just because I wouldn't bow on this matter, and used the line 'This is my house, it's my rules, you will do this, whether you like it or not'. In the past if we had extra guests they would stay in the dining room in the main part of the house, but this situation has changed for some reason. She used examples like 'well, you listen to music at 1am (which I haven't done in weeks), so I'm sure it's fine'.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to say 'yes' in the end, and I'm less than happy about it, because her partner, who actually owns the place, put his foot down and said 'My roof, my rules, and I say you let them stay down there, and it'll be like this from now on - I might have people stay down there from time to time and there's nothing you can do about it'.\n\nSo, guys, am I the asshole in not backing down because of this, having a reasonable expectation of privacy in my own personal space?\n\n**EDIT - 11/04/16**: so, two things happened. First I got offered a new place to stay by one of the real estate agents I applied to on the weekend, and I move this weekend. Second, the guests ended up not staying; they changed their plans to go out with my uncle (aunt's brother) for dinner and stay with him instead, so turns out that argument was all for nothing!\n\nThanks guys for your answers and advice, it really did help.",

We were both pretty nerdy, so we were both rather shy.\n\nSadly, I didn't get to talk to her as much because of marching band practices after school. But after a while, whenever I would get to see her, I noticed she was really stressed. I mean REALLY stressed, to the point of her hair thinning and such. She was smart, so I didn't think it was just school.\n\nThen she told me a story of her father getting angry and she ended up being shoved into the stove, bruising her hip pretty badly (she was naturally thin). Of course, I expressed my concerns for her health but she kind of brushed it off. I kept noticing things that looked and sounded like she was being abused by her father.\n\nEventually, I just had to do something. I hated seeing her so stressed and hurt. I went to a teacher I trusted and told him the situation, and encouraged me to go to the guidance counselor, which I did right then. This was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable for me, way outside of my comfort zone.\n\nWhen I had mentioned telling someone about her issue, she got kind of angry at me. But here I was, telling a counselor about her signs of stress and bruises and such. I did make sure to say I never was 100% sure there was abuse, but signs pointed to it. I was told they'd bring her in and talk to her.\n\nThen the next day comes. I'm nervous all day because I knew she was going to be asked about it. After school... Yeah. She was very upset with me.

When we do finally meet her I found her to be just plain socially awkward in a rude type of way. I put this down to nerves as it was the first time she'd met us and was told by my friend that we were pisstakers (we are, but good natured). \n\nTurns out, it wasn't down to nerves.

I was convinced I gave it back to him, and he had vague memories of this happening too. I couldn't find the game and told him so at a dinner (with a bunch of other friends), she barked at me \"maybe you should look harder!\"\n\nThen we were away for a weekend at my dad's place by the beach. She was a bit of a nightmare. She annoyed the shit out of me and I felt she was picking on my girlfriend a bit. My girlfriend is shy and doesn't always join in on conversations unless there's an obvious way in. We were playing a card game which involved shouting things and somehow my girlfriend won, this girl says \"How does she win? she never says/does anything\"\n\nThen we play mini-golf.

She gets very upset, says I deceived her, and that she would not have hooked up with me if she knew. So I guess, am I an asshole for not telling her beforehand?",

(Call him John) On a night out we both admitted that at school we had crushes on one another, but that was six years ago, and we had a laugh about it.  \nOne night John had been in a fight with his girlfriend, and kissed me. I was in a relationship too, and told him that I understood he was upset, but not to do that again.  \nA few months later, I'd broken up with my boyfriend. One of our other friends (Matthew) and I got together, but wanted to keep it quiet. John saw me kiss Matthew (we thought we were being sneaky) and I assume he thought I was up for it with anybody? He kissed me and again I told him I wasn't interested.  \nMatthew and I have been together for six months now, and everybody knows. Him and John are really good friends, and he's spoken to John about respecting boundaries, as John has a habit of trying it on with girls who are in relationships.  \nLast night a group of us (including Matthew) were at a friend's house. We were all fairly drunk. I left the main room to get a drink, and John followed me. He pushed me against a wall and kissed me. When he released me, I wordlessly punched him in the face and it transpires that I broke his nose.  \nAm I the asshole?

He is who I consider my first friend, met in kindergarten and we still talk now (we're in, let's say... early highschool).  Now, lately he acts really weird over really stupid shit.  The latest example is that I wanted to have some of the guys over, so I decided to make a group chat.  One of them told Billy abt the chat and he told me to add him.  I told him there was no chat.  The last time I told him he couldn't hang out with us when I had some other guys over he didn't let me live it down for a month.  I would've invited him, but he can get pretty hostile, and my mom doesn't exactly like him from the few times she met him.  So I didn't say a word about what we're talking about, and neither did anyone else to him, but suddenly he pulls this \"why do you hate me,\" \"fuck you\" kind of shit, and I'm just like \"what the fuck I didn't do shit.\"  The next day he acted as if nothing happened and just skyped with me.  I try not to talk to him as much as we would've used to cause' he pulls that kind of shit on me all the time and it's just really annoying.  I feel like I'm being reasonable, but everyone else thinks I'm an ass for it.  I dunno.  \nI feel like I worded this shit badly aswell, but whatever.\nSo reddit, I have 2 questions, AITA, and what should I do - be distant and kinda try and stop hanging out, or try something different?\n\nEdit: My friends kind of act the way i do too, with like... I don't know how to explain.  They could've added him to the chat, but they didnt.  The one that told him about the chat then was telling me/us (in the group chat) about how \"he's special,\" you know what I mean? And what else was I supposed to do?  I kind of felt that the white lie was the best way to go because of how sensitive and hostile he can be... I don't know.  I can see why I'm the asshole here though, but at the same time I feel like I'm not.  Whenever I try talking to him about this kind of crap he just gets angry and goes \"what are you talking about, I never do that.\"  idk",

    "selftext": "Hey reddit, this is my first time posting so please let me know if anything needs reformatting and I'll be more than happy to edit.\n\nSo here's the deal. I have been married for  coming up on five years. My husband is great, he does a lot of really good things for me, but he has never held a job longer than 6 months. He gets bored or frustrated and jumps ship, often without having lined up another job first. The problem is he's very smart and very charismatic and knows he can easily land a new job so he's just fallen into this habit where he assumes he'll never have problems getting another job. He also gets waaaaay too enthused at the start of the job and basically throws all his energy into that honeymoon period. Then he gets worn out, bored, disappointed and quits.\n\nFor example, at this latest job he was brought in as an assistant manager and promised his own store within 3 months. He would come in early, stay late, volunteer to work on his days off, etc and most pay periods he was racking up 80 hours per week. He's salaried, so he's not seeing a dime of over time. On top of that his coworkers are kind of assholes, they consistently show up late, call out, make basic mistakes, etc. So I get it, his job is super shitty. The company just offered him his own store and he put in his two weeks notice - before he even had an interview lined up else where. Now he's starting a new job in a business he'd already tried once before.\n\n\nI've gotten on his case about this several times before in the past, and pointed out to him that there is no consistency here, we can't plan for our retirement like this, I can't go back to school if he's not working, blah blah blah. I hate listening to myself harp on him because I do understand his job sucks - I really don't want to be that bitch wife who's making coming home after a stressful day at work even more stressful. On the other hand I am stressing the fuck out. I have never worked a job for any less than three years. I am miserable in my current job, it's no where close to the industry I want to be in. I am struggling to motivate myself to go into work, but I still have to because I know I can't count on his job and I'm not qualified to go and get a different job elsewhere because I don't have a degree. I constantly feel like I'm getting shafted because he just flits from job to job. I honestly really resent him for this.\n\n\nThere's a lot of other factors playing into this situation as well. I have an expensive hobby that I usually keep myself amused with - he does not. I have taken several weekend trips because of my hobby, he has not. He's made a couple of big ticket purchases without consulting me that I' freaked out over (and admittedly did not handle well at the time of). No body is innocent here.\n\n\nAnyways I feel like a colossal asshole for getting on him about the job situation all the time and for telling him that I think I'm getting the raw end of the deal - he gets to quit his job whenever, but I don't. It's fine if I'm overreacting, I'd just like to stop second guessing myself, I don't have the energy to battle myself and battle him all the time.",

    "selftext": "AITA \nSo there are four of us who live in a four bedroom flat, three guys and one girls. We rushed into renting the flat as we were a bit desperate and so three of us didn't view the property before moving in. (Should note that we were all friends before moving in together). Since we didn't all view the place, we all agreed to pay the same amount of rent each month. The rent equals a substantial amount of our income.\nThe girl flatmate has a boyfriend who, at the beginning of the year, stayed the night on average three nights a week. We were fine with that since he was a guest and bought his own food and we got on with him really well. However, it got to the point recently that he was living with us five or six days a week, sometimes seven.\nHe suggested paying a share of the bills already, which we accepted.\nHowever the three guys (me included) now feel that he is here so much that he should pay a share of the rent, not an equal five split since he doesn't have a key and isn't on the tenancy agreement, but at least something.\nOur logic is that if you live somewhere that isn't your parents; you pay for it (the same as us).\nWe tried to sit them down and have a flat discussion in a mature way and voice our concerns. However, the boyfriend and our flatmate don't agree with this at all and think that him paying bills is enough since he stays out of our way most of the time and is just paying for what he uses. We countered that by saying that by that logic, if we stopped using anything in the flat we would still have to pay rent. It's all blown up and now the boyfriend feels really unwelcome (not our intention) and has moved back home. Also, our flatmate is really upset with us and feels like we ganged up on her boyfriend.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: to include the fact that he has had his mail delivered to the flat before and we have been requested to collect it for him",

    "selftext": "So I'm now a sophomore in high school and I met this guy, let's call him Bob(I'm a guy too and this is just a friend shit no fucking homo, we both have had gfs in high school), in mid freshmen year and we became good friends. I'd say as good friends as you can be w/o being best friends. We had our little group and we all hung out a lot, especially as the weather became warmer. As our sophomore year began everything was still good. Then we just stopped hanging out after school, only talked in group chats n stuff. Still good friends in school tho. Winter break comes along and we didn't talk much. We come back to school in January and suddenly Bob is acting differently. Then a few days later in lunch he was a bit of a duck, was very aggressive with his words and threw stuff. At this time I didn't think anything was wrong so I just brushed it off, no harm done bro! Then the next day he does it again. Then for another week he keeps doing this, lunch is the only time I see him in school btw. So after these 2 weeks I'm done with his shit. I fight back, and I fight dirty, literally too. There were never any fists involved but if he did something to me I did the same shit back and I'd 1 up him. He threw a grape at me? I threw 2! He then would continue with 2 as well but he would throw them after he squished them. Then this went on and on until the janitor came to pick up the lunch trays, does this every day around 30 min after lunch started this is not a special occurance. Then in February he begins to spread rumers about me, still Idk why. The \"fights\" got worse and worse. It just became the norm to do this every day. I almost punched him in the face in multiple occasions, and I'm sure vise vesa. All this continued until late February when I decided to just stop talking to him. Every way I could I just would not respond. Our little group fell apart and now the groups never hangs out, we didn't in winter because, obviously, it was cold. I became real good at ignoring him, and I meant REALLY good. In lunch there's only 4 of us in the table and once he caught on in around mid March only 1 of us is ever in a conversation. If he's telling a story to the table its to everyone but me, because I wouldn't listen. If it was funny I didn't laugh. If there were questions to be asked it wasn't from me. Now in late April I haven't talked to him in months and its getting kinda warm finnaly, live in Chicago, so our old group would had started to hang out after school already, but haven't, and I think its because of our fallout. Should I do something to get our group back to getter, put everything behind us and just act \"normal\"?I fell like I can't and I know he won't. Should I ask him why he changed? Am I the asshole because I stopped taking to him first and kinda ruined the entire group? Or is it him because he just changed in January first?\nEdit: I really am not a homophobe sorry I came out that way.\n\nEdit 2: I talked to him, or at least I tried to talk to him. So after lunch the 4 of us go to 2 classes that are next to each other. I got the 2 other friends to leave from lunch early to get to next period. Since Bob is obviously not just gana sit alone for a few minutes he comes too. I'm talking on the way there and so he isn't and when we get close to the rooms I finish the conversion  as fast as I could. I turn around and say (now thinking about it, it might have looked like I was trying to gang up on him since the other 2 friends, who were ALWAYS mutual, were behind me)\" look Bob, I don't know if I'm sorry(poor choise of words I think) or if you're sorry for all that has happened between us in 2016 but I-\" he cuts me off and said \" wtf are you doing?( with a face of disgust) I liked this whole not talking thing\"(with a circular hand gesture) and walks away. My friend said he was about 5 minutes late to class, 5 minutes between classes too. So I turn back around and the bell rings. I say \"what was that reaction?\" The two of them confused and ask why I did what I did. I say \" I thought I was over all this stupid shit we were doing, and I thought he would be tired of it too\" one says \" yea you two are never gana be friends again\", the other agrees. I just become all serious, and walk into class. Bob talked to people in the few periods left in that day but after school be hasn't responded to anyone's texts. Not even his crush's. And I have not sent any to him I haven't even seen him since this \"incident\". I guess I'm never gana be friends with him again? Did I do something stupid again? I went about this wrong didn't I?",

She gets on these different kicks about different things, usually she drops it after awhile, but there's one thing she's been extremely concerned about as long as I've known her: black pepper consumption.\n\nAccording to my (dear, sweet) grandma, black pepper is a major contributor in everything from high blood pressure to tooth decay. Plus, according to her she \"hates\" it.\n\nNow, she's a really, really picky eater in general, beyond this. Although I am an extremely health-conscious cook, and actually have some professional restaurant/cooking skills, she is very rarely happy with the food I make because some flavor or texture or ingredient displeases her.\n\nOne area that has traditionally proven troublesome is my burgers. Burgers are one of the few things I can consistently get her to eat (she won't touch lamb, pork, rabbit, any unusual poultry, etc), but she always complained about my burgers \"not tasting right\" or \"not having enough flavor\". Until recently that is...\n\nRecently my mother (her daughter-in-law) clued me in to the fact that the reason grandma always tells me she likes my mom's burgers the best of anyone in the family is because she (my mom) puts black pepper in them and doesn't tell her. At first I was astonished, but then after another round of burger complaints (I eat lunch with my grandma 1-2 times a week and I usually cook, so you can imagine how tired I get of this) I decided \"fuck it\" and put black pepper in the burgers.\n\nNow I've been consistently just cooking with black pepper the way I normally would, and guess what, she likes EVERYTHING I cook better now! It's great to finally make her happy(-er) with my food but I kind of feel bad about lying to her about this. Am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR:** AITA for feeding my grandma black pepper when she's convinced that it is bad for you, even though she likes my food way better when I leave it and say nothing?",

And I'm not walking him in the morning which is obviously fine since mum scheduled it for me?\n\n**Sister:**\nThe only part directed at you personally was that you should take him in the morning because that would solve the problem. If you don't want to take him in the morning find another solution\n\n**Me:**\nYou can pick up some poop. We all had to clean up {Other sister}'s messes.  I vaccuumed and mopped the whole house, {unrelated sister} did all her dishes.  You can pick up some poop.\n\n**Sister:**\nMums clearly said that to make your life easier but it means he'll poop in the yard\nI did!!\nAnd I walked him. Just to help out. I actually wasn't even going to say anything  until sh*t hanging over the fence pushed me over the edge.\n\n**Me:**\nI'm walking him at night and at the most I'll pick it up at the end of the week. If it bothers you, you can pick it up sooner.\n\n**Sister:**\nIf he was walked properly none of this would happen. I'm happy to walk him in the mornings when I'm here\nThat's disgusting and you know it. But you can deal with it cos I can't deal with your attitude\n\n**Me:**\nDon't say \"properly\" when I'm doing what the people who own the dog have asked.\n\n**Sister:**\nIt's still not properly\n\n**Me:**\nIt is poop it can handle staying in the grass for a while\n\n**Sister:**\nI just explained why.\n\n**Me:**\nI don't care.\n\n**Sister:**\nClearly\n\n**Me:**\nYou don't own th edog\nI am walking the schedule that was given to me\nYou can cry about it all you want\n\n**Sister:**\nSo?

Later that day I see him doing Lat Pull downs and he is doing quarter reps. So I ask him why he isn't doing the full motion, being curious due to being a novice in the gym. His reaction was to tell me to fuck off and not speak to him again. It legitimately escalated immediately to that. Eventually time passed and one day my training partner and I were doing leg press and had our water bottles next to it. Like most people, as observed and I would assume, we stand next to it when we where waiting on the other one. He comes into the gym and goes to the dead lift platform, which is next to the leg press. After a set I go to stand up and see that he is walking towards me, I assume he is going to get some weights, so I begin to walk out of the narrow aisle so I can stay out of his way. As I am doing so, without adequate time to fully remove myself, he insists on yelling \"Get the fuck out of my way\". I just think this is his way of fulfilling whatever grudge he has against me. Sorry for asking why you were doing a movement a certain way, one time, after you critiqued me. Any way his fit was followed by him preceding to go over and tell a guy right behind me, while I had a headphone slightly off my ear, that when I left the gym he was going to fight me and jump me in the parking lot. Now being in what I thought was a \"Christian Family Facility\" as I walked out that night I thought the appropriate thing to do is to tell the front desk, hey, pretty sure somethings about to go down. They tell me to go see the administrator and I tell him the above story and he walks outside with me as I leave. Nice of him I suppose. Anyway within the next few days he approaches me and says he talked to the guy. Then he proceeds to tell me that everything has been taken care of and if anything happens again just to come see him. After a few days I walk into the gym and as I walk by a mirror like any sane bodybuilder I look in it and slightly flex my tricep. He, standing in the squat rack that has view of the mirror decides to once again scream \"Don't fucking look at me\". I just kind of shrug this off and think hey, he's kinda mad I talked to the admin about him. This will probably be a one time thing. After it occurs around 5 more times I go and see the administrator about after he did it when my grill was with me. Same procedure goes by as last time. There was one minor difference. The admin told me not to look at him, or in mirrors that he can also be seen in. This kinda irritates me but whatever. Time passes. Sometimes he is kinda in my view, or I'm walking from place to place in the gym and in such instances it is hard not to look in his general direction. He uses these opportunities to shout his remarks once again, \"Don't fucking look at me\", throwing in the occasional motherfucker on the end. Being a rather passive person I let this occur a number of times but one day, after having a rather shitty day, he did it. So I told the administrator again. I am met with the same response as last time. Everything should be good, just don't look at him. Well Saturday I am at the gym. I am talking to a friend who I haven't seen in a while who was recently hospitalized and was just in town for the weekend seeing family. Anyway, previously that week I had attempted to PR on Bench. I got 240 for a single and had failed in my attempt at 250. So I was talking about it. Anyway the gentleman previously mentioned, you know the one who had repeated been an ass at the gym, over hears me and decides to begin shit talking me to a group of five or so people, rather loudly. My response as it has been a countless numbers of time was to ignore the problem and go about my day. Anyway as history seems to repeat it self today, I was at the gym, I had finished my workout and had decided instead of doing cardio on a bike for 10-20 minutes, since I had some free time and had friends playing, I may as well play basketball for an hour or so. The nature of the gym is that the weight area is visible from the basketball course and vice versa. After playing for about and hour I feel as if somebody is looking at me and I glance up. He and about four people are looking in my direction and then he proceeds to point. I think lets just shrug it off. This is followed by somebody coming downstairs to inform me that for roughly thirty minutes he has been talking shit on me. Once again shrug it off. An hour passes, I'm still playing basketball. Because to be honest I'm having fun and don't worry I had 25g of protein immediately after lifting and then ate two peanut butter sandwiches after a game of basketball. I felt like I was being looked at again so I glance over again. This time its him a two other people. This has honestly pushed my to my limit. I live in a rather small town and my parental figures have been informed of all of this previously. When I got home though I went to my father and gave him my plan. It was to go to the administrator tomorrow and talk to him again. If any altercation occured I would let his superiors know. Well my father decides to inform me that after the last incident he told numerous board members about it. Well that was followed by him and I going to see multiple board members.\n\nHonestly this situation is rather stupid in my opinion. Everybody in the gym has a like purpose, to improve themselves in some nature. The environment should thus be positive and people should support one another. In this gym I have NEVER felt that. It is filled with negativity and hatefulness. People frequently put down others. The small things are easy to overlook because in the big scheme of things they don't matter. This gentleman's repetitive nature of consistently negatively impacting others seems different to me though.\n\nAll in all I really want to know if I took the right steps? Am I The Asshole of the situation by telling the administrator? What could I have done differently, I want to learn in case of future conflict? What should I do now if no action is taken and altercations continue to ensue?",

I have been going to therapy for many years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.  My predicament is, I have a very good relationship with my dad which is suffering from my avoiding my mother.  My mother is very resentful of my independence and resents it when me and my dad spend time together.  My dad doesn't understand why I can't have a relationship with my mother and often tells me he wishes I could be around her to make her happier.  I don't want to lose my relationship with my dad but I just don't feel like I can confront my mother at this point in my life.

    "selftext": "Right, first off (and I completely understand if this isn't kosher with the mods) this isn't recent. If anything it happened several years back but it's tearing my family apart, my sister holds a grudge over it still and it's been stopping me from repairing relationships damaged over the incident. \n\nOkay, so brief bit of backstory. My mum died when I was 10, so a year later my dad took my brother and I to a support group for families affected by lost loved ones. We met my dad's new wife to be and her daughter, who was the same age as me. Over time they became close, and my brother and I bonded with our soon-to-be step-sister to the point of sleeping on her floor after nightly Star Wars Battlefront sessions. \n\nAbout a year later, my dad remarried and they moved in with us. My best friend took a liking to my step-sister, and she was interested in him. Because they were both shy (first relationship and all), I helped them coordinate a relationship for a while. My step-sister and I became good friends to the point of me considering her just a plain sister, even though I didn't (and I guess still don't) see my step-mother as a real mother to me. My friend and my sister broke up over something stupid, and she harboured some resentment towards me for a couple weeks as I tried to say he wasn't a complete asshole, but she eventually forgave me. \n\nFast forward another year, and we're in secondary school (uhhh middle school for you guys state-side? 12/13yr old anyway). My friend group and her friend group are pretty tight at this point, albeit with some awkwardness between my sister and I sharing friends (and her dislike for my BFF/her ex). We still spend most of our breaks (recess) playing football (soccer) on the field, whilst she and her friends reside in the lunch room gossiping and joking. Occasionally my BFFs (the ex and another guy) would leave our group to go chat up girls from her group (the ex would chat up one of my sister's friends, and the other BFF would try to flirt with my sister with some success). \n\nOne day as my group was walking across the playground to grab something from the lunchroom, my two friends came storming over. They had just been with my sister's group as usual, and looked livid. Apparently my sister had been extremely aggressive and rude to the pair of them without any provocation (later corroborated by *her* friends). They asked \"Why is she being such a massive bitch? Is she just like that?\". I kind of panicked, wondering what I should say, but overall I didn't want people to think my sister was a bad person. Somewhat selfishly I also had been hoping my other BFF and my sister would get together at some point (due to similar interests and affection shared between the two), so that also factored in to me not wanting my sister to be known as an \"explosive bitch\". \n\nI suggested that it was \"probably (my sister)'s time of the month, like hormones or something. She's not a bad person\". The group calmed down and talked amongst themselves, as some began whispering and giggling about the idea of my sister having a period (immature kids starting puberty and all). I told them to shut up and we went on with our day. Now, bear in mind that I was a 12 year old kid who had barely begun to learn about puberty and female hormonal changes, so it was the first thing that came to mind as to why she was acting odd. I also thought it was okay, as it was part of a normal bodily process that all women go through. \n\nGot home, and my dad had a go at me for making my sister upset. Apparently I had been spreading rumors about her, which embarrassed her. I apologised and explained the situation which he accepted but said I should tell *her* that. She refused to talk to me, and instead ignored me for the next 5 years (literally, she would only talk to me on rare Christmases when she *had* to). \n\nThe \"rumor\" was only between my group and hers, and literally disappeared within a week (my friends were like goldfish, forgot about it once they heard the new canteen burgers had mayo as standard). If anything it improved my friends views towards her, and my other BFF even suggested they should go out some time. \n\nSide note, that didn't work out because while she was considering it, she told me to go away and pushed me backwards down the stairs (I still believe as an accident) and said I'd never achieve anything. My friend heard about this, and stormed up to her criticising her actions before calling her a cunt, and storming off (the moment she swore a lifelong grudge against my BFFs). \n\nPoint is, she still refuses to talk to me, even attempted to convince her fiance (fiancee? I dunno) that I'm bad, even though he and I get on alright. I can sort of understand her hatred for my friends (one broke up with her over Runescape and later flirted with her friends, the other won her heart before defending me and called her a cunt). But I don't get why she still bears a grudge against me. I've been trying to make amends. I always talk to her politely if I have to talk to her, I say nothing but good things about her (even defending her actions when talking to my friends), and *always* buy her birthday and christmas presents that I put a ton of thought into. \n\nShe hasn't invited me to her wedding, a lot of my old friends that also were friends with her refuse to talk to me (those that do are rude and dismissive), and at this point it just hurts me tremendously. So I guess, is she justified? Am I the Asshole?",

I was always just generally someone who didn't stand out, I guess. I had 2/4 high school birthdays where my classmates forgot my birthday and nothing happened aside from last minute throwing something together like \"oops we forgot sorry\". Plus I was vocal about the approaching date, just no one cared. What am i going to decorate my own locker? Lol\n\nSo here I am, 25 years old, thinking those days are behind me.\n\nI work at a bank where it's 90% women in my department. As much as I hate the stereotype that women are \"cliquey\" that's exactly the atmosphere here. There's currently a 20 year age gap between me and the rest of my department. All the older women operate like the high school girls I hated and I'm never included in anything unless it's the entire department being invited. I've never really cared much until recently.\n\nMy office started doing balloons for people's birthdays. I knew the minute this began, I wasn't getting one. So what did I do? A few days before my birthday I made my work instant message status something like \"birthday in 5 days\" so people would know. I get to work the day after my birthday (birthday was Sunday) luckily, expecting nothing and I got nothing. It was fine, or so I thought.\n\nNow my bosses birthday just past and my other coworkers birthday is today and they both got balloons PLUS they want me to come out to dinner for my bosses birthday. (Let me just mention that a total of three people said happy birthday to me on the Monday after my birthday, only one was in my department). Also last year I was at a different location for my birthday, got no birthday wishes but was asked to attend dinner for my bosses birthday.\n\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole here because I feel like an asshole. I just feel so stupid for caring about something so incredibly stupid!! I think it's just walking past their desks having to stare at this crap that bugs me. It's like high school me is coming back because it reminds me of walking past all the decorated lockers when mine was bare. \n\nSo everyone, how pathetic am I?",

    "selftext": "This has been bothering me a bit since it happened last night.\n\nMy wife and I are fairly close with a childhood friend of mine and his wife. The 4 of us get along fairly well and are fairly similar in living situations: similar incomes (they're about 10% higher than us), living in the city, and both dual-income households. The key differences being we have no children (our friends have one), and we live in an apartment whereas they live in a condo (unknown whether they rent or purchased).\n\nMy wife was going through Facebook yesterday and commented that our friends got a new vehicle. I was initially happy for them, since one of their vehicles had been giving them problems (they have 2 - a 2005 model wagon and a 2012 model sedan). Shortly thereafter I came across the same posts in my FB feed. Turns out they traded in the 2012 model for a **new** (as in, 0 miles on odometer) 2016 model SUV. The 2005 model is still in their possession.\n\nPretty much by reflex I blurted out, \"well that was stupid. Hope they enjoy their depreciation\", in reference to the fact that [new vehicles lose on average 20% of their value as soon as they're driven off the lot](http://www.carfax.com/guides/buying-used/what-to-consider/car-depreciation). It is because of this that my wife and I have always bought used vehicles, and paid for them with cash.\n\nMy wife's reaction was just a statement about how saying stuff like that will guarantee a loss of already dwindling friends (oh the joys of being in your 30s). In my defense, what triggered **my** statement wasn't so much the fact that they financed a vehicle (we personally refrain from financing anything if we're able to), but rather that they did such on a **new** one when they already had one that was still low mileage and working just fine. I've been reflecting on my reaction ever since my wife responded to it.\n\nI mean they seem really happy and excited about it, but I don't think they realize how much of it's value they're going to lose over the next few years. Regardless, *neither of us have said anything at all to them about it (the situation/statement)*.\n\n**TL;DR: AITA for saying my friend's (who's in a similar life situation as we are - financially, etc) move to trade in their \"good\" car, finance a brand new car, and keep their shitty car is a dumb one?**",

I told him I have no problem paying a third of the TV/Internet bill though. I pulled my weight though, I always took out the garbage, cleaned the house, shoveled the snow. I wasn't freeloading, and I was paying rent elsewhere and I refused to officially move in, as there wasn't enough space and I wasn't going to pay for a storage unit for my things.\n\nAm I the asshole here for not splitting rent 3 ways?

Small one (and stupid one) , but I do not like the food.\n\n4. I have been put on a new instrument on the drumline and need to learn all of our cadences, and this trip will make me miss a whole month of practices, 6 hours a week. \n\n5.

Keep in mind, this doesn't mean I never want to go visit I just don't think this is the right time.\n\nEdit: This is also not a \"once in a life time chance\" because my father will be returning every year, as he has inherited property there from my deceased grandmother.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!  Thanks for your help.  I'll be happy to answer any further information questions.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I are coming up on our anniversary.  We always plan surprises for each other for these things.  He's planning something this year.  Tonight he was asking me how far he could drive my car for something anniversary related.  Here's some background on that.\n\nWe've been living together for two years.  Also in the past two years, people have hit my car four times.  One of these was sometime earlier today while it was parked.  Not serious damage, but I'm dreading dealing with it.  I'm assuming it's between 300-500 dollars in damage.  One of those hits resulted in my last car being totaled.  I'm a college student, so my single mother has had to absorb the costs of those issues.  It's been pretty stressful for us.\n\nAnyway, he wants to drive my car for the surprise.  I told him he can't drive my car for longer than 30 minutes, especially since my mom is going to be pretty upset about this latest incident.  He doesn't have a car since we live in a city.  \n\nHe was vague about how far it was, giving me estimates for as short as an hour to as long as fifteen hours.  He was being cutesy about it, so he wasn't being a jerk or intentionally misleading, just trying to keep it vague for the surprise.  After this latest issue, I just don't feel comfortable with taking any risks.  I wasn't sure how my insurance would treat an accident if someone else was driving my vehicle.  Partway through the conversation, I told him I'd have to check my insurance policy on it.  \n\nHe was very pushy about driving my car to do this.  I felt it was pretty reasonable for me to be uncomfortable with all things considered.  I just wish he would have considered my feelings and anxieties on the matter, an issue we've talked about at length before, also somewhat recently, but I didn't bring up this time.\n\nAm I being unreasonable?  He was saying I'm being paranoid.  I just don't feel my family can deal with any more stressors, and he's not an insured motorist because he doesn't have a car.  Is that fair, or is it paranoid?  Am I being an asshole for being touchy about this?\n\nThis is a pretty typical issue between us.  Me being \"paranoid,\" him being \"rational.\"  \n\nI got pretty pissed at one point and brought that up, so he got upset and stopped wanting to talk to me.  I told him essentially that he uses \"rational\" as a front to get what he wants.  I said he puts down other people's views as irrational and says his are more rational, but they're not, it's just a tool.  I mean, I'd have to write a book about us to communicate our sides on that.  Anyway, that's what I said.  Maybe it's a pretty asshole thing to say.\n\nAlso, for a point of reference, all of the reasons I gave in here he heard as well.\n\nI feel bad because he was excited about this and certainly wanted it to be a positive thing, but I felt he went through with it thoughtlessly and without considering a ton of things he should be completely aware of.  So when I started to reject his ideas, things got messy, he started stone-walling me.  But maybe I am just being paranoid and shitty about it.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.  Thanks again for your input.",

    "selftext": "Sorry if this a little long, but I just need to get these thoughts somewhere out of just my own head.\n\nSo ,LDR of  about 2 months at the time(started in December), everything's fine. She visits me at school every other weekend, we text/call all the time, love hanging out with her etc. \n\nThe ~second time she's visiting someone's blowing up her phone like all weekend, a text or a call every 5-10 minutes most of which she isn't even responding to. Naturally curious I ask who it is and she tells me it's her ex...who's also her manager at work(important to note). \n\nThey had been long time friends through family, were together for maybe a year or two, and had broken it off roughly a year before we'd gotten together. Let's call him Craig. Her Craig started working at the same place at the same time, both had a chance at management but she declined because made more off tips than what management would've payed or something like that. We had talked about him before that day because she wanted to know if how I felt that they were still cool, to which I said sure; she likes me plenty so I didn't feel insecure about it , and if they were friends before it seemed like they should friends after being together unless it was a bad break up or something. whatevs.\n\nSo I see some of the text Craig's sending while me and her are just chilling. It started off with him being salty about her switching shifts or something to come see me and had devolved into  salty rambling about her coming to see me, how she's so ungrateful, etc. super jealous stuff about us being together. Shit goes on literally all day, we woke up to her phone going off every minute or so and only slept after she finally put her phone on silent and stopped replying all together. She hardly pays it any mind and neither do I. Most of his ramblings go unread by the both of us.\n\nA couple of conversations with her about her ex's in general (why they broke up, etc.) and we get to Craig. Come to find out, from what she tells me, dude's a fucking mess. Alcoholic, not in school, gets in fights all the time,  **abusive**, etc. Makes me even less worried than I ever was that she might be interested in him, but abusive sticks out. She tells me a story about how he choked her out once and she thought she was going to die...so of course I'm thinking \"why are you even civil with this dude anymore?\" but I just leave it at half jokingly telling her I better not ever met him and I drop it.\n\nA month  goes by and then there's a sudden, uncharacteristic silence from her. No phone calls from her, barely answering texts and taking way longer than usual to do so, doesn't want to visit, nothing for like 3 weeks. I ask what's wrong, all I get is that she's going through some stuff and doesn't feel like talking but won't give any more detail than that, ok. Can't really do anything other keep trying to talk to her and try to make her feel better or see if there's anything I can do to help, so that's all I do.\n\nShe slowly gets back to normal communicating, visits etc. but I'm still bothered by this (almost) month of silence on top of several other things stressing me out that could fill another AITA post this long. Super long story short, after having a small mental breakdown she tells me she was raped by an ex, doesn't say who and I don't even think to ask in the moment. I'm caught off guard trying to think of what to say or do or how to feel etc. She tells me she only told me because I was so worried about her and not knowing what happened and that if it wasn't for that she wasn't planning to tell anybody. The whole thing raised a bunch of emotions and questions that I knew I either couldn't have or that she really didn't want to answer about it, I kinda just sat mostly in silence for a while before going back to talking about what else was bothering me.\n\n\nFast Forward some weeks, I still have no more details about it other than it happened with ...some ex and that she doesn't want to talk about it. I only make it effort to bring it up once in a relevant argument about something else, but other just give her space to talk about it if and when she feels like it. \n\nBut then we're hanging out one day with her family, I'm dicking around on her phone on IG or something when she get's a text from a number with no name that says \"how's your day going?\". I ask who's the number, she says it's Craig... idk why it all clicked in that moment but it did so I ask her later what ex she was referring to about the rape thing. Of fucking course it was Craig. So not only does she have to see and put with him at work and has been doing so since it happened 2-3 months ago, but he's still blowing up her phone talking telling her she wanted it etc. and she still just doesn't want to talk about it. I tell her I wish she'd call the cops , tell hr, at least block the niggas number...anything? and she's still just saying she doesn't want to talk about it, \"you don't just tell people you got raped\" , telling me I should just forget about it and move on etc. . And I get that but am I crazy for wanting literally anything to be done right now other than her suggestion of just pretending it didn't happen? I could understand if it was it was some random unknown person you'd never see again in some alley etc. but I don't understand how she's ever going actually to get over this with him constantly being a  reminder of the incident and I really (hopefully understandably) don't feel comfortable with her being forced to being around and in contact with him all the time and I don't see how she could feel any different.  \n\n\n**TL;DR : Girlfriend was raped by an ex with a history abusive behavior, who's still harassing her and who she has to see at work on a regular basis. Am I crazy that I want something done about this? That I'm not ok just pretending that nothing happened like she seems to want to do? Am I pressing her about this too much? Is this not shit I should be this concerned about?** ",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR:** 2 parking permits for 5 people, one person wants one of the permits next year but the current holder who had it all this year refuses to give it up. AITA for supporting the one who wants it?\n\n**Background:** I (Dan) share a house with 4 other university students (Oscar, Derek, Jeff, and Brian.) In our living situation we have 2 street parking permits to divide amongst the 5 of us. There are no likely ways to obtain a third permit. Currently, Oscar and Jeff hold the permits. Also, it must be noted that despite none of us really knowing each other at the start of the year, Dan (me), Derek, Jeff, and Brian have grown to be much better friends with each other than we are with Oscar.\n\n**The Conflict:** Next year, Derek wants to have one of the parking permits so he can bring his car from home, meaning that if he gets his way either Oscar or Jeff will have to give up their permit. Since Jeff uses his car mostly to commute to a job he needs to support himself but Oscar uses his mostly for pleasure (trips to the beach, etc.) Derek thought that the \"right thing\" would be for Oscar to give up his permit. There was a large argument about it. Derek argues that since the permits belong to the house as a whole, the fair thing is for one of the current permit holders to give up their permit to him (letting him have a \"turn\" to bring his car up) and further argues that the \"right\" thing to do is for Oscar to give up his permit so Jeff can still easily commute to his job. Oscar argues that it is not his responsibility that Jeff will not be able to go to work and further that he should be allowed to keep the permit as he expressed interest in it first (by claiming it this year.) Moreover, Oscar believes that Derek's closer friendship with the rest of the house turned popular opinion against him and the house is \"ganging up on him.\"\n\n**The Current Situation:** After the argument, Oscar (unbeknownst to the rest of the house) called the city and secured one of the permits in his name next year. Needless to say, Derek and Jeff and to a lesser extent myself are furious at Oscar for his unilateral decision, Derek more so because he now cannot gain a permit without severely inconveniencing his friend, which he will not do, meaning Oscar's actions have barred him from bringing his car up. Brian, to his credit, is trying to remain neutral, though his position is more for the sake of household cohesion than out of support for Oscar.\n\n**My Position:** I agree with Derek. I believe that it is only fair that Derek should be allowed to use the common house resource as much as Oscar does in a fair way (Oscar this year, Derek next year,) and that Derek is doing the right thing in letting Jeff keep his permit. I further consider Oscar's actions in going behind the backs of the house to get the permit selfish and disrespectful to the rest of us. AITA in thinking this way? Is Derek in the right? \n\nEdit 1: I would like to clarify that the argument was between Derek, Oscar, and Jeff. Brian and myself were not directly involved, and I personally only expressed my opinion when asked.\n\nEdit 2: I would also like to clarify that the parking permits expire yearly. Also, slight formatting changes.\n\nEdit 3: I apologize for the long comment chains below. I'm kind of using this thread as a way to get all my thoughts out on paper. Thanks all for participating!\n\n**Edit 4:** First of all, thank you all for commenting. You've helped me see the other side of the story that Oscar did not make clear to me himself. I still think he is wrong to believe the permit automatically defaults to him, and that the right thing for Oscar to do is to give Derek the permit, but as far as I'm concerned now Derek is on his own to convince Oscar of that. I cannot require Oscar, or anyone, to live by my own moral standards. I think I will withdraw from the fight and seek neutral ground with respect to the core issue with Brian. I guess I might have been if not the asshole at least the taint in this situation haha, and I'd like to remedy that if I can. I may also try and suggest names out of a hat or perhaps an auction for the spaces, but I think that unfortunately Oscar's actions with the city have made compromise in those ways impossible.",

We started with 8 people, this year there are 30+ people expected to come.\n\nWe personally invited them a couple months ago and watched them both input it excitedly in their calendars, we\u2019ve talked about the upcoming trip a few times since then, they both requested off work. Everything is a go, they said they were going and everyone is excited as this is the first year they\u2019re able to come with us and everyone else who is attending loves hanging out with them as well.\n\nFor the last 3 weeks they\u2019ve not returned calls or texts, which isn\u2019t necessarily unusual, but is irritating.\n\nSo scrolling through social media I find out from a week old post that they are taking a 9 day trip ending the day AFTER our outing is supposed to happen. This is the first I\u2019ve heard they were not coming on our trip. Which is now only 25 days away. I tried to bring it up without sounding like an asshole, I commented on the post with \u201cSoooo you guys aren\u2019t coming on the trip? :(\u201d and she replied with \u201cI don\u2019t think so sorry :(\u201d with not another word about it.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset about this?\n\n\nTLDR: friend didn\u2019t cancel long standing plans with us before deciding on another trip. I found out through other means.\n\nETA: My boyfriend thinks that I'm overreacting by being so upset, but this isn't the first time she/they have been inconsiderate.",

    "selftext": "My sister is 23, I am 18. I have a car, she hasn't had a car in probably 2 years. I always drive her to the gym, or a friend's house, or whatever to the point that I have to fill up on gas once a week at least, and she doesn't pay for anything. Now that I am out of college for the summer, she's asking me more often to take her places. AITA for not wanting to? I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\n\nEDIT:\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \n\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it. So there's that, in case ya'll were wondering about the condition of the car.",

I rolled/purchased smokes for my dad too, but I also drove around in his truck at age 5 sitting on a milk crate with no car seat or seatbelts.  *Different. Times*. We argued for quite awhile about it.\n\nI really try not to judge parents on their actions, because I believe kids are resilient and we generally over-parent these days, but this event really fired me up.

    "selftext": "This past year I moved to a new city and had to find some random people to be my roommates. I found these two girls online, and they seemed pretty normal, we had mutual friends, etc. etc. One of them is really friendly, but the other I've been having really strange, passive aggressive conflicts with. The first time I met her she was too drunk to form words, and I've never been able to really have a conversation with her for the whole six months I've been living here. When I attempt to say anything to her, she will either completely ignore me or give me very curt answers. Sometimes she locks herself out and texts me, but besides that she will always rudely avoid me. I'm not really sure what her deal is about me, I have stayed out of her way pretty much the whole year. Buut, last night she texted me the longest, most dramatic text about something really insignificant that happened earlier that day. Obviously some rage or tension has been building up and she chose a really dumb situation to pour it all out. The next day I tried calling her to see if she was okay and have a conversation about the tension, but she denied the call. I then texted her and tried express how I was feeling, and that I was concerned about all the rage coming out at once. Unfortunately, though, instead of having a real human conversation, she just answered in very short texts like \"Got it\" or \"Yep, I agree.\" I was really frustrated about this, especially since getting those long explosive texts gives me really intense anxiety. I feel like I'm getting a heart attack every time someone texts me something dramatic. So, in an effort to maybe have a real conversation, I decided to block her number. If she asks, I'll explain why I did it. Its rude of me to block the number, but its also rude to completely ignore my existence. The thing is, I'm not sure if this is furthering the hole of passive agressiveness. What if she gets locked out, or if there's an emergency? I honestly wish cellphones didn't exist so I didn't have to have these super dramatic text conversations that really just mean nothing. I also want to stop getting high anxiety when I'm at work or with friends. Any thoughts? ",

    "selftext": "Background: I've known my best friend for 3 years, she and her boyfriend have been dating for under 2 years. I used to consider him a friend, too. But as soon as he moved in with her, he became allot more \"critical\" of her friends. I went from always hanging out with BestFriend to maybe seeing them once a week.\n\nOnce, my best friend mentioned her brothers kid, who has my first name. He *flipped out*, he yelled and threw a tantrum because he heard my name, and now she can't mention the kid anymore.\n\nI was upset I couldn't hang out at my friends house on weekends anymore, but she at least assured me the meetup group would stay \"mine\", because I was her first member.\n\nShe brought him a few weeks ago (and, therefore, left me at home) and she said in her defence we had hung out all week. But a few days ago, she brought him *and* me, even though I hadn't seen her in two weeks.\n\nIn my defence, I was really stressed about finals, and I wanted to talk to her. But I can't talk with him in the car, because he talks to her instead and I can't get a word in. He can talk with her 24/7, I haven't seen her in two weeks, and I can't talk to her. I ended up doing poorly on my finals the next day, I was really stressed.\n\nI don't even feel comfortable talking around him, no one does. He alienates all her friends. Me and BestFriend have another, mutual friend. She is the sweetest girl you will ever meet, she can't walk into a room without making 5 new friends. But he has expressed dislike for her, because she makes BestFriend laugh too much. The last time she was at BestFriends house, he made her feel so unwelcome, she didn't talk to BestFriend for several weeks.\n\nMy best friend has another friend, let's call her AlcoholicAss. I never had a problem with AlcoholicAss. I've been around her a few times, we really don't have anything in common, but we always got along. Then, over a year ago, my best friend and I went to a botanical garden, and I put the pictures on Facebook.\n\nI guess AlcoholicAss was jealous my best friend went somewhere cool without her, because she saw the pictures, and then said some pretty *nasty* things about me *on my own Facebook wall*, and proceeded to trash talk me (and her boyfriend, too) for weeks afterward. BestFriend have kept us apart ever since.\n\nNow, my friend does a weekly hike I used to go on, and I wanted to go again. She said sure, but changed her mind because AlcoholicAsshole wanted to go, and then the next few times because she *might* go. (But when her plans changed, and she instead needed someone to babysit her dog for 12 hours without pay or food, guess who she woke up early Sunday morning?)\n\nI said that wasn't fair, that she knows I wouldn't say anything rude to AlcoholicAss, but she said that she promised her they'd hang out there, and that she hadn't seen her in a while. When I tried to point out then it wasn't fair for her to bring her boyfriend to the meetup group, when I haven't gotten to see her, when I needed some time to hang out with my friend, when she promised me that that place was my territory, it was safe and he wouldn't encroach on it.\n\nI never got to finish that discussion, she flipped out and started yelling at me.\n\n So when she brought him to group again this week, I told her \"Good, then I'm going on the hike.\" She said \"Ok\", though later admitted that *\"We'll see*\". I tried to point out that if he was at group, after I hadn't seen her in weeks, then she had no right to say I couldn't come to the hike. Instead, she shot me a really angry look, and I dropped it, in case she decided not to give me a ride home.",

    "selftext": "For my 21st birthday my boyfriend and I are going to Universal Studios Harry Potter World. This book was a huge part of my childhood, it's impacted my life immensely and I've been looking forward to going to Harry Potter world literally for possibly 10 years since the one in Orlando opened (I'm going to the new one in Hollywood)\n\nMy boyfriend has never read the books OR seen the movies, so I wanted him to read them because I love them. I got him hard copies of the first two books and logged him into my audible account so he could listen or read. He loved the first book and wanted to read them all. At some point a few months ago, he promised he'd finish the series by my birthday so when we went to Harry Potter world we could kind of immerse together and not worry about spoilers or anything. \n\nMy birthday is in a few days and he's just finishing the first book. Last night I checked the lengths of the audiobooks and found he'd have to read 16 hours a day to finish them in time. I was honestly surprised at how disappointed I was. I pouted for a little without telling him why, I admit that. Then I told him I was disappointed but felt the reason was stupid, and then I finally told him why. Yes, I was somewhat difficult about it, I know it's uncool to be all evasive like that. I was just embarrassed. \n\nSo after I told him he tried to figure out how to read them in time by listening at 2x speed but I knew it wasn't gonna work and I'd rather him read and absorb the books than power through them to meet some arbitrary deadline. At this point I started crying, and even considered postponing the trip until he finished but I'd have to miss work, which I can't really do. \n\nHe feels terrible and told me so. I didn't say I was mad, and I was a little but mostly I'm just disappointed. I told him I forgive him but that I'm still bummed about it, and I know he feels terrible but I'm still upset. I feel so stupid but like, of all the things I want for my birthday, this is the only one I can't get myself if I wanted. I even told him when he asked what I wanted for my birthday that it was for him to finish the books. \n\nI feel like shit because he's incredibly sweet, he already paid the adoption fee for a cat as an early gift, I know he's gonna pamper me and everything but I'm still disappointed. He said he failed me and ruined my birthday. I told him he didn't, that it's a small thing and we'll still have fun, but honestly I am still disappointed. But I feel like I shouldn't have even brought it up objectively I know it's not a huge thing and it would only make him feel bad. So am I the asshole for bringing it up knowing it's too late for him to do anything?",

However, my friend managed to take too long to get the ID for the plane ticket since my dad was paying, since he had no money. Anyways, tickets went way up so it was a no. My friend in SF asked why he lagged and if he stays where we're at, San Diego, then he can get a job and asked if he's still in school. I said he's doing neither and he asked why, I told him he's fucking up. The reason my SF friend asked this is because his mom would've let my other friend live in SF as a way to get away from everything as long as he continued the right path. So, yeah I told him, I also told this other friend who knows him and told him how he let a DIFFERENT guy, whose already super dumb \"try\" heroin because he'd be able to \"handle\" the high since he's done oxycotin and we we're like \"damn that's a dumb decision\".\nBasically, he's super mad at me and saying I should mind my own business and that it's not something you should tell people because the stigma of it is bad and people look down on that.

The incident in question happened a few months ago but it has been bugging me ever since so I thought I would submit it for your guys' judgment. \n\nI was boarding a very full plane and had an aisle seat. When I was almost to my row, I noticed a woman telling a man in my row that he was in her seat (window seat). He moved without a fuss, but proceeded to sit in my aisle seat. Once I reached the row, I tried to lte him know that I thought he was in the wrong seat. He got a bit upset and claimed that he had the aisle seat. Now at this point, I am getting a bit flustered as well because I really struggle in social situations and there are people waiting behind me to get to their seats in the back of the plane. To try and prove to him that he is in my seat and resolve the problem ASAP, I show him my boarding pass which clearly says 19C (aisle seat). However, he then continued to insist that the aisle seat is his. Eventually, a flight attendant comes over and I show her my ticket and she asks the man to move over a seat, which he does (albeit unhappily). I get and few glares from the people who had to wait behind me while he wouldn't let me in my seat, but at that time I felt that I was in the right. However, after we had both sat down I realized that because he was a rather large man, he might have wanted the window or aisle seat in order to not intrude on the personal space of the passengers on both sides of him.

My mother has complained for the last two years that my brother has never done any work, but I haven't had a first-hand account of this due to me being away at college. (I gave him the benefit of the doubt because my mom is mentally unstable and for other reasons that aren't necessary to disclose.)\n\nHowever, now that I'm home, all I see him do is play video games for hours on end-literally from the moment he gets up to the moment my mother comes home from work (a good 8-9 hours a day). He scrambles to finish 2-3 assignments per day to make it seem like he's working (in reality, this is a terrible strategy since he has 8 classes). He gets into these terrible anger fits when he can't play so nobody ever has stopped him until I came home. It doesn't help that I am (not can be, but am) a bossy cunt-I get pissed that he doesn't do his work and start ordering him around (totally my fault for losing my temper, I know).\n\nNow, fast forward to the past week or so-my brother needs to finish his work in the next two weeks or else he has to postpone something super important that has been planned since birth (almost out of the question to postpone). So my mom has started asking me to 'check' my brother's work-apparently I didn't catch the memo that this meant 'do' his work, and when I didn't comply (because that is cheating) she said (and I quote): \n\n\"You know what's cheating? Us giving you the money to take your GREs. Other kids out there have to work for that test and you just stole the money from us. You had an unfair advantage over those other kids. Now THAT'S real cheating.\"\n\nNaturally, I pulled a major bitch fit and spent five minutes almost yelling at her for various reasons, and stormed off. I guess she became apologetic because she tried to talk to me but I didn't respond (because no), and now she's pissed (my mother is currently at an atomic bomb level pissed). My brother is also mad at me because he thinks that diploma equals 'advanced tutoring'. I understand my reaction was over the top-I'm not good at developing arguments when I'm angry so I know it didn't turn out well. However, I don't like feeling used and the concept of cheating isn't something I want to instill in my brother.\n\nTL;DR: mom and bro wanted me to cheat, got pissed &amp; said no, WW3 at house.",

Definitely a dog person and this has been true forever.\n\nMy girlfriend (21) is about to move into an apartment with a friend. This friend owns a cat and it lives at the apartment. She's moving from her parents home where she currently has a cat and dog. Part of her decision to move was to be about fifteen minutes closer to school and to live with her friend, knowing this would mean seeing less of her pets and losing some space. She claims she has wanted this cat for a while but I haven't heard a word about it and I'm convinced that the new friend has sort of convinced her to get this new cat.\n\nWe talked (maybe even argued) about this on and off for almost 7 hours today while I was at work and now she's just worked up and upset that I'm not validating her feelings or understanding her point of view. So here I am trying to understand. We've been dating for a long time, she knows I'm not a cat person, we have some loose plans to move in together next fall, so any decision made now has to sort of consider that.  \n\nAs far as actual reasoning goes, this is what she has shared with me; she's worried if she doesnt get a cat now, she won't have the chance to later. She wants the other girls cat to have a friend. And that's it. Nothing about wanting something to take care of, come home to, or anything actually emotional or meaningful in my opinion. I don't see why she cant just enjoy having the extra time with her friend and the other cat and even see her own pets on weekends or whenever she wants to drive home. On top of that she's starting a new job and still has a year left of school so she has plenty to keep her occupied without having to take care of an animal. \n\nFeel free to ask questions but I'm working on getting to sleep soon so I may not answer until morning. Hopefully someone can provide some sort of insight because the whole situation feels like a really juvenile and pointless arguement.\n\nEdit: thanks for the replies everyone. We took some time to think and found the deeper issue behind this cat fiasco and we were able to take steps towards solving it. These different perspectives helped me out a lot.",

So basically music, video games, electronics, or anything I have fun with I will only spend maybe $150 a month on. Because of this I have accrued a decent size savings account which is what I use for surprise appointments for myself or my car.

I told him to back up after bumping against him a couple times. I'm sure I sounded annoyed.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "So let me preface this with a couple of things. \n\nFirst, I am a known headphone guy. I love headphones and audio in general, but I am very picky. Everyone in my family knows I am a headphone guy as well.\n\nSecond, I'm not trying to play victim. The other party is by no means in the wrong, but I may or may not be.\n\nJust wanted to get it across before I begin. \n\nSo it's November an my Uncle, who I have been living with for the past 4 to 5 years, asks me what I want for Christmas. I ended up having to decide between a new motherboard and a new pair of headphones. I finally settled on a new pair of Audio Technica ATH-AD900X's. They are well known to be a very open, very neutral set of headphones that I had my eye on for a while. I tell my uncle this and make sure to tell him that they are not available in most retail stores and if he is unable to get them to buy the motherboard instead.\n\nChristmas roles around and he goes to Best Buy in search of the headphones. He is in his 50's and is very oldschool, so he doesn't know the first thing about technology. He barely knows what to look for. He ends up unable to find them, so he asks an employee about headphones. The employee, who is also not knowledgeable when it comes to audio, sells him a pair of Turtle Beach's for well over the price of the intended cans. For those of you who don't know, gaming headsets have really terrible audio quality with the exception of one or two, which aren't even spectacular. Turtle Beach is especially bad. So Christmas roles up and I open the package to find exactly what I was fearful of. I put on a face because I'm not going to act like a 12 year old because I didn't get what I wanted. He included the receipt in the wrapping because he knew I was very specific in what I asked for.\n\nI take that as permission to return them with no hard feelings. A few days later I return from a local shop with the headphones I wanted. Immediately upon walking through the door he looks disappointed. It's pretty clear I made him feel bad, and I feel like a complete asshole. We have an awkward conversation about it and I go to run the headphones through my standard testing playlist.\n\nSo, it goes without saying that I'm either the asshole or there is no asshole. I still don't really know how I feel about it. I tried to give as much detail about it as possible.",

They are all going because they already purchased tickets to go to a concert within the amusement park. I, on the other hand, had no access to this concert. They told me I could just go on rides while they were at the concert... I don't have any money for a concert ticket because I spent my money on a season pass a few weeks prior to these plans.\n\n\n\nIn an iMessage group chat, the topic of how we were going to get there comes up. None of us can drive because we are all teenagers without licenses. We try our parents but none of them are willing to drive us there. An idea pops up in one of my friends head: Uber. Okay let's just use an Uber that could fit all six of us (expensive) to go to a place that is miles away from where we live (even more expensive.) Keep in mind this would be doubled because they were planning to take Uber to and from the amusement park. I ask them how they're going to pay for this Uber and whether there will be an Uber drive who will be willing to drive 6 kids to an amusement park for 2 hours. Especially when we leave it will be 10 pm at night. We needed a card for Uber anyway and everyone claimed they only carry cash. One girl, let's call her Dana, suggests that I pay for the Uber, using the fact that she remembers that I had one against me. I don't have much money in my debit card because what goes in there is basically allowance money and gift money. I tell her in private that I don't want to use my card. Dana replies with, \"Why Not?\" I told her if she had her own card she would understand. \n\n\nWell this private conversation with her gets screenshotted and sent to the group chat where we were making plans. So much for private messaging. Everyone is in the chat act offended and say \"exposed!!!!!!!\" They tell me that they're going to give me money so I can put it in my card before we go on the trip. But how are they so sure that what they will give me will cover their ride? And they aren't even considering the fact that it takes time out of my life to meet up with them, get the money, and deposit it in my bank. I tell them I don't want and they act upset. I know I'm the only one with a debit card but I just don't feel comfortable with using it for this. Sorry if this was confusing to read. Am I the asshole? \n\n\nTL;DR: Friends want me to use my card to pay for an expensive Uber ride that will carry 6 people and will be a 2 hour car ride. They reason that I'm the only one with a card in the group and that they're just going to pay me before hand so I can put it in the card before hand.",

    "selftext": "So I am a high schooler who drives a car that is a little too nice for me. I've been working since I was 11 and I put a lot of money into getting this car (Not all of it, but a significant amount). Included in this washing my car twice a week, and spending hours just caring for it. It's honestly one of the few things I care about, and when people mess with my car I don't take it lightly. \n\nSo the incident happened yesterday when one of my friends decided to do a slide across my hood. When he did this he put a pretty good sized dent in the hood. I was immediately pissed and he was also immediately apologetic. He said he would pay for the damage and I agreed. I think he was expecting around $60 to fix it, and I was too. I managed to fix it a little bit, but there is a very slightly noticeable crease in the hood that only I can notice, but it is there.  Today I was driving around and went to 5 different auto body repair shops, and all agreed I needed a respray, which would be around $400. I know his family can't come close to afford paying for it, but he damaged my car and I'm insisting that he still pays. It's such a bad place for me to be because I know that he can't afford to fix my car, but he should take responsibility for his actions. He's a good friend and I don't want to have to take it to a further step if he can't pay. I don't want to risk the friendship over a dent, but I don't want the dent in the one thing I care about. Am I the asshole for making him pay?",

I've been working hard this year in my apprenticeship and I feel like I deserve to buy this car, so I'm going to buy it, but she just doesn't understand why I want it because it's ugly and doesn't belive that it'll last a day before I get problems with it. I'm buying this car because I've worked hard and it is honestly one of my dream cars to own and I have an opportunity to buy it now so I'm taking that chance.

I had an old clarinet laying around and I thought \"hey, maybe he could use this to practice on.\" I let him take the clarinet with him so that he could use it as a practice instrument, something to mess up on or fix or whatever.\n\nHe kept the clarinet from September to May, his entire program, giving me updates here and there along the way. He would tell me this week they were doing pad work, that week they were working with whatever tools. One day he told me he needed to replace the pads and he could get them for a low amount, so I told him to get me an amount of what it would cost. He never got back to me.\n\nFlash forward to today, he texts me and says \"I have your clarinet, it will be $300 for the repairs.\" I kind of respond in jest, thinking he was messing around, to which responds he isn't kidding. His reasoning is that $300 was a third of what it would have cost had I brought it in to a shop.\n\nI'm between a rock and a hard place. Part of me thinks that, at the end of the day, I got a completely overhauled clarinet that is probably in pretty good shape. He performed a service on the instrument, and he should be compensated. Maybe I should have been more aggressive in knowing the price of everything. The other part thinks, he never quoted me any kind of number before doing the repairs. He just told me out of the blue what the cost is going to be. And, because he's a pretty good friend of mine, I feel obligated to pay. \n\nI agreed to pay $100 a month for the next three months. Today I asked him for a receipt, just so I could see exactly what he did that would constitute a $900 repair job. He replied saying we don't have to worry about a receipt because there are still some moldy pads that need to be replaced, but because he doesn't want to work on it anymore and I don't want him to work on it anymore, he would give the clarinet back to me with the repairs he's done free of charge.\n\nI had planned on getting some form of compensation for him.

    "selftext": "If you're interested, here's a [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4ppio6/my_26m_parents_60mf_want_to_see_my_current/) to a thread I did on this in /r/relationshipadvice. \n\nI am a 26 year old guy who is getting a second degree and living with his parents. I am also a complete shut in loser, and I literally have  no friends. \n\nAnyway, so my parents and my therapist are great people, but they did something that has hurt me to my core. My parents have been struggling in their marriage ever since I was a small child, and probably before that. I have begged them for years to seek marriage counseling. Unfortunately, they chose my therapist to go and see. \n\nThe reason they did this was complicated, however it ultimately boils down to my father having trust issues, and he has known my therapist for about forty years. They have a professional relationship, and that is ultimately why I was recommended to her by him. \n\nNow, my therapist and my parents are my only social contacts. I am far too shy to say anything to anyone at school. I have a roster of mental health diagnoses, but among them is a pretty nasty case of social anxiety. \n\nAnyway, I feel betrayed by my therapist for not only meeting my parents, but the entirety of my social circle behind my back. I am considering firing her, despite liking her a lot, because my trust in her is fundamentally shaken by this. My parents are begging me not to, citing that I have grown a lot since seeing her, and that it would be tragic if I did indeed leave after this mistake. My parents insist that no therapy took place in this situation, but instead, the therapist said that she would counsel them only if I allowed it. I am totally not okay with that, since I live with my parents, and my therapist would not be seeing me for me if she also got information about my life (at least indirectly) from my parents. I think that is fundamentally a terrible idea. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I the asshole for wanting to fire my therapist?\n\nTL;DR: My therapist did a consultation job for my parents. She said that she would only give them marriage counseling if I was cool with it. I'm not cool with it. These three people are the entirety of my social circle, and I feel betrayed by my therapist for seeing my family behind my back. Am I the asshole for wanting to fire my therapist?  \n\nEdit: Thank you for your sage input, everyone. ",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, so I know breakups typically go with walls of text, so I'll be as brief as possible\n\nWas with my girlfriend for a year and a half. I noticed she randomly started to never want to be intimate, always go out with her friends instead of spending any time with me, and just seem really uninterested and distant, which is super painful. She also started spending (a lot) more time than I was comfortable with with this other guy, sometimes just not coming home until the next day. I was pretty pissed.\n\nAnyway, her birthday rolls around and she has a party at our house. I fucking cannot stand her friends and I know this fucking guy is going to be there too. In the spirit of fairness in storytelling, she knows I hate them and always go out of my way to avoid spending time with them and will just ditch if they come around because fuck them.  They are all just such trash, I could go on. I begrudgingly take the night off to attend it, though I suck at hiding my emotions, so I'm fairly hostile to the guests. Not yelling or anything but a couple snarky comments and a very rude exit (I'm not going to pretend I handled it well).  I just go to bed early. \n\nI wake up and she's gone and won't respond to texts. Finally at 1pm she shows up in that guys car. We get in a big fight and go on a \"break\" for a week in which she basically refuses to talk to me , because apparently the silent treatment is a great way to resolve conflicts. Anyway, that ends and we have this brief, fucked up \"open relationship\". She's still never around ever. Everytime we talk she seems distant and we fight a lot, and she always brings up how I acted like an asshole to her friends at the party. She also tells me in some weird vague way she thinks I'm abusive and jealous and possessive (I would deny the first, but I'll admit readily to the latter 2).\n\nI eventually break up with her because I'm sick of being constantly ignored. We still live together and fight a lot. We have a big blowup about her relationship with that guy because she sleeps on his couch every night and she tells me he was the friend she leaned on because she realised our relationship wasn't working. She also basically told me she realised she wanted to break up a while ago but couldn't bring herself to do it because she knew I loved her so she just kinda started being away until I finally did.\n\nI am picking a lot of fights lately and frankly being a lot more abrasive than I need to in them because I'm so angry and bitter and hurt about how it all went and I'm wondering if I'm the abusive asshole she says I am. As a fun note, she claims that after the party she had random friends of friends telling her \"your boyfriend is shitty, you should leave him\" because people don't mind their own goddamned business anymore. \n\nAnyway. This has probably gone on long enough and you're probably bored. be honest, roast me should you care to, I just want to know.\n\nTL;DR - Relationship was fucked. Girlfriend started ignoring me for 2 months and sleeping over at a guys house all the time. I was an asshole to her friends at her birthday, we broke up later. I'm resentful and have a bone to pick so I'm picking lots of fights",

I was out of town for business so we decided to celebrate few days late and for her birthday present I took her to NYC for the weekend including 4 star hotel and a front row seat to Aladdin on Broadway, her favorite disney movie and a dinner at a 5 star restaurant and a beautiful pearl necklace to wear to it.  Originally she said we should just combine our two birthdays for the trip but I told her no cause I wanted my birthday to be about me and her birthday to be about her (plus I paid for the entire trip).  So it was just to celebrate her birthday.  We get back from NYC and its the day between getting back and in 2 days is my birthday.  Her roommate's father passes away.  She and her roommate is very close so she decides to accompany her the wake but promises to be back in time for my birthday.  Next day she calls me and says due to miscommunication that she's actually gonna be there another day and will miss my birthday.  I understood and I told her funeral beats birthday.  However I don't hear from her me entire birthday, she comes back next day in the afternoon and when I brought up making up for missing my birthday and doing some post-celebration she simply asked me \"didn't you celebrate with your friends and family already?\"\n\nTLDR+additional details\nSo i understood her missing my birthday for her roommate's father's funeral but got mad for several other reasons, primary center reason being she didn't seem to care about my birthday at all\n\nInstead of suggesting something something to do on my birthday or come up with a plan she just wanted to throw it into her celebration\n\nher-It makes sense, trip is right between our birthdays\nme-yeah but I am paying for the trip and want our respective birthdays to be about you and me separately\n\nDidn't hear from her at all on my birthday\n\nher-I was at a funeral with a broken phone\nme-funeral wasn't all day and you could have texted me with someone else's or gone on a computer and FBed me\n\nShe didn't try anything to make it up to me when she got back from funeral\n\n-you already celebrated\n-yeah but I want to celerbate with you",

    "selftext": "So me and my best friend, lets call her Stephanie, have been friends for 4 years.  We were more or less inseparable.  Still are very close, just don't have much time to spend with each other now that we are leading separate lives.  I have been fairly fortunate in terms of finance in my life and had more free time than her so I inevitably ended up doing more of giving in the relationship.  And I don't mind that at all, I give because I like to see my friends happy.  Anything she needed, I was there.  She was sick and I had a final, I was there at her place with homemade soup and cold medicine in couple hours and I just studied on the couch.  She needed a ride cause she was drunk at a frat party at 4am in the morning and I was sleeping, I was there.  Her birthday, I got her very thoughtful gifts i spent a fortune on.  She was suppose to move out of her apartment in 6 hours and hadn't started packing yet, I ditched my lunch date and was there in 30 minutes with boxes and tapes.  To me, these are just things you do for your best friend.  Yet my birthday, 3 years in a row, get no present or anything from her (in her defense there were excuses for 2 of those broke up with bf of 6 years, a funeral but still didn't even try to make it up to me afterwards, not so much as a card).  I needed help unpacking 3 boxes, refuse to lift a finger stating simply she didn't want to.  Needed a ride at 11pm at night to airport, she refuses cause she has work at 9am.  I'm sick so I needed her to pick up my dog from the vet, \"ugh I have exam in 3 days and need to study\".  Just some of many examples.  I finally had enough and I told her I was sick of doing all the giving in this friendship and she yelled back that she never asked for any of those things (which is only partially true) and that its not her fault she doesn't have as much money and time as me.  \n\n*important point\nI told her it wasn't about money or time or wanting anything in return from her for what I did.  Its that if she truly cared for me as much as she says she does and if she really considers me a best friend you should want to help me out when I need help.  Yelled at her that mere acquaintances have come through for me more than she has.  That I'm sick of her being selfish and that I never have been able to rely on her.  Told her my main issue is that true close friendship is suppose to be about willingness to sacrifice for each other and that you have, except on very rare occasions, done nothing for me that requires any kind of discomfort or hinderance on your part.\n\nIn her defense, its not like she does absolutely nothing.  When I need shoulder to cry on, she's usually there for me, even if its a day or two late cause she's busy.  If its during the day and not doing anything, she's given me rides a couple times.  Once in a blue moon she will make a nice gesture.  But majority of the time, I can't rely on her.  \n\nAITA for calling her selfish",

I lived with some of them last year, and they knew that often my gf would come over. I agreed to pay some more rent because of this before we signed the lease. After signing they had a meeting without me and decided that if a guest stays over the majority of the week that they would have to pay an equal share of utilities for that week. \n\nI felt that this was targeted at me and my gf (whom they don't like very much). I tried to reason with them that having someone over doesn't increase utility cost (we don't pay for water and having a guest in my room won't use any more electricity). They said that its unfair for her to benefit for free what we are paying for, my argument against that is that she would be a guest and guest shouldn't have to pay to stay over. When they wouldn't listen I offered that maybe the guest could pay some utilities but not an equal share but some smaller fraction they said no because it'd be ridiculous to measure how much utilities each person used. \nAdditionally, none of the four of us are paying for the house with our own money, everything is being paid for by parents, and its not as if any are short on money. \n\nFinally, they got mad because they said that they signed the lease expecting just those signed on the lease to be there and no one else, despite them knowing about my gf before signing the lease. Essentially they got mad that she would be around. Earlier this year one of my friends thought that I spend too much time with her so I think some of his anger came from that.\n\nI understand there point, and don't necessarily think they are wrong, but I feel as though they should have brought this up before signing the lease. So in addition to them making the rule without me and there unwillingness to negotiation, my biggest concern is that I don't want to live in a place where my gf will feel so unwelcome, which in turn makes me feel unwelcome. Ultimately I decided to live somewhere else and we found someone to replace me on the lease. So it all worked out on that end but this has impacted my friendship with these people in a strong way and I'm left wondering if I'm the asshole for not agreeing to pay more.\n\nTLDR: friends made rules without me after signing the lease, I argued and thought they were unreasonable, then got a replacement for the lease.\n\nedit: realized I have a typo in the title but can't fix it, please ignore.",

I work a 9-5 and he works scattered hours, so I take our son to and from daycare and have him all day on the weekends while he gets his days off kid free. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with my little man, but sometimes I just really need some me time. By the time he gets off work it's usually too late for me to go anywhere, and my weekends are shot because I have the babe all day. I have no family here, and the family he has here has stated that they don't intend on watching him. Not the best situation, but we're making it work. While he sleeps in and spends his days off with his friends, I can't help but get angry with him. I need sleep. I need time for me. If we have days off together he does let me sleep in, but that is so rare and on days when he works (usually 10 or later) he gets angry if he gets woken up and then throws the days that he let me sleep in in my face. He also thinks I should take vacation days for me time, but then who is going to have the baby on the holidays when the daycare is closed? I've also only been working at my job for a few month now and have just been cleared for holiday time while he's been at his job for almost a decade. I think it would look bad to take vacation so soon, but getting simple things done like my hair, or setting up a bank account are almost impossible for me with no help. ",

We\u2019ve all worked together to paint, sand, and tile and now we\u2019re at the point of getting the entertainment for this area. The Man Cave is, in theory, for everyone but in reality I will never use it. I have a nice TV in my bedroom, and am almost never home to use it as it is. When I do hang out with my friends it\u2019s literally never at my house. This is a thing for my 2 brothers to take advantage of, when their friends come over to watch a sports ball game or whatever. \n\nStill, even though I will not be using it I both offered and agreed to contribute my Xbox One to the project so that they can play their games and watch their shows. All that\u2019s left is acquiring TV, about $600-$1000 is what they\u2019re expecting to spend on a decent one. Well, now they (And by \u201cThey\u201d I mainly mean my dad) is trying to get me to go in about $200 on the TV. I\u2019ve tried explaining that my contribution was the Xbox and games which I could have easily sold for more than that amount (It\u2019s the Halo 5 Edition) and do not intend on contributing any cash. Aside from the fact that shelling out $200 would destroy my entire 2 week budget, which is tight in the best of times, I will not be using this area at all. I did not need to just give them my Xbox and games, and am getting rather pissed off at being pressured into helping with the TV as well. I get that splitting it 4 ways is easier than splitting it 3 but its money that I just don\u2019t need to spend on a luxury like that. \n\nBut now I\u2019m wondering; since this is technically a Family Project, Am I The Asshole for not wanting something towards the TV? \n\nEDIT: Additional Info\nI'm 26 Years old and living at home. I only live at home because most of my income goes to helping with household expenses, though some of it is cultural as well. \nI bought the Xbox and the TV in my room with my own money, the TV was purchased years ago. \n",

There was a guy behind me in a car with a much higher elevation, I think it was a Jeep. He aggressively beeped me 2 or 3 times, clearly saying \"Get on with it\" with his Jeep right up my backside. He could probably see further than I could in my hatchback. Several weeks ago I was involved in a minor car accident. It took them 2 and a half weeks to fix my car and I've only had it back for about 10 days so I'm being very careful with it and with myself.\n\nAnyway, I make the turn once I judge it's safe to so do (that is, when the number of cars dwindles, suggesting a red light earlier in the road) and the guy in the Jeep is right up my backside unecessarily. I flip him the bird. He goes nuts. He's flicking his headlights in my rear mirror (it's full daylight), continnuing to drive very close to me and then he swerves into the next lane to pull up alongside me but then drops back behind me as we are both turning off the road at the same exit. While we're stopped at traffic lights he beeps at me aggressively and flips me the bird through his windscreen and flicks his headlights again. I ignore him this time. He continues this through three more intersections (I am careful to brake and accelerate smoothly and indicate well in advance so he doesn't go up the back of me), tailgating me before I turn into the street where I live and he continues in another direction.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I didn't view flipping the bird as a very serious insult, but obviously he did.

I never posted and only stuck around because people would post all of their drama on the page. It essentially is one giant circlejerk of a pity party, and it was often an entertaining read.\n\nWell, this one girl has been making post after post that range from \"I don't want to be on this planet anymore. Fuck everything,\" to \"I am a worthless piece of trash who can't wait to die.\" \n\nMost recently, she posted yesterday saying \"I can't take this anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm so fucking suicidal.\" \n\nI work in social services, so I don't take this shit lightly. I've worked with several suicidal clients and patients and some have even ended up killing themselves once they were out of my care. I'm a huge advocate of recovery and I remember thinking to myself that if this poor girl were to actually follow through and kill herself, I would have to live with the fact that I did nothing.\n\nSo I left a comment suggesting that she goes to the hospital to get herself the help that she needs, and the whole group blew up at me. \"That's not helpful!\" \"Why are you making such drastic suggestions? Go fuck yourself!\" and so on and so forth. Whatever, I really don't give a shit about these people and what they think. I just want the girl to be okay. \n\nThen the girl says something along the lines of, \"When I choose to kill myself it'll be none of your business so let me do what I want!\" \n\nShe lives in my state, and my roommate actually met her in real life. I thought about how it would affect him if she went through with it. I thought about the girl's family. She sounded like she was in so much pain, and from what my roommate said about her, she can act very impulsively. So I called the non emergency police department, explained the situation, and gave them her name. \n\nTwenty minutes later, she tried calling my roommate; he didn't pick up, although I tried to encourage him to do so. After about two hours had passed, she had left the group and someone else posted:\n\n\"no one should really be calling police on someone. especially if you do not know them outside of the group. thats fucked, because most of the time its just simple venting in here. even if it is about a heavy subject. its neither your right nor you place to do that to someone unless you actually know them or unless they ask for that type of help. it really just adds more stress to a person when they have cops banging on their fucking door and trying to put them into an involuntary 5150 hold which also comes with its own problems.\"\n\nIt sounds like she wasn't admitted, and I'm just glad she's okay.

    "selftext": "So my cousin, \u201cKay,\u201d and I (we\u2019re both female) are very close in age and we grew up near to each other. All through our younger years, we were best friends. When we were both 10, we promised each other that we would be the maid-of-honor at each other\u2019s weddings. Then when we were in middle school, Kay moved away and we slowly drifted apart.\n\nFast forward 10 years.  I started to realize that our \u201cfriendship\u201d meant a lot more to Kay than it did to me. She was always the one calling/texting me to catch up, never the other way around. I just didn\u2019t feel like we had that much in common anymore. Frankly, trying to stay connected with her as much as she wanted was exhausting to me, and I began to get irritated at having to \u201cforce\u201d this friendship that my clingy cousin obviously wanted way more than I did. \n\nAll this came to a head in March when Kay announced her engagement to her boyfriend, \u201cJake.\u201d I\u2019ve only met the guy twice, and he seems nice enough, but I\u2019m having a hard time being enthusiastic about the marriage. Without going into the long details of why, I basically think Kay is too immature to get married right now.\n\nSo when Kay called me all excited about her engagement, I told her how I felt. She was very defensive and hurt over it. She wanted me to be excited for her, but I wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t see why I should force enthusiasm just to make her happy. This led to several weeks of silence between us, which was fine by me. \n\nThen Kay started to reach out to me again and try and bring me in on wedding plans, saying she still wanted me for her maid-of-honor. That\u2019s when I realized that it was stupid to keep doing this. I sent her a long text where I basically told her that I didn\u2019t want to be her maid-of-honor, and honestly I didn\u2019t really even want to be her friend anymore. Just because we are cousins, doesn\u2019t mean we have to be friends. \n\nNow all her friends and the most of our family have basically been calling me an asshole. They tell me I should be supportive and happy for my cousin and that she\u2019s devastated by my \u201cbetrayal.\u201d But I can\u2019t help having my opinions and feeling the way I do. Even though I know my text hurt Kay, wouldn\u2019t it have hurt her more to go through the whole thing as her reluctant maid-of-honor? AITA for finally being honest with her about our one-sided \u201cfriendship?\u201d",

It's a huge company with many many locations and its employees are known to have an attitude. Most of the employees in the store are actually really nice except for this one lady.. Basically, a year ago, I went into the store with 2 other friends and she and another employee really obviously followed us around, keeping an eye on us while pretending to fix shelves. It was in the way that you know they thought you were going to shoplift. We walked to different ends of the store just to test her and she followed us everywhere while being really, embarrassingly obvious. We were so uncomfortable that we ended up leaving without buying anything. That night, I wrote a negative review on their Facebook page calling those 2 employees out. I didn't state names or physical appearance. Now, whenever I go into the store, even a year later, that same lady always gives me dirty looks and talks about me to other employees while I am still in the shop. I know this because I can hear them and they turn around to look at me. So my question is, am I the asshole for calling her out?",

Their shopping carts have a slot to deposit a quarter to unlock  it, then you get your quarter back when you put the cart away. This allows them to not hire cart wranglers and keeps the parking lot clear.  \n\nI never carry change, and I almost always forget to bring a quarter shopping with me. Most of the time (like 90%) there is a buggy set aside, not in anyone's way but also not chained to the other carts. I use that one, then put it back where I found it (or close to the other carts if it was left in the parking lot when I found it.) I figure it's like an honor system thing. I needed a buggy and didn't have change, someone graciously left the quarter in there in case someone else might need it, and I did need it. I don't chain it back and take the quarter, but I also don't leave it in the parking lot or in the way. I simply leave it for the inevitable next person in my situation. \n\nToday a guy behind me put his cart back, got his quarter, then took my cart (which was in no way obstructing the aisle to the other carts), locked it up, and took that quarter too. He clearly saw me leave it, I feel like I was obviously intentional and not like I was just too lazy to lock it in (I walked it up like right next to the other carts). Someone said I was the asshole for not locking it up, but it wasn't my quarter to begin with and I didn't leave it on the lot, so I definitely disagree with that person. \n\n\nThis feels like a modern episode of Seinfeld, but seriously, am I the asshole here?",

The receptionist suggested that I use wax. I told her that the barber recommended hair gel. It was at this point where she just ignored what I said and continued recommending me other hair waxes.

I have spent the whole day traveling and am exhausted. My cab hit horrendous traffic on the way to the airport and my flight was delayed nearly 3 hours. If all that wasn't enough, we had my husbands family in town this week and as things went, I was gone basically their whole visit. So I went straight from the car lot to their hotel so we could at least greet each other. I got home after 10pm, which means I've been trying to get home for 12 hours. I didn't even unpack. I just freshened up and went to bed. He was asleep so I figured I'd read a bit to unwind before having to go back to work in the morning. \n\nI wasn't even in bed a minute and he woke up. I kissed him and said good night as I know he gets up super early. A minute passes and I just feel this giant boner pressing up against me. I ignore it and keep reading. He starts petting my arms and hand, so I take the hint and put down my phone. Then he just starts making out with me. I feel like this is bullshit. I JUST got home. Next he tries to go down on me, so I stop him and asked if it could just be a quickie. He gets offended and just stopped all together.

    "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short.  edit: *failed*, sorry.  TL;DR Idiot friend is an idiot, and I told him I'm done with him.  My life is better now.\n\nI had this friend, who I *thought* was a like-minded individual - we share the same taste in music, have generally the same outlook on life, we both play guitar, share a lot of other tastes too (like video games).  Up until last weekend, I used to have him come over every Saturday to game, until I just couldn't take it any more.  \n\nI'll start with the video games, which can be summed up in this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlandsPreSequel/comments/4ajbuq/how_do_you_deal_with_clueless_gamers/ - but let me add some more, as that post is one particular video game.  He, as I did, grew up playing video games.  You know people who, when they were little, spent a lot of time video gaming?  You know how they generally tend to be good at pretty much any game you throw at them?  Not this guy. Obviously I got tired of playing that game with him, so I spent the last five or six weekends trying out all kinds of different games, old and new, to try and find *something* that he'd be good at.  But it always ended up in the same fashion - He was completely incapable of working as a team, I had to consistently remind him to stay on the objective, at boss fights I would explain the mechanics (wasting my breath) as I just could not get *anything* at *all* through to his skull about what needs to be done.  I hated leaving him behind in BL TPS, so we played *tons* of other coop games (games he even played before), hoping one would activate something in his brain to become something close to a competent partner.  I couldn't take it any more - I wound up just getting so irritated and frustrated with him.  \n\nNow on to reality.  This guy hasn't had a job for about a year now.  All he does is read comic books at his tyrannical mother's house (those Saturdays spent with me were his only freedom from her).  The thing is, we would get really deep into some really good conversations - topics like how to make money without leaving your house, how the Dark Web works, how to do blah blah blah.  And what I would do after these conversations is do some research and email him some cool information I found on whatever topic it was, then I would tell him \"Hey, I sent you this email about that topic - check it out!  Let's see what else we can learn, or let's see if we could utilize this somehow.\"  And then he would never even *bother* to *open* the email.  I once even did a lot of research on  resume-building (how to best format a resume and what to say on it), and I asked him to send me his current one so I could touch it up for him.  Nothing.  \n\nNo ambition, no innovation, no drive, no proaction.  His actions both in and out of video games - if it requires the slightest bit of effort on his part other than opening his mouth (he loves talking), he could not be counted on in any capacity.  It's just so frustrating because I wanted to not only help him but help myself, too - If he had shown any inkling of enthusiasm about any of those topics, like how to make money without leaving your house (I sent him an askreddit thread about that which contained hundreds of ways to do it), we could have worked together to create something or do something that would better both of our lives.  \n\nBack in the day when anyone had any creative ideas, like putting our heads together to build a computer or explore a new part of town, everyone would get all excited about it and contribute and apply their intellectual abilities to make the idea a success. Or we'd all at least learn something from failing.  Nowadays I'm realizing nobody has that internal desire for exploration and discovery any more. They'll just stubbornly shake their heads at every new idea and point out all the reasons why it won't work or how it's too much effort.  I dislike this new defeatist attitude and unwillingness to innovate and learn. I'm assuming that attitude comes with age, but I know for sure that I personally have not lost my innate proclivity for edification (or desire for personal/intellectual enrichment).\n\nAnyway, he basically caused me too much unhappiness on my weekends (which, when you work full time and a half, is precious valuable time).  Of course he was oblivious to that, because I tend to act cheery even if I'm not, because that's what decent people do (if a game wasn't working out, I'd just suggest we move on to a different one).  So, I told him that I just can't have him over any more.  \n\nNow, I know this is reddit, and everyone here is a hipster who believes every life is valuable, and every person is created equal, blah blah sjw shit blah blah blah, and I'm a bad person because \"omg hurr durr he's lucky to get away from you, OP, you sociopath\".  Fuck you if you think that!  That dude *loved* coming over, and I bent over backwards to keep him happy, because I know he has a shitty life.  But, FUCK, I gotta be happy sometimes, too, you know?  That guy is the worst kind of toxic - the kind that is unintentional.  He just thinks he's living a normal life, and everything is hunky dory not having a job, and I just out of the blue was a huge asshole for telling him I can't hang out any more, and something must be wrong with me.  No.  That guy has no motivation to do anything, and that kind of attitude is toxic.  I want to *do* things.  Tell me, is it too much to ask of your friend to *read a fucking email*?  Is it too much to ask, when playing Halo, to *focus fire on the shield-regenerating enemies*?  That guy has a few screws loose in his head, and I'm happy to be without him.  I wish he wasn't like that, because honestly now I don't have anyone to play with, but this past Saturday was freaking great playing a single player game and relaxing and not internally screaming at an idiot right next to me.",

But it might be obvious though. \n\nRecently my partner told me they didn't much like their job with company car (I'll come back to that) etc, too much stress, and the management were d**ks...  My advice was to try to tolerate it a little while longer because it was a great job to have while looking for a better one. And it's usually easier to find a job when you have one..  And they weren't having much come back from applications (I thought anything better than nothing). \n\nP had an email from manager more recently, asking to meet and go through numbers and targets etc.  P took this as a imminent firing and immediately wanted to resign.  I suggest maybe that's the case, but go along,  be reasonable but stand up for yourself,  maybe ask to resign if he says that's it. P  didn't like this advice so went to their parents, to be told to do whatever they like,  and that I (me) should agree regardless. \n\nI have a little bit of savings that I've been putting by from my wages,  but also almost as much debt.  The savings are at a higher rate of interest than debt, so not paying off yet.  I may struggle to meet all the monthly bills etc, and I'm also slightly worried about my own job. \n\nI'm p**sed as I think this should have been a decision we both made.  Parents in law knew my thoughts.. \n\nIn the past, partner stated I'm better with finances so will trust me to handle that..  Given that Im the only party who knows the ins and outs of our financial situation, I'd have liked a bit more say in this decision. \n\nI've not really had any time for spouses parents since,  as it seems to me like they've interfered, and should have said it's between you 2, go discuss it more..  And they are now p**sed at me for not being \"supportive\". \n\nI think no one can see my side, which is making me feel like s**t.  \n\nTo add insult to injury, partner now needs a new car.  They were determined to get a brand new one on lease, I've had to beg to be more modest and get a used car outright from savings (meaning debts are now greater than savings). But at least no monthly commitment.  Partner said not good enough, want new...   but after many arguments came around to the idea of spending a bit less.\n\nNow I feel unappreciated,  disrespected,  and undermined. Like all the decision making privileges i thought I had a part of have been revoked, and that I've just gotta do as I'm told.  And that's making me stew and get even more riled up and possibly unreasonable... \n\nAm i being unreasonable? \n\nSorry for typos, on phone.\n\nUpdate:  Other half packing bags.

    "selftext": "I'm moving into my first apartment next month. I am 18 (almost 19) F, and I have three roommates who I think are 20ishF. We're all college students. Our apartment is a 4/4, so we each have our own bedrooms and bathrooms. All utilities are included in our rent except for electricity, which we split four ways and is usually very low from what I've heard. Two of the girls currently live there; me and another girl are replacing two other girls who are moving out.\n\nOne of my best friends \"Kayla\" is living in a dorm this year. She is working at a restaurant on campus, and needs to come up the week before school starts for job training. However, the dorm housing people didn't approve her request for an early move-in, so she doesn't have anywhere to stay for the four days before the dorms open. Naturally, I told her she was welcome to stay with me. I thought nothing of it since the only spaces I share with my roommates are the kitchen and the living room, and Kayla is incredibly shy so she won't be coming out there much anyway.\n\nMy roommates and I have a group chat that we made so we can see who has what for the apartment, decide what we still need, that sort of thing. A few days ago I texted the group chat and let them know that my friend Kayla would be staying with me from X date to Y date (four days).\n\nLater, one of my roommates \"Jordan\" replies, and her tone sounds really pissed off. It's probably pertinent to note that Jordan is one of the two who already lives in the apartment. I'd copy the whole text, but it was really long and pretty convoluted so I'll sum up. She basically said that that isn't the way we run things in the apartment, that we always get the other girls' permission before having guests, even if it's just for one night. She said she wasn't comfortable having a stranger in her home and asked me to tell Kayla she wasn't welcome to stay. The other two girls didn't say anything.\n\nI texted Jordan outside the group chat and told her that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend who needed a place to stay. I said I understand her concerns, and if I had someone who planned to stay longer than a week or so I would get everyone's approval first, but that I don't think I need her permission to host a guest in my bedroom for a couple days.\n\nJordan replied and brought up the electricity bill, and that she thinks it'll skyrocket with one more person staying there. (For four days?? I seriously doubt that, but I've never paid an electricity bill before so that's something I admit I'm in the dark on.) She said that if I insist on having an \"unwelcomed\" guest, I should pay more for the electricity bill that month. I told her we could talk about it when I move in in two weeks and didn't respond anymore.\n\nAITA for inviting my friend to stay in my room with me? I didn't think there was any way I could be since I have my own space, but now I'm not so sure. Is asking permission for every guest excessive, or is my roommate right? Should I offer to pay more for the electricity?",

    "selftext": "I am 22 years old, male.\n\nMy dad was a verbally abusive alcoholic towards me and my mom. He never quite veered into physical with me, but he had beat on my mother several times throughout my life. I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.\n\nMy dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had \"got better.\" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)\n\nI thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to. I was able to get him to give me POA, but at this point it was too little too late with nothing but a nicely worded \"Tough shit\" from the social worker who was helping me.\n\nI have told my mom's side of the family that I don't want to take care of him and that I, quite honestly, don't feel a shred of sympathy for him and they offer verbal support and say they don't blame me one bit. My dad's side, however, says I'm \"morally obligated\" to take care of my father regardless of how he treated me growing up (They also say he couldn't help the drinking nor the abuse since it's \"in the genes\") and that I'm a disgusting human being for not sympathizing with him for (probably) putting himself in this condition, occasionally saying if I don't I will have \"Failed my mom\". So, are they right? AITA?",

    "selftext": "I've been working at a restaurant now for about 3 years. I've worked night shifts since the day I started and make pretty good money for a busboy (I don't think this job is your average busboy job, we do quite a bit of work).\n\nThere is a morning server, Regina, that nobody wants to work with and for good reason. Regina works Monday to Friday and she's the only morning server. She tips WAY below what other servers tip and on top of that asks you to do half of her work. So you work twice as much and make a 5th of the money you would make working nights. In addition, we found out she had been lying to former busboys that worked with her when we found out she had been telling them that she doesn't get paid from parties (big groups that come in a couple times a week). Regina had them convinced she just did it out of the kindness of her heart apparently. We told the manager, Deb, all about this stuff so she is fully aware of what this server does. As far as I know, Deb never did anything about it.\n\nAnyway, every busboy is either quitting or coming up with reasons as to why they can't work with Regina and eventually the owners found out about this and demanded Deb put on a busboy for morning shifts. As far as I know, Deb never told the owners why nobody wants to work with Regina. Maybe she did and the owners didn't care... I'm not sure. I'm not really sure what the situation is there.\n\nAnyway, I come back from vacation to find out I have three morning shifts with this server. Frustrating that they'd put me on mornings when I told them multiple times I refuse to work with Regina until she starts doing her share of the work and tipping her busboys appropriately (something that hasn't happened since I started working there three years ago). Not a big deal though, right? I'm just going to call off. Come up with an excuse as to why I cannot work the mornings like all the other busboys. Wrong. Deb says to me, \"If you call off you will be fired.\"\n\nI thought about quitting right there on the spot, but instead decided to go into work and sit in the break room until the shift was over. Before I did that I told Deb \"I am doing the minimal amount of work. I'm going to do what she tips for (which is basically resetting tables and carrying bus pans to the dish washer)\" and she said that's fine.\n\nHalfway through the shift Deb comes in and begins to yell at me for not helping enough. She sends me home (I'm assuming I'm going to get fired) and here I am typing this.\n\nAm I the asshole? I ask because Deb basically made me feel like the asshole. That she doesn't have a choice on whether or not I work mornings. That I'm in the wrong and that Regina isn't and that I didn't give her a chance (though I have in the past, but that's a different story). I don't know....\n\nAlso, to put this in perspective.... I can work 1 single night shift that lasts between 6-7 hours and make anywhere from 60-130 dollars while morning busboys work 5 5-6 hour shifts and make less than I made in that single night. They generally make between 40-65 dollars a week. That is how unfairly this woman tips her busboys.\n\nEdits: Spelling, words, etc.",

While many others on the trip are friends of mine as well, I am not good enough friends with any of them that I would be going if my buddy who invited me was not.  In a beach house with a max of 16, I believe the current head-count is 14.  And me, Mr. Bc43004, is the only single man and perhaps one of two non-family members.  \n\nAnyway, knowing this would be a week's summer vacation, I knew I would not have much of a good time if I were to share a bedroom with someone who may border on total stranger.  I am a 33 year old single man who's not much interested in rooming up with another dude, a woman I'd be very unlikely to have sex with, or God forbid any of the teenage boys going on the trip who would inevitably draw dicks on my face with a sharpie on the nights I pass out drunk.  It was a standard request as part of the buying terms that I do not co-habitate.  My friend said that made sense and we made it part of the deal.\n\nAnyway, this is a family vacation that I was invited to participate.    I really don't want anyone to have to crash on sofa-beds, but I also really don't want to share a bedroom.  Say we arrive, and as an outsider I'm outnumbered 11-3 that I should share the bedroom to prevent someone from air-mattressing, am I the asshole if I say absolutely not?  I made it clear from the get-go I would pay a premium for the single's room, though my buddy did not charge me said premium.  For that reason, I am currently receiving a hell of a bargain.  \n\nCurious to everyone's thoughts.  \n\nTL;DR: Going on a family vacation but it is not my family's vacation.  I do not wish to share a bedroom no matter how crowded the beach house may be because it's not what mid-30's single men with jobs do.\n\nEdit: Well it seems as though the masses think I'm either an asshole or one in the making.  Which is fine, that's why I posed the question.  Now knowing this, I will compromise should a conflict arise next week to sharing a room but certainly not a bed.  Then remind myself I'm on vacation and should consider myself fortunate.  Thanks everyone!",

Right after I moved in he messed up the bathroom sink by taking it apart when something of his fell down the drain.\n\nIt stayed like that for over a week, so I messaged the landlord about both issues.

It's over 30 Celsius in the rest of the house and he doesn't open his door to share at all, and won't unless the roommates chip in $200 each to help pay for the unit.  Basically the rent's going to be raised for 7 people to pay for his comfy room while the rest of the house is miserable.\n\nI really like this house.  It's exactly what I'm looking for and I know my roommate isn't very invested in it.\n\nI want to tell the landlord about the air conditioner so at the very least the people who live downstairs, who are rarely home don't have their rent increased.  But I know she's going to be pissed at my roommate, and I'm not sure if the lease specifies if we're allowed one or not.\n\nI feel like I'm being a jerk and should just keep my mouth shut considering how recently I moved it, but at the same time he's a pretty bad roommate.

    "selftext": "TLDR: Electrician gave expectation over the phone, provided another. My mother said something she shouldn't have to electrician. Electrician calls and yells at me. Does not give me opportunity to explain the situation. I eventually yell back and leave a bunch of nasty reviews and call them out on their irrational unprofessional behavior. I still feel shitty about it and wonder if I did something wrong.\n\n-------------------------\n\nIt's a long explanation. I'm agonizing over this and it's pretty complicated to me. At this point I have a fleeting concern that an angry, emotionally unstable electrician is going to come and burn my house down or something irrational.\n\nI call a 24 hour electrician late at night to help with a concerning power issue in my home (partial power outage to half my house). My wife and I both work, we have two young kids, one of the grandparents will come over and watch the kids during the day. I live in a small town and our choices of service providers is pretty limited.\n\nElectrician guides me through some troubleshooting over the phone at about 9:30 PM and believes it may be an issue for the power company and that the power company will do it for free. However the power company may not respond quickly enough and they'd be willing to come out at 7:30 AM the next day to check it out. They'd charge $75-$90. I accept as I can't really risk not having power in my home for a few days by dragging my feet.\n\nThey come out, my mother is at my home as I told them. They indeed identify the issue as something for the power company to resolve and facilitate getting them to come out, etc. So far I've had an excellent experience with this company.\n\nThey tell my mother it was $150. I didn't tell my mother how much to expect, but my mother is scrutinizing and asks why it's so much when all they did was check my meter and tell us it's not a problem for them to fix. My mother claims they tell her it's because they sent two technicians out, and that she only ever saw one. She pays them with a check I left (as they don't take credit cards). Power company comes out and fixes my issue for free.\n\nWhatever, $150 isn't a big deal to reward their excellent service. My mother won't drop it and keeps telling me I should cancel the check or tell them we'll mail them a check for a different amount.\n\nMy wife and I don't care to make a big deal about it. Our power is fixed, they responded quickly and we accepted them to come out. They may have charged us more than they said they would, but I like to pick my battles.\n\nThe next day I get a call from the woman who I spoke to two nights ago to set up the appointment. She immediately beings SCREAMING at me over the phone. Literally no break for me to interject. She is livid over me threatening to stiff her, that they've been in business for over 30 years, they're licensed and insured, and that she told me there was a charge to come out, etc. Imagine all that in capital letters and you pretty much got it.\n\nI guess my mother called them on my behalf and voiced her concerns to them.\n\nShe literally will not stop yelling to allow me to interject. Even if I try to talk over her she just keeps yelling. All I'm trying to do is explain to her that I'm not cancelling my check, that I appreciated their service, and that my mother may have said something that she shouldn't have. Things start to get a little bit heated as I become more forceful with my attempts to get her to calm down, but those efforts are useless and she continues to yell until she hangs up on me.\n\nI call back and try to re-establish the conversation from a calmer level. I even begin by telling her exactly what I was trying to explain in the previous phone call. It's like she didn't even hear me. She immediately begins yelling at me again. I've had it at this point, and I'm starting to take it personally that she's treating me like an asshole. And even if she's understandably mad at my mom, I don't like being yelled at. I start yelling back, swearing and calling her all sorts of horrible things until she hangs up again.\n\nShe ignores any attempt for me to call or text back for over 24 hours.\n\nI send a few emails to the company explaining the situation and trying to come up with a satisfactory resolution to this customer experience. I ask very plainly why there was a difference in the expected charge and the amount we ended up paying and that, in either case, I don't plan on cancelling any payments.\n\nI also take the time to leave some pretty scathing reviews on a variety of business review sites.\n\nFinally get an email back two days later. It's the same woman (starting to realize this company is just her and her husband). She accuses me of being a misogynist(for my choice of female-oriented swear words used during my yelling match on the phone) and that I'd have never said those things if a man had been the one to talk to me. Remember I wasn't there for the appointment, and that my only experience with this woman was over the phone, so I guess she assumed that I was treating her like some lowly phone operator or something. She ignores my question asking for clarification of charge.\n\nI send her another email reply as it's my only avenue of communication. She again bitches at me in the email, but I think I got the impression that I was charged extra for her talking to me on the phone late at night to set up the appointment, and also for the troubleshooting that she performed over the phone. She says that she needs to get to work and she's done talking to me. If this is the case, it's the absolute first time I've been made aware of this. I was not aware at the time I was going to be charged for the phonecall to set up an appointment where she opted to do the troubleshooting with me. And even then, why did she specifically lead me to expect a charge of $75-$90. In either case, I don't care as I just wanted to be done with it and $150 was a small price to pay to be done with this ordeal. And if her time is so important she sure didn't save herself any time by being so belligerent with me.\n\nI'm not taking my reviews down. I'm convinced that the lady is emotionally unstable and I hope that my negative reviews costs them more than the $50 they agonized over with me. \n\nAm I the asshole? I sure feel like she thinks I am, although I'm not sure what I could have done different to prevent this problem. I feel a little guilty lowering myself to her level and escalating the phone conversation more than it was, but I didn't know what else to do. I acknowledge that my mother may have started the conflict, but I think it was very inappropriate for her to not try to resolve the issue with me more professionally. Is it appropriate for me to leave multiple bad reviews on various sites based on my interaction, even if the service was exceptional? I'm sure I shouldn't have resorted to yelling back (even after my calmer attempts failed), but should I have tried a different approach?

    "selftext": "Alright so this is kind of a two parter. First part was last year. I'm living in an apartment complex where me and my buddies have essentially taken over the whole thing. Only a couple apartments in the building don't belong to us. Anyway we're loud and rowdy pretty much all the time but we've learned to get along with the few neighbors who aren't a part of our group. They have our numbers (well, not mine, but others who are in charge) and will call if there is a problem.\n\nSo with this in mind I played music fairly loud last year while in my apartment. Not loud enough for my roommate who lived right next door to complain (he has bad hearing though) but pretty loud. And pretty late at night. Never gave much thought to it. And I had a big wooden stick to hit the ceiling with if my buddy up there was being too loud and he would do the same to me.\n\nSo the end of the year rolls around and my roommate tells me he talked to the guy living below me who said he had been bothered all year by the music coming from above him (coming from me). Well shit I felt like a bit of an asshole but then I thought why the hell didn't he ever say anything? Or hit his ceiling to let me know? I would have turned it down no problem. Even worse (I almost didn't want to include this) he's a fucking grad student in medical school, which I know is incredibly hard work and sleep is very important for someone doing that sort of thing. Also the school I'm at is notorious for nerdy introverts who avoid conflict. I find this all out only like a week before I move out of the place.\n\nSecond part is right now. New apartment. Started to play music but then thought of that poor fucking grad student. Was thinking of going down and just like asking the neighbors to let me know if I'm being too loud? This is kind of a bad neighborhood so I don't know if I'm gonna come off as a creep or something. I also have no fucking clue what the acoustics in this place are like if they can even hear me. So what's the protocol here? I might have been an asshole in the first incident so I'd like to try and make sure I'm not gonna be an asshole again.",

He is 10 years older than me (I'm in my late 20s so dont worry about me being underage, lol) and has been having health problems even before we've gone out. It's never bothered me before but lately I just feel like his health issues affect our life together.\n\nFor example we plan dates (dinners, hikes, movies, outings with friends and etc) &amp; vacations but they ALWAYS get postponed or even cancelled indefinitely because my bf gets stomach cramps and the shits. It's been bad enough that he even calls in sick to work and just stays at home resting and has to be near the washroom.\n\nNormally occurs when he eats something (ex. Too spicy, fast food, too greasy, too much dairy, etc). I have been for the past year, suggesting he should just stop or avoid eating those and take probiotics and to go see a doctor to see if he has something like an ulcer or ibs or just a sensitive gi system or something else, as it occurs even if he eats just the smallest amount of the food BUT he REFUSES TO SEE A DOCTOR or AT LEAST TRY NOT EATING THE POSSIBLE FOOD THAT MAY AFFECT HIM!!!\n\nI get so frustrated because I can't stand it when he's in pain but I also can't stand having to drop everything planned (whether if its for us, with friends or family) just to stay and help him. I've seriously considered breaking it off with him because if he does not care to try anything to help himself why should I be wasting my time trying to help him if its a futile cause. He'd get over these gi episodes but it will occur again in a cycle and each time he will refuse to get medical help. I'm not the only who tells him to see a doctor, his family, friends and even employer/employees have all talked to him about it.\n\nI just can't deal with the fact that I may be \"nursing\" him to health everytime something happens and cancel plans for the rest of my life. I feel like its the same as if I am taking care of my elderly parent, and not something I should be doing for a bf so early in life.\n\nEdit: bf finally went to the doctors, after some blood tests, he is now on meds for suspected ulcers. Hopefully it works. Thank you to everyone for their insights and suggestions. Really appreciate the help!",

For awhile I was a little short on money so I took the work on a contract basis to make ends meet, while making it clear to him that my primary job takes priority. Problem is, as a full-time employee I made a decent wage at my old job, though I didn't really get many raises over the 9 years so by the end it was just an \"okay\" wage. However, as a contractor, there is no way in hell I would accept that little. I could easily charge three times the amount for any other client if that's the type of work I wanted to do, but he only offers to pay me my old wage per hour. And when he offers for me to do half an hour of work here and there, it's honestly not worth the time taken to create the invoices.\n\nDave reached out again recently and asked if I'd do more work for him and I declined, and let him know that work has gotten more busy and my schedule has changed so I would no longer be able to help. I am also dealing with some anxiety issues lately and am feeling overwhelmed without the added work and pressure.\n\nDave emailed me again twice in the last two weeks asking for help again, this time desperate, using words like \"YIKES URGENT HELP\" and asking me to instead train him, a mostly computer illiterate person on how to do something very technical. There's just no way. I have ignored both emails, but I know he really has no other options at this point.\n\nSo... am I the asshole for ignoring him?\n\n\n**Edit**: One thing to add about why I chose to ignore the emails rather than decline again. I know that if I respond and tell him no, he will continue to email me and try to \"bargain\" and pressure me into doing something for him. There is just no way that this will end quickly with a single email back.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am 16 years old, and I recently got a part-time job as a waitress. I've been working for a bit more than a month (four weeks). My parents says that they are proud of me and  that they are happy that I have it. \n\nMy family has a beach house where my parents occasionally spend the weekend. My mom said in the beginning of the summer that they will not be going every weekend, only once or twice (this is important later). I almost always work the weekends, so I am not able to join them. Note that I am too young to drive, so my mom would drive me to work. \n\nThe first weekend that I worked, I asked my mom to stay home to drive me, because I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong. That went fine, there were no issues. \n\nThe next weekend, my parents were away, so I didn't have a ride. This is when it gets a bit nasty. My mom and I had a huge argument about me being ungrateful for her driving. (Not in a verbal sense. She said that I thank her enough vocally, but that I still don't mentally appreciate how she goes out of her way to drive me to places. I was kind of confused, but this isn't what the post is about). \n\nShe was especially mad that I didn't sort out the driving situation myself. My thought process was that she normally drives me, so she would be the one to sort it out when she was away. I realize that I shouldn't have just assumed this, and I think I was the asshole in that situation, but this post isn't about that. In the end, I took the bus, as per her suggestion. (This was quite inconvenient, as it ran late and made me late for work, and I had to walk home, which is quite far away). \n\nThe day of the argument, I heard her talking about me on the phone with my dad, and she called me a mean person with no respect for other people. This is when it hit me that I made a mistake. I apologized for the incident as soon as I was able to stop crying. This really hurt me, and I kind of became a mess for a few days. I didn't really talk, and I wrote a suicide note (I didn't intend on attempting anything, don't worry, I just had to get it out), and it was just a very bad time for me.  Since then, I have been trying very hard to become a good person. Really, this is not a new issue for me, but this showed me just how urgent it is. \n\nSo basically, that whole situation is a VERY touchy subject. School is starting soon, so next weekend is my final weekend. I told my mom my schedule next week, and she said that we'll probably have to sort something out again with driving (this will be the third time). I said something along the lines of \"huh, it looks like you and dad did go to the beach house most weekends.\" I was annoyed, because taking the bus was very inconvenient. Because of this, I probably sounded pretty annoyed when I said that. Anyway, she got quite upset at me. She brought up the times where she had stayed here just to drive me, and how I am not grateful enough. I quickly apologized, and she walked away mumbling something I couldn't hear. I'm thinking going back up to apologize again tonight, but it is a little late, so I will probably wait until tomorrow. The mere thought of her having another discussion with my dad like the one she had before is enough to make me cry. \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR my mom and I got into an argument about how I am ungrateful, I apologized, I brought it up again, she got angry with me\n\nThanks!\n\nUPDATE: In case anyone cares, here is an update. My mom initially didn't remember what I said when I apologized for the first time. After a refresher, she got angry at me for bringing it up again. Once she calmed down and finished what she was saying (basically the same thing she said during the initial argument, she said how I am ungrateful for how much she is doing for me), I told her that I realize I was wrong for assuming that she will do things for me, how I was being mean, and that I appreciate what she does. She didn't respond after that. It lasted maybe 5 minutes.\n\nI don't think I really got my message through. But I don't know if it would be a good or bad idea to apologize again, because she seems to not want to dwell on it. But she didn't acknowledge any apology I have made yet, so she clearly still hasn't forgiven me. We used to have such a good relationship, basically a friendship, but every time I am around her now I just feel bad knowing that I screwed up so badly that she can't forgive me. I really screwed this up, I can't believe how badly I've handled everything. Our relationship went from being so close to walking on eggshells, all because I screwed up. \n\nI guess all I can do at this point is to not interfere with her life by asking for things that she doesn't owe me. I don't know, there must be more I can do to fix everything, I really screwed up, guys... ",

She looked at me and said \"Will you help me buy a car?\" I said \"How?\" She replied, \"Just help pay for it.\" \"How much?\" I asked. \"All of it.\"\n\n             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong. We fight almost all of the time. In fact, almost all of our fights end with her threatening to leave, so because she does this often, I usually reply with \"Fine, go ahead,\" or something along those lines. I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, \"Babe, you know I can't give you all of it.\" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, \"Yeah, I know,\" but instead she asks, \"Why not?\"\n\n          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, \"Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little.\" \"What do YOU need it for?\" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. \"I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all.\" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, \"I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.\"\n\n            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, \"Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked out or medical bills.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" she said, \"I have my answer. I can't imagine being with someone who wouldn't do all that they can for the one their with AFTER SIX YEARS.\" We then argued about who was in the wrong. We stopped and she laid down facing the other way, and I did the same. She shut off the TV and we fell asleep without saying a word. SO, if I'm the asshole, please let me know and I will grovel my way back into her good graces.",

    "selftext": "So it's the last weekend before we begin school, and a friend (we'll call him L) is going down to his dad's house for the weekend, and I end up tagging along, it's about 30 miles away, just a town over, no biggie. When I'm all packed up and ready to go with my 1200$ PC and PS4 (this is important for later) he says that he's going to go paintballing on Sunday (today) and if I want to come along, I really don't want to this weekend, maybe next weekend I say. He's fine with that but is still going to go this weekend with the other friend with us (we'll call him C), since we're taking his car down there (my car is getting fixed right now so I can't just follow him) we decide we'll just wing it tomorrow and find a way to get me home. We arrive, have a great night playing No Man's Sky and see Sausage Party and end up deciding that I'll ask my mom to meet me about halfway to our home the next morning before my friends go to paintball, she agrees, my friends agree.\n\nNext morning L says that he wants to get to paintball around 10:30 (right as it opens) and play till 4 (when it closes), and have enough time to make a stop before he gets to paintball. I tell him that probably won't happen since my mom is going to church at 9 this morning, won't be out till 10 and she won't arrive at our meeting place until at least 10:15, meaning it's going to be at the earliest 11 before he can get to paintball. Well this obviously is to big of a demand for me to make and he starts ranting about how \"YOU KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO PLAY PAINTBALL TODAY AND YOU STILL CAME DOWN HERE WITHOUT A WAY TO GET BACK.\" But we agreed that we'd make sure I got home, I'm just asking him to slightly inconvenience himself for me. But that is a big deal according to him, so what he wants to do is drop me off at our meeting place (a slightly shady gas station) and just leave me there with around 2000$ worth of electronics with me and just have me wait there for about 30 minutes until my mom gets there. Now I know the odds of anything bad happening to me in that little time are very very low, but I'm just really confused as to why he can't just wait with me until she gets there. If our roles were switched and he had to make me late for it, hell even a couple hours late for it, I would bite the bullet and be the good guy. Just patiently wait with my friend and not just ditch him on at a gas station right off the highway. And even after I tell him that my mom hasn't even texted me telling me she's left yet (which she said he would) and that I'd like to at least wait until she tells me she's headed here just to be safe. Which even further pisses him off, and at this point I don't know what to say, he just keeps pulling the \"YOU KNEW WE WERE GOING TODAY AND YOU STILL CAME WITH US!\" on me. At the gas station he just sits there with me and when my mom is running 5 or so minutes late he just starts backing out and says \"I'm sorry but if you don't get the fuck out I'm just taking you with me, I can't wait any longer for this bullshit.\" So I get out and my mom pulls up less then a minute later and that's basically it. \n\nSo what I'm getting at is, Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to slightly inconvenience himself for me? I feel like it's just expected that you just wait with the guy even if it means that you have to run a little late.",

For non mundane (aka magical/awakened) characters this is how effective your magic is and if you lose essance you lose magic, you can get it more of it to make up for the loss through exp, known as karma in this system, but most magic users only get very little and only if nessisary. Now you don't lose 1 ESS per piece of 'ware it depends on how invasive it is, replacing an eye takes very little, but replacing your entire nervous system takes a lot, and better grades of 'ware use less ESS as well. I think that covers the basics.\n\n**Experienced shadowruners start reading again**\n\nSo the homebrew rule was as follows: Characters must stay above one essance\" normally you have to stay above zero. Now this may not sound too bad but, that's about 15% of your potential for advancement gone as a mundane character, and the ablility to spend essance like that is a mundane's only real advantage, but my big issue was that he didn't put up anything to offset it. It's like in D&amp;D where fighters don't get anything special but they get a metric assload of extra feats and then you take away those extra feats. \n\nNow here's where the 100% I was an asshole part comes in, I argued this, for several hours, and enough that the GM was ready to not run the game. Now I didn't inturpt a session, and the game hasn't started yet. He did eventually see my side and we did make up after. But still, I want to know if you guys think this is justifiable or not. I'll be around here and there if anyone needs any clarification on anything I said.",

    "selftext": "This is probably going to be rather emotional but I'll try my best to not make it onesided. Here's my backstory on this whole mess, for context. Tl;dr at the end of the backstory.\n\nI've lived alternatively between my mom and stepdad, and my dad and stepmom for my whole life. I'm currently 19, living at home to save up money before I move out this fall.\n\nEver since I was about 9, my stepdad and I have had issues. Before me, he was very hostile toward my older sister, who was a young teen at the time. I vividly remember him getting in her face, absolutely screaming, before slamming her laptop down, bruising her fingers. This was a regular thing, he would get in our faces and just scream at us frequently.\n\nWe chose to live with my mom more often because my dad and stepmother were alcoholics who hardly had food for us. So some screaming seemed okay in exchange for regular food.\n\nWhen I turned a bit older, about 13, I was dealing with a lot of depression and an undiagnosed personality disorder, so at 13 I tried to kill myself. We were supposed to visit my stepdad's family the next day(it was around christmas time) and when I woke after my failed attempt, I just locked my door and refused to go to the family event. My family didn't know what I'd attempted. They came in and we argued for a while before my stepdad forcefully grabbed me and dragged me through the house and threw me into his car. It doesn't seem like a big event but I still haven't fully gotten over it. I think it's the main reason I'm terrified of large men to this day.\n\nDuring the argument I revealed what I'd tried, so after my stepdad threw me into his car my mom said her and I were staying home, and that she was taking me to a mental hospital.\n\nSo my stepdad leaves, my mom goes into my room to throw away sharp objects as the mental hospital employee told her. I called 911 while she did this and told the local police officer I was transferred to that I didn't feel safe in my home, and told her about my stepdad. She didn't seem concerned at all, and my mom then snatched the phone and told her everything was fine. They were joking and laughing about it. Then she hung up and I was taken to a mental hospital, where I stayed for a few weeks.\n\n**tl;dr:** stepdad is verbally abusive through my and my sibling's childhoods, after a suicide attempt by me he turns physical and throws me into his car forcefully\n\nFast forward almost 7 years, I still have mental issues that stem from that whole event. I'm living with my mom and stepdad now. Things have been okay off and on. The only issues we've had have sprouted up from him finding something to nitpick. Things like socks and clothes on my floor while I'm at work, me not working enough hours(anything under 60 is apparently not enough in his eyes), or a door being open with the screen shut(he's paranoid people will steal things, despite our 3 giant dogs).\n\nI do my best to not break their rules but inevitably I slip up every so often and it results in him screaming in my face. He always brings up unrelated things, about how much he works and that I'm just lazy and a mooch and useless. For the record, I am paying rent while I live here, I pay 1/2 of my biweekly paycheck which makes it really difficult to save enough to move out. In addition I clean up after myself and my younger brother. I take all the hours I can but working retail I can barely scrounge 30 hours. Anyways.\n\nMy mother and I just got in a huge fight and he decided to jump in and start screaming about how useless I am and telling me to go live with my father, that I don't know anything and how stupid I am because I don't work as much as he does. It ended with me self harming for the first time in months. I lost so much blood I'm dizzy and lightheaded. Anyways.\n\nI want to understand his perspective. I really want to. He does work hard, and he works a lot. He works 5 days, and sometimes take side projects on the weekends. He works construction. I understand that at the end of the day he's tired but he doesn't do anything once he gets home besides yell at me or my mom. My mom works the same amount of hours(as a pharmacy tech) but when she gets home, she has to dote on him, make him food, bring his clothes to him, rub his feet, all while he lays on the couch watching his tv shows(my mom has to wait until he's asleep to watch her shows) for 5-6 hours every night. Aside from that all he does is smoke and drinks a load of beer. \n\nI keep finding myself being onesided on this, sorry. It's been a really emotional night. I'm honestly somewhat worried for my safety living here. He's a gun fanatic and has so many of them. He doesn't hunt.  I don't know why he has so many loaded guns around. It's terrifying being in this house. If he was angry enough I don't doubt what he could do.\n\nI guess this ended up being more /r/rant material. Either way I hope someone here can help me see his side of things more. I don't want to hate him so fiercely, or be so terrified of him. I don't feel like he's done enough to justify my fear or hatred. I feel like maybe I really am just an ungrateful spoiled child who should be thankful for the house I live in. I'd rather feel appreciative and thankful than hateful and scared. I hope this was the right place to post to get a better perspective on the situation. Sorry again for the long post.",

That I don't want money to get in the way of our friendship.  \n  \nCouple months later I find out he's also bought a phone (Also an installment payment) and he's gotten rid of the previous car in favor of another one. At this point I feel violated. Instead of paying me back a little every month he has three installment payments (PC, phone, the 2nd car), a membership to a gym and can still afford gas for his car.  \n  \nI've talked with him and while he says he'll get the money our friendship is definitely ruined now. His argument is that I told him to forget about the money, mine that he was never honest with me about his financial situation. AITA?  \n  \nNon-native speaker, excuse any confusion please.  \n  \nEDIT: Please see my response to /u/BrainDojo's comment for further details.",

When I was ordering my food, I asked the waitress if I could order it now but have it at the end, she said \"Yeah, I'll have them make it and put it in the freezer\" I told her I didn't want that, I wanted it made at the end and before I could say I'd wait to order it she said she could do it that way too.\n\nA few times during my meal she asked did I want the malt yet and I reiterated that I would let her know when I was ready. After the meal I was signing the CC receipt I told her I was ready for the malt whenever she was (lazy day today, in no hurry) and I  saw her turn to the freezer and pull out the malt.....\n\nSo I asked her how long the malt was in there and if I wasn't clear about not wanting the malt until I asked for it and she said she had the guy make it \"like three minutes ago\" and was pretty visibly annoyed when she said she can make it again if I want.

So recently she has been spending more and more time with this guy we both have know now for little over a year now. Usually I don't really care who she talks too but lately I've noticed how much they talk, and how close they are getting... Like really uncomfortably close....\nExamples are sometimes I'll ask to Skype with her, but she'll refuse, but turn around and Skype this guy for hours. Other times she'll talk about things and make jokes she wouldn't usually make around me when she's with him. Now mind you I wouldn't have these suspicions if she first hadn't already have cheated on me a while back. She also broke up with me for another guy, just to be broken up with a month later. Recently she had this girl send her a picture if her tits behind my back, claiming that they were just friends, and that that was something girls do.

This guy, Bob, takes 3 ramens from me and my bf's personal closet area without asking us. I see the ramen on my roomie's Facebook feed and confront them. I tell Bob not to take things that are not his without asking. He says it's just ramen and my bf is the one who paid for it, so it's not mine anyway. I tell him it doesn't matter if it was caviar or dirt, he shouldn't take things that do not belong to him and that I am actually the one who buys all the food in the house with my own money.\n\nAnd I realize ramen is inexpensive (this was on the more expensive side as they were $2 each). It wasn't about the ramen, it was about the principle of it. You just don't take things that aren't yours. I would've given him some if he had just asked me. He has a history of imposing himself and basically being a leech, so I also didn't want to set a precedent that he can just come in and take whatever he wants.

How my school works is that, once you enter the cafeteria, you can't leave until lunch is over. If you try, you'll be sent back into the lunchroom. She and I both know this. That made going to her out of the question. She *had* to come to me. Our cafeteria has an indoor and outdoor section. It's pretty well known, too. She's been here for a year now. It's not exactly hidden.\n\nMy point of view is thus: Why should I have to convince her to come sit with me? If she didn't want to, fine. If she wanted to, cool. But don't complain that you're lonely and make me fucking negotiate with you to come sit with me. There was nothing coming after the \"but\" either.

    "selftext": "So to preface this, I'm a white guy and I've been working as a delivery driver for a Mexican restaurant for over 6 months now. \n\nAs part of the perks of my job I get free meals. When employees order food we usually just write what we want down on a piece of paper and hand it to the chefs. \n\nI've been noticing lately that a lot of the chefs seem kind of cold to me. I'm a naturally shy and timid person in general and I'm not good at asking other people for help. It's also loud inside the restaurant. The chefs are always busy so I feel awkward already about asking them to take my order, and not all of them speak good English so there's  also kind of another divide there too. \n\nI'm making this post because I've noticed that some of the chefs who I used to be cool with have started being kind of cold to me. I think it's because I only talk to them when I'm asking them to make me food. I noticed this especially yesterday and also today. Yesterday when I was asking one of the chefs to take my order it was the first time I had talked to him all day, and I noticed a new employee kind of looking at me funny when I did so. Today the same thing, when I asked another chef if he could take my order I noticed other people in the restaurant looking at me like I had said something wrong. I feel like the chefs think I'm bossing them around, which I absolutely am not. Another employee had sort of admonished me already about how I asked the chefs to take my order, when I asked them in English she told me how to ask them in Spanish, say please in Spanish, and correctly pronounce the chefs name. \n\nI feel like they're really just being oversensitive because I'm white. There have been other Mexican drivers here and they are even more direct with the chefs than I am. I think the fact that I'm white and don't speak Spanish creates kind of a natural divide between me and the employees compounded by the fact that I dont work in the kitchen. I think it's sort of unfair for them to treat me like I'm some kind of racist or like I think I'm better than them because of the nature of the work, and I'm not asking them for something special because the drivers are SUPPOSED to get free meals already. We don't get paid hourly, only in delivery fees and tips so the free meals are kind of a big deal. \n\nI just don't understand how what I'm doing is offensive. I'm already a naturally shy and introverted person. I talk to the other drivers and am friends with the other drivers because we all hang out behind the restaurant together.\n\nHow am I supposed to be buddy buddy with the chefs when I don't even speak the same language and we don't even work in the same space together? I'm feeling like they're all just taking it really personally because I'm white and it's not like that. \n\nI'm gonna stop eating at the restaurant for awhile and start bringing/buying my own food from now on since me asking for free meals is just so fucking racist and offensive. I'll probably start looking for a new job and until then just kind of lay low. It sucks because I actually like this job but I just hate feeling like im walking on eggshells. I feel like they're just kind of tolerating me and I think 1 or 2 employees are actively trying to get me to quit by fucking with me. \n\nSo what do you say Reddit? Am I the Asshole in this situation? Be honest. I can take it.\n\n**TL;DR I only talk to my coworkers when I want them to make me food and they think I'm racist**",

He proceeded to insult me and call me judgmental when I felt I was being self-preserving by saying 'no'. I am an unmarried woman, well over 30 and storing the vehicle would give access and awareness of me and my property to two men who, by this man's own statements, were 'former thieves' and his 'great' friends. Despite his claim that he would 'protect me', I was not comfy with the whole arrangement.  I felt like he was saying... 'Hey, let me hold your head under water, but I promise to let you up when you need a breath.'  My gut got creepy creepy creepy as he blew up at me in text messages and he called me very mean names and pushed some my hot buttons of which he was aware.

In fact, knowing him as I do, it was his plan from the get-go. He instigates shit like this all the time. \n\nI asked him again about his support on lgbt issues. He kept repeating \"I don't know\", and didn't seem to have a strong opinion about it either way. He said he didn't ask his ex questions as to why she preferred gender neutral pronouns. I told him he is doing a disservice to his friend by not having any reason to be confronting me about it, in front of my friends. He left the house in a huff. \n\nAfter he left, everyone just sort of stood there in shock. They all agreed that he brought it up, and continued to bring it up. One of my friends who was there is a lesbian, and she was annoyed by him. \nTwo of the women there said there was an explanation for this:\n\nBeing very religious and being confused about his own sexuality. His ex is most likely also, if not truly transgender. This fueled it or started it. Because of his religious family, he feels ashamed, and perhaps wants to come out of the closet. He often mentions that the reason he is single is because most women think he is gay. (I think it's more that he just has an obnoxious personality.)\n\nI did feel a little bad hearing this. But not by a lot. They assured me I had nothing to feel bad about, as I would never be able to guess that was what was going on. I somewhat agree with this. I was more upset that he was confronting me about a non-issue. If anyone wants to be called it, she, he, they, them, I don't care either way. But if it's brought up at a get-together, I don't see the problem with asking questions. If he is so sensitive about it, maybe he shouldn't bring it up?\n\nIn my ad for a roommate, I wrote that I would not accept bigots, homophobia or racism, period. I have no idea now whether he is homophobic, or just in the closet. I don't know that being in the closet while still standing by anti-gay religious beliefs is any better. And I really don't like it when people make up strong beliefs and have no actual strong belief behind it. Do you insist on being called a gender neutral pronoun because you saw a post on tumblr about it? Because that's what it looks like. \n\nI still think the guy is an asshole, that won't change. Despite the rest of the witnesses siding with me, am I the asshole in this case? Was he just trying to put on some bizarre show in front of everyone?\n\nTldr; my roommate insists on gender-neutral pronouns to describe his ex, has no belief in it. He's either homophobic or in the closet due to religious upbringing. Started a dramatic hissy fit when I asked questions. ",

    "selftext": "So our street is very busy with lots of crazy drivers and it's only 1 lane each direction around this giant curve. A few days ago, while driving around the curve, all of the sudden we see an old lady in one of those electronic wheelchair things but she's IN THE ONCOMING LANE. AROUND A CURVE. ON A NARROW ROAD. We had to swerve immediately onto oncoming traffic and saw 2 other cars behind us do the same around her. Now a few days later, I see her again on the same curve, in the road. Thankfully for us, this time we were coming the other way, but it seems this is something she does DAILY. Once we pulled in the driveway I went up around the street looking for her on foot and once I saw her she was on the other side of the road which means she crossed somehow (no way it could've been done safely) but I approach her and ask \"why are you on the wrong side of the road?\" \"You realize we almost killed you yesterday?\" \"Why can't you be on the sidewalk or at least on the right side of the road???\" I kept yelling questions because she didn't seem that interested in talking and kept rolling by and I was like \"You're really just gonna keep rolling away?\" \"You can't explain anything?\" And then she said people walk their dogs on the sidewalk and she has to go around the dogshit. And I just ended up saying I don't want to be responsible for killing you! Why would you want to do that to people?\nThe entire time I spoke to her she kept stopping and going, like it was obvious she knew she was in the wrong but then would roll away randomly over and over and just try to ignore me. So I finally said I saw you do that yesterday so I know it happens a lot. And she didn't deny it. And funny thing is I meant to say the day before yesterday so this is actually something she does EVERYDAY. Basically I ended it with saying I called the cops on her yesterday and if she does it again I'll call the police and then she just rolled off like she's trying to get outa there before the po po shows up. I feel bad because I did raise my voice but I actually stayed pretty calm compared to how I'd usually treat the situation cuz she was so old. It was mainly the fact that someone getting into their car across the street sat their with their window down listening so I felt like they thought I was an asshole. But what can you do?",

    "selftext": "So heres the short version. I just moved into a house with a pool with 3 of my other friends. One of them agreed before we moved in to take care of the landscaping and pool duties for a flat fee that would be less than the professional service they offered us. We all payed him up front and were happy with the arrangement when we moved in.\n\nFast forward a week and he hasn't done anything, despite me reminding him multiple times he needs to get the supplies to maintain the pool or its going to start turning green, which will be very expensive to repair. Over the next 3 weeks I remind him nearly every day that he needs to start gathering supplies and doing what we are paying him to do and he gives me the same, \"my dad is getting them\", excuse every time.\n\nOn the 4th week of him not even getting a pool skimmer or doing any pool-work theres a storm and a decent amount of grass ends up in the pool. Having grown up taking care of my own pool I knew we needed to act fast or it would start turning soon. At this point he starts saying it might be too much work and he doesn't want to do it anymore (implying he's actually done anything). \n\nDespite my protest my roommates convince me to let him pay us back and we'll split the duties equally. I immediately drive to the store and buy a skimmer and spend probably 4 hours over the next two days trying to fish out all the pool debris, 2 hours of which were spent swimming around in the disgusting nearly green water trying to get every last bit. Originally responsible roommate spent maybe 30 minutes doing anything, other 2 didnt touch it.\n\nOn the morning of the third day I wake up to find the pool completely green, you cant even see 4 feet. I got quotes from pool professionals and its probably going to cost $200 to fix. The other 3 think its fair to split the $200 4-ways and I am refusing because I dont think i'm 1/4th responsible. Im demanding that the lazy roommate pays at least half, preferably all of it and am getting heavy resistance. Am I going crazy here? Should we really be splitting it and equally? Thanks for reading if you've gotten this far.\n\nTLDR: Roommate gets paid to take care of pool, month later hasn't done shit, quits, pool turns green, wants us to split the cost to repair equally.",

    "selftext": "Apologies this will be long as there are a number of details that are important to the story.\n\nA few days ago my partner and I went to sign a prenup before our wedding and she took the opportunity to write out her will. \n\nBefore I countinue, I should mention that we are both women and have two kids with a gay couple. We don't live with them and are transitioning to shared custody (the kids are still quite young). I'm the non-biological mother of both kids, we've been together since before they were born. Both kids have the same biological father who is on their birth certificate so from a legal sense I'm not their parent. \n\nBack to the will - since we're about to get married, it means that I'll inherit 50% of what she owned if, god forbid, she were ever to pass away before I do. She owns one apartment and we are planning to buy another together. I asked that instead of letting me inherit part of her property to let me only have use of the property (meaning I can live in the properties or rent them out). I specifically asked for this so the kids could inherit both apartments when I pass away without paying inheritance tax (except on my share of the second property). \n\nHere's where it gets complicated. When it comes to any money she may have in her bank account, she said that it should be taken care of by the kids' dad (as he will be the guardian of their estate) and I shouldn't touch it because it should only go to the kids. This has upset me on various levels. First, we all agree the kids will continue to live with me part time (which is what I want) if she were to pass away while they're still minors. Assuming this happens, I'll still need to feed, clothe, and entertain them, not to mention buying school supplies and paying for trips. I earn a good living but considerably less than her so I'll essentially be raising two kids part time on a much smaller income. Secondly, there will be bills to pay, a mortgage to finish paying off and two properties that will need to be maintained (one will be rented out when we buy the second). Finally I'm upset that she'd even think I'd use her money for anything other than the kids or keeping a roof over our heads.\n\nI told her I didn't think this was fair and she said it was too late to do anything about it, and basically brushed me off. She basically feels I should just take care of myself if she passes away.\n\nThis has upset me so much I've been crying for the last two nights and hardly sleeping. She knows I'm upset and why, but acts like nothing is wrong and doesn't seem to want to talk about it. We're getting married soon but honestly this is making me have second thoughts (if it weren't for the kids I might have already been gone). Am I the asshole for being upset about this?",

    "selftext": "So a few days ago, some friends and I are heading out to visit our friend Eric, who lives like 400 miles away from here. My plan was to leave later at night and my friend Mike wanted to ride with me because his car had been having issues. I said that was fine and that I was going to leave at 9pm. Mike says ok, and then finally departure day has arrived. \n\nSo first a bit of background. Mike is almost always late to stuff. Not just a few minutes, but hours. He is literally several hours late to almost every single thing he's invited to. What makes it worse is that he often says he is on his way (he lives 10 minutes away from me) and he still doesn't arrive for another hour or two. He's also sleeps a lot and is a heavy sleeper. He has slept through 8 or 9 hour road trips. This has been going on now for several years. \n\nSo, it's about 8:30 and I call him to ask if he is on his way. There's no answer. I call a couple more times and get the same result. It's now 9 and I'm standing outside my house waiting for him to arrive. I wanted to get out before 9:30 because they close parts of the freeway here and it causes major traffic jams. I also didn't want to leave to late because I didn't want to arrive super late or drive while I was starting to get sleepy. \n\nIt's a few minutes after 9 and still no sign of Mike. No text or calls. I call a couple more times and still no answer. I have also sent him a couple texts at this point and he hasn't even replied to those either. This is when I start to think that he probably fell asleep and just doesn't hear his phone since he's such a heavy sleeper. 9:30 now and still nothing. I'm starting to get pissed at this point. I drove to his house which is only a couple blocks down and see his car outside. I know he's home. I ring the doorbell, bang on the door. nothing! No response or anything. I go to his backyard and I can hear his alarm going off even though his windows are closed. I start calling him again. I even shouted his name a couple times. Still nothing!\n\nI drove back to my house and it's now around 10. I get a call from one of our friends who's already up at Erics house and he starts asking where I'm at and how long it will be until I arrive. I explain the situation and everyone tells me to just leave because we all know how Mike is with time. I explain I didn't want to leave because I'd feel bad and I know he wants to see Eric. It's now been over an hour and I'm starting to get livid. I get in my car to leave and as soon as I start it up I get a call. It's Mike! He didn't even say sorry, just said that he was going to get dressed and head over. I tell him to hurry up. 25 minutes goes by and he's still not there. I call him and he says he's on his way. He shouldn't have taken more than about 10 minutes to get to my place. It's closing in on 11pm and all I can think of is how I should be half way to Erics house by now. I said fuck it and left. I finally leave around 11pm.\n\nAbout midnight, I'm on the road and I get a call. It's Mike! I picked up and he starts going off on me. Telling me he's at my house (it sounded like he had just arrived) and how dare I leave him. He goes on about how he really wanted to go and how he wanted to see Eric and had requested time off from work to go and just starts ranting at me. He tells me I ditched him and that I should've told him I left. I told him my side and I felt like he screwed himself over. I'm rarely ever later and I've never been hours late to anything. I would NOT want someone waiting that long for me, especially when they have such a long drive ahead of them. \n\nSo AITA for \"ditching\" my friend even though he was 3 hours late. \n\n\n",

It's a REALLY LOUD, REALLY OBNOXIOUS alarm. \n\nHe had quite a bit to drink last night and fell asleep on the couch. I covered him up, put a glass of ice water on the coffee table and went to my home office to work for several hours (I'm a freelancer). I went to bed around 4 am. At 6:07, his alarms start going off. They woke me up. I laid in bed for about ten minutes, praying he would wake up and deal with it. He didn't. The only option I have, as his phone is locked, is to snooze the alarm. He has several set in succession because he's a pretty deep sleeper, 10x worse if he's been drinking.\n\nI snoozed it. Three minutes later, phone is screaming again. I go out, pull the covers back and laid the screaming phone on his chest. He doesn't stir. I do everything...and I mean everything short of a BJ to wake him up while his phone is going nuts. Mind you, I've had about two hours of sleep at this point. Finally, I started SCREAMING at him, louder than his phone is making noise. He finally wakes up just enough to shove the phone under his pillow. This doesn't stop it from making noise, it just muffled it. I go back to bed, but I can still hear it, so I go back out and yell at him to deal with his phone. He wakes up and starts screaming back that all he wanted to do on his day off was sleep in. Then, he proceeded to get up, throw things around the kitchen, stomp around, and make as much noise as humanly possible to ensure that I can't go back to sleep at this point. We have two dogs, he also shouted, \"Where is the annoying one? I'm gonna take her out back with the pistol.\" This pissed me off, because I didn't know if he was referencing me or the dogs and I don't take threats like that lightly. Jokes about guns aren't jokes. I came out of the bedroom at that point ready for a knock down drag out fight. He retreated into the guest room. I have never been to that point of mad where your vision goes blurry. I was at that point. I shouted a few choice phrases at him and went back to bed. Got up a few hours later and left the house. He literally slept all day.\n\nThen, I get the silent treatment because in his mind, I woke him up out of a dead sleep for no reason by screaming at him. Literally, screaming was the only thing that was going to wake him up so he would *turn off the fucking alarm*. I've had the silent treatment all day and I'm tired of it, so I tried to talk to him about it. He denies he was being an ass this morning, says it's all my fault and if the alarm bothered me, I should have just put it in another room...this wouldn't have solved anything, because the thing is so loud you can hear it all over the house, even with doors shut.\n\nI bought him his favorite adult beverage of choice as an apology, but was kind of expecting an apology first, since he was the one who got so piss drunk he forgot to turn off his alarms when it was so important he sleep in, he was the one stomping around the house so I couldn't go back to sleep, and basically acting like a toddler.\n\nI got the condescending \"sorry\" and eye roll from him, which basically means, \"there, I said it, now leave me alone\". He also denies the remarks about the pistol. I wasn't hungover and was wide awake, I know what was said.\n\nSo, AITA for not being able to handle his alarm, going into last resort mode to wake him up...by screaming at him, which I agree is a rude awakening, but it was that or a bucket of ice water, literally and I didn't want to clean up that mess at 6:30 am...and then expecting at least some sort of an apology?",

    "selftext": "I walked off a job today. The first time I've done that. I do a lot of gigs as a 20-something- mostly as a Brand Ambassador. Those who don't know what that is, here is a brief synopsis: attractive enough people who stand at booths, inside grocery stores, inside bars, outside bars, etc. promoting a product. I've done a lot of high end, but also low end markets. Today was low- A brand literally geared towards low income folks looking for a cheaper phone service.\n\nThe problem is here is that I am highly educated. Yes you can say the typical millennial. Graduated in 2009 at the height of the worst economy. Have a Masters degree. I have pride, I know this.\nFirst of all, I showed up late to the gig. Granted I live in a place with a lot of traffic, but really I was exhausted from my 7am gig that morning and was running late. 15 mins late.\n\nSecond, I wore the wrong shoes. The manager had told me that morning to wear black converses. I had blue ones.\nThirdly, the job never mentioned I might be sign spinning.\n\nWe were in a bad area, high with prostitution, and general low income- hence the location of our gig. The manager had been running late and was still setting up when I got there. She was stressed as the client was there.\nShe got upset over the blue shoes. I thought the importance was Converse, not the color. My first mistake. Sometimes they provide sponsorship so mentioning the brand I thought made it a priority.\nShe had to send photos to the client. She even removed her shoes so she could photograph me in her black converses.\n\nShe then asked us to both flier and sign spin. I asked to not do the sign spinning as I am interviewing for career jobs, and my former full time job office was across the street. She seem confused by that. For me, sign spinning is degrading. I feel like that already makes me an asshole.\n\nThings went along ok, aside from confusion over where I was to pass out fliers. First I did it on the sidewalk but no one was there and she asked me to move and to not talk to the other brand ambassador.\nThen I tried in the parking lot. She said that wasnt professional and moved me to another side walk.\nThat worked for awhile. That brought folks to our booth. I was making people laugh and enjoy the product, which was the point of the promotion.\n\nThen it stopped, as the manager said she could not take pictures of me in the blue converses rather than black ones. I then must be a sign spinner. I again tried to explain that I am working with the office across the street and didnt want to be seen on the corner of the main drag where a lot of people I know could see me in that position, as well as continued to be cat called by people driving past.\n\nI asked again to not do the sign spinning. She refused each time. I then said I should probably leave if I am not able to submit to her request. She agreed and I left.\n\nI am so conflicted as to whether it was worth it. I am missing out on a high paying gig for a few weeks and will have nothing to show for my pride. Yes, I won't have to be embarrassed/ humiliated/ be shown in an awkward position to coworkers or future clients......but am I the asshole?",

But she pushed me to my wits end.\n\nI don't compare this to pregnancy simply because I don't know pregnancy, but I've dealt with Hemorrhoids for the better part of my adult life. The past year I've been in near constant pain, broken only by the occasional thrombosis leading to a week of laying in bed trying not to laugh, sneeze, cough, yell, breath... Essentially I know pain. And with hemorrhoids you're not allowed to take any real pain meds, like Vicodin, because constipation and makes everything a ton worse.  \n\n\nOk, so my friends wife gave birth about 2 months ago. She had her labor induced and it eventually had to go into a C-Section. Since then she's had the monopoly on pain, if you say \"Oh, I got a paper cut!\" She replies with \"Well try having a baby!\", if you stub your toe and yell she replies with \"Well try having a baby!\", get a headache and she replies \"Well try having a baby!\". You picking up on the pattern here? Essentially anytime anyone exclaimed about any pain at all regardless of how trivial or extreme she sticks her trade marked \"Well try having a baby!\". Meanwhile she's downing Vicodin pills by fist full. Finishing the ones her doctor gave her and then getting her husband to get her more from illegal sources.

We're watching a movie where a character is impaled with an Antenna and is forced to operate on himself to remove a left over bit. The actor masterfully depicts the massive level of pain that you'd be in self operating on your own abdomen  and then having to staple yourself back together. At this point she blurts out \"OH COME ON! TRY HAVING A BABY!\" at which point I snap. I yell \"For God Sake you do not have the monopoly on pain! Because you had to go through what you went through, it does not mean that the rest of us are not entitled to scream when we're fucking impaled!\" she then tried to say \"You don't know what it's like!\" to which I replied \"Yes! You're right, I don't know what it's like to go through immense pain while downing Vicodin after Vicodin, finishing the ones that your doctor gave you plus the ones illegally acquired by your husband! I guess I'm just naive!\"\n\nI almost immediately felt bad but I try really hard not to talk about my ordeal or burden people with it. Sitting there just trying to enjoy the movie, still unable to sit right from the pain of the past week's flair up, I just lost it.

He knows I'm disabled and I rely on a car for transport because I can't stand or walk more than 50m. He thinks I should study my masters and my TQFE (Lecturer qualification) and \"Just stay at home and teach!!\"\nHe also knows I'm using this job to allow me to make contacts in this big city so I can move there. I don't want to be a piano teacher full time, I want to start a function band, etc, and I cannot do it where I'm from.... It'd be like comparing New Orleans to... a small town of 30,000, where 59% of the residents are over 70....\n\nI feel like he's deliberately controlling me so I don't leave the house and I stick to the career he wants me to do.

At school she lives in a conjoined single which means there are two separate rooms and a shared bathroom. I have only stayed one weekend there since school started. Her roommate who lives in the other room told her I \"probably shouldn't come this weekend\" because her boyfriend is coming up and there might be too many people sharing the bathroom. I personally think that is ridiculous because 4 people sharing one bathroom is not a big deal considering I'll be taking one shower and maybe have to go to the bathroom once or twice. My girlfriend graduates in the winter and did not have any friends going into this year since she transferred but because of her roommate, she made friends with her and her friends. She doesn't want to make her mad and jeopardize her friendship but my counter argument is it isn't worth being friends with someone who would say that in the first place. Usually she stays at my house but because of family plans my parents don't want her coming this one weekend (this is the only time they have ever had a problem). I haven't yelled or name called at her but I am upset with her and it is clear. Am I the asshole? \n\nEdit: It is clear that I am the asshole and I realize this now. I have spoken to her and told her that I understand and I don't want to jeopardize her friendships so I can stay there one weekend. I guess more football watching for me :)",

    "selftext": "Every single time I'm with my girlfriend walking around the city and I hear music playing my heart skips a beat. Often, she'll just pass on through it, but recently (in the past couple of months) sometimes she'll notice a place (restaurant, club, or some other place playing music) and beg me to come with her to get closer to the music. Because she'd throw a fit if I said \"no, let's continue on with what we were planning on doing/where we were planning on going\", I oblige and we go there. She then starts dancing to the music right outside of the establishment, or if there are already people dancing she watches them. \n\nThis in and of itself doesn't cause any issues with me. Sure, she can do what she likes, I'm not relationship Hitler I'm not going to tell her to not dance outside of a place or not to watch people dancing. But I do have a few issues because these things happen every single time.\n\n* It'll take forever. This was hard to write and I'm sure it sounds bad. But she just keeps dancing/watching them dance. I'm not talking 10 or 20 minutes (that's rare) either, much more than that. I'm sorry, me and my girlfriend planned other things and we're missing them because she heard a catchy tune and dragged me along to watch her dance. Sure, I can enjoy that she's enjoying something. But that only goes so far until the crushing zero stimulation boredom creeps in on me.\n\n* She berates me for looking bored. You're dragging me to watch you/others do something that I have zero interest in, of course I'm going to look bored because I AM bored. She'll get mad if I pull out my phone.\n\n* She does this at the worst possible times. I'm in pain and haven't slept in 30+ hours? It doesn't matter to her because she heard a catchy tune and decided to dance to it for literally 40 minutes. Or we'll be going to a dinner (and as such I haven't eaten all day specifically so I can eat with her for dinner), and she stops on the way to watch street performers dance for a half an hour. I wouldn't have a problem with her if she actually invited me to it and it's what we set out to do. I don't enjoy that kind of stuff but maybe I can go in and get a drink while she does her thing.\n\n* Everytime I put my foot down or otherwise insist that we leave/go do what we planned to do she tells me that I ruin all her fun and sulks. Despite how she could've went alone (or let me go while she danced), went with someone else, or actually invited me to go instead of dragging me there against my will when we were planning on doing something we both enjoyed.\n\nNaturally I don't actually tell her \"It's so boring I'd rather bang my head violently against the wall\", I usually make an excuse to try to persuade her not to interrupt our plans in lieu of dancing outside a building for 3/4ths of an hour, something like \"hey I REALLY want to do [thing we actually planned for] let's get going\" or something like that. It usually doesn't work but still I try.\n\nWhen I actually confront her about this (and it happens so often, I confront her maybe 1 every 4-5 times) she responds with essentially \"You always ruin my fun. It has to interrupt plans because I can't tell when the songs will be catchy. You don't need to seem so bored during it either\".\n\nFrom my standpoint her actions show little regard for me, show a lack of social skills, and are generally just a result of being spoiled. But when I told this to other people, I was told I should just 'suck it up' and that I'm an asshole for 'not being able to just wait around with a smile for 40 minutes while she dances'.",

We have shared this garden for probably 2.5 years and in that time I have (not figuratively, literally) always trimmed the hedge, disposed of the cuttings, blah, blah, blah... \n(I bet you've guessed where I'm pettily heading...)\n\nSo I had a really busy month at work, then went on a week long holiday, and DID NOT trim the hedge at all. So by this point it was as unkempt as a bag ladies bush. It really did look shit.\nSo my neighbour hires someone to trim the hedge, or maybe did it themselves, but I doubt it. But not the whole hedge, just the half that fronts their house. \n\nSo this has really wound me up, far more than it should have for a supposedly well balanced individual. To the point where I have decided to no longer do their half of the hedge when I trim in future, despite this being likely to just piss me off as I'll still see the messy hedge.\nSo a two stage asshole question;\n1) Am I an asshole for assuming they would reciprocate the work I had done if they ever did trim the hedge? (noting I didn't leave it to see if they would, it was just because I was busy/away)\n2) Am I an asshole (preemptively) for deciding to only cut to the boundary that they went to next time I trim the hedge? \n\nTldr; petty dude (also quite drunk) mithering about pointless bullshit, don't bother if you didn't read it the first time round...\n\n\nEDIT\nWell, it appears I'm not overwhelmingly an asshole (in this instance), but am probably petty, quick to judge and possibly unreasonable. Thank you internet!\n\nIf anyone is interested I will probably not do their side for a while and then just start again.

    "selftext": "This happened awhile ago, but it still eats at me. So some second opinions would be nice.\n\nI met this girl online. We started talking and quickly become friends, eventually evolving into best friends. During the friendship, I never got the opportunity to meet her, all our contact was over the phone/skype/social media/etc. Also during our friendship, a male friend and I were starting to form a relationship. It was exciting, and I would talk to her about it. She always sounded excited for me, too. And she was more than willing to listen to me when boyfriend and I were having problems. She was, in that sense, a great friend.\n\nOne day she told me that she had developed romantic feelings for me. She told me she loved me, and was upset that we couldn't be together. I felt bad, I really did. I've been in her shoes with other people and it always sucks. I told her I would stop talking about my boyfriend if it made her uncomfortable. I also made sure to tell her that this wouldn't change how I saw her or our friendship, and that I still considered her my closest friend. All was well for a bit after that.\n\nBut then she'd start bringing up her feelings every now and then. Just saying \"I love you\" at random times (times that would be totally appropriate if we were dating, but inappropriate that we weren't), telling me how much she cared about me and going on and on about it. And when she was having a bad day, would say she wished we could kiss and cuddle.\n\nI never once got frustrated with her because she had feelings for me, I got frustrated with her because she wouldn't let it go. It was especially inappropriate because I had a boyfriend that she knew I was very serious about. I offered more than once to give her space if she needed, and she always refused.\n\nSo one day I told her that I was the one that needed space, that she was effecting my relationship (he knew about her and what was going on). She was very upset, but said she understood. I told her I still wanted to talk and be friends, but not talk every single day like we were. But at that point, she pretty much stopped talking to me all together. I didn't push the issue. She was doing what she needed to do for her own sake (I hope).\n\nFor a couple months after that, I'd get an occasional message from her. Some were just \"How are you?\". I'd respond, but the conversations would end quick on her terms. Others were \"I miss you\". One time she sent me a picture of her arm where she had cut herself. I knew she would occasionally do that (and I never once shunned her for it, being someone who self harmed myself). But this time, she deliberately carved my initials. It was so extreme. I didn't know if she was trying to manipulate me, or if she just wasn't thinking clearly. Maybe both?\n\nMany many months later after not talking to each other at all (and no longer friends on any social media), I texted her. She was on my mind and I wanted to see how she was doing. We chatted briefly, and caught me up to speed on her life. It was nice. Then she asked me why I had contacted her. I was honest, saying I was thinking about her and missed her. She didn't respond after that. We haven't spoken since.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I know it's in the past, and I should move on. But things ended so badly, and it bugs me probably more than it should. She was one of the closest friends I had ever had.\n\nTL;DR I dropped an old friend after she continued to remind me of her feelings for her that I did not return.",

In this case, I decided to ask her if she had lost weight since some of the pictures were taken. She said that the pictures were taken over the years and that the glasses may have an effect on her appearance (she was wearing glasses in all her overweight pictures). I asked her if her main picture was her most recent one (because she was very cute in it). She asked me why that mattered. I explained how I've been deceived before, and her response was that it shouldn't matter how made up she is in her pictures and that I'm just projecting insecurities.

I said \"ew\", but they thought I meant the show and not the couple. They said they were surprised I didn't like the show because it was so much like another show I love. Our conversation got a little tense over that because I insisted that they were nothing alike.\n\nWhile that was going on, I looked up the ages of the characters they mentioned, because I was pretty sure one was a young teen and the other was in his 30s. The idea of my friend being into something like that made me very uncomfortable, but I decided I should ignore it. My roommate saw and questioned me about the situation, then sent a message to my friend from their own Skype. (It was nothing more than a \"hi!\", but I asked them not to start shit.)\n\nSo my friend got suspicious and asked why my roommate messaged them, and I explained that she saw me looking up the ages of the characters. My friend then explained that there were no official ages of the characters, only speculations. They did admit though that there is likely a decent age gap, and that the wiki pages do say that one is an adult and the other a minor. They then assured me that they like the pairing only in the context of both being consenting adults.\n\nI said \"That's a relief\" but it really upset them and they accused me of being a bad friend for jumping to conclusions and assuming they would be into a pedophilia relationship. I said I was just concerned and surprised, not trying to judge, and explained that \"people are full of surprises\" especially with internet friends and how anyone could be into weird shit. They tried to drop it but then brought it up again by mentioning that I didn't seem happy with them.\n\nI said I didn't like being called a bad friend and they said they didn't like being told they could possibly be into pedophilia. I insisted that I didn't even bring it up, they asked me a question that I answered honestly. They kept pulling up quotes and I kept defending myself. In the end they said \"given my insecurities about being called an abuser and emotional manipulator, and the fact that I've worked with children, I think it's valid that I'm upset.\"\n\n**Edit:** The interaction with my roommate went like this:\n\n\"Why are you looking up Character A and B's ages?\"  \n\"Skype Friend mentioned they were reading a fanfiction about them.\"  \nRoommate proceeds to get judgmental all on their own because they watch the show and think the pairing is wrong to be into.  \nNever at any point did the word \"pedophilia\" come from me while I was talking to either of them.",

I had one really busy shift that I had to work with another person and a really slow shift that saw me doing very little besides cleaning and stocking, generally picking up the slack of the other people who just didn't do any cleaning, or actual work.\n\n\n\n   I made clear to everyone in charge that I'd love at least one more shift, unfortunately none were available I was told. Fast forward to a week ago, someone is let go and I was called to cover the shifts, which I'm fine with, and am happy thinking finally I can get close to full time, it's been a struggle! Instead I find out they hired this new guy who is friends with the manager, (really he is the owners nephew and has never worked in this industry before) and they want to be fair with the hours so we get the same # of days, but instead of having set days they are rotating so now everyone that comes in when I normally would be there and all of the people that I've told I work this and this day and time show up and someone else gets to benefit. I'm told this is all fair and etc. But I can't help being passed off and thinking it's exactly the opposite, am I the asshole for being mad. \n\n\n\n Also the whole rotating shifts every week just went out the window as the schedule for this upcoming week is same as last.

He's 16, and I love him, but we oftentimes have it out verbally. \n\nWhat usually ends up happening is that we'll go a week or two getting along, and then he does something or gets an attitude about something that absolutely drives me mad. Then, inevitably; we end up fighting about it.\n\nHalf the time I feel that I'm not in the wrong. What usually incites these arguments is the fact that I tell him what to do, even when my parents end up saying the same thing I do in the long run. No matter what it is, if it comes out of my mouth he's going to have an attitude about it.\n\nWithin the past 2 days, we recently had to mow. I usually do a good bulk of the mowing, and he gets the trim. That's how it's been for a long time and it works well with both of our schedules. So I let him know that the mowing needs done (Yesterday) and he goes out to do it. Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.\n\nFlash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed. And I didn't want them to get mad on my mother's birthday, and I didn't want to clean his mess up for him because he needs to learn to do it on his own.\n\nI go out to get a snack as he's cleaning, and I told him how we get along for a week or so and he becomes an insufferable douche. Then he tells me that he can't wait until I move out, even though it probably won't happen and he called me a fat ass with a superiority complex. All because I told him to clean up his mess, and mow his part of the lawn (Which hasn't even been done yet.)\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you so far for the feedback! I'll definitely try and tone down how much I tell him what to do.\nI would like to mention/ask a few things however. I'm not looking to change minds, I genuinely want help.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you ask him kindly to do something or tell him. A majority of the time he will get huffy about it. Even with my parents.\n\nThe only one he doesn't seem to have a problem listening to is our oldest brother (21). And they never fight whenever he tells him to do something, and he even agrees that I'm usually right on most matters.\n\nIs there any way for me to ensure that he'll start cleaning up after himself without sounding bossy? Or for my parents to do so? I don't want them to have to clean up after him, nor do I think I should have to either.\n\nOnce again, thank you for the responses! I'll keep them in mind next time a think a confrontation might happen. I'll definitely try to ask him instead of tell him more often, and I won't pester him about his chores as much. Thank you! ",

    "selftext": "A group of my friends are all traveling together for work. Friend A (will be called Anna) and I share a room. She hasn't spoken much to me, and in the last about month or so has been very aloof and conspicuously ignored me. Whatever.\n\nA group of my friends and some new acquaintances were playing a drinking game. Anna was in our shared room, on the phone. I went through our room briefly to get my bottle-opener, heard her laughing and saying cutesy stuff. I got back to the group and about 5 min later, Friend B (will be called Bonnie) asked where Anna was.\n\nME: \"She's in our room on the phone, I think with [Anna's bf].\"\n\nI said this because 1) she was in our room, 2) she was on the phone, 3) it sounded like it was with her bf and so this wasn't a vast leap of logic, and 4) the one time I accidentally interrupted a phone call by speaking to her before I could see her as I entered a room she got super mad about it and I figured she'd get mad about anyone interrupting her phone call. I didn't lay out this reasoning, only said what's in quotations above.\n\nWe continued our game. 10 min later, Bonnie leaves the room where the games were going on. Two min after that, I leave the game room and go into Anna's and my shared room to use the ensuite bathroom. In the bedroom, Anna and Bonnie are having a hushed conversation that abruptly ends as I pass through.\n\nWhen I come out, Bonnie is gone. I say to Anna:\n\nME: \"Do you want to join..\"\n\nThe unspoken completion of the sentence being \"...us in the other room? The French (a group of French people cohabiting with us) are teaching us a new game.\"\n\nANNA (interrupting): \"Nuh-uh, don't you talk to me. I'm mad at you.\"\n\nME: \"Ok, some other time, then.\"\n\nI reply, and leave. It's evident she's mad at me and was before I spoke, but I'd assumed it was because she hadn't been invited to join yet as well as for whatever mystery reasons have been making her mad this whole time. So, I'd thought I could remedy it by inviting her and trying to talk. Apparently not.\n\nShe remains silent for over a day.\n\nBear in mind, she's been acting stand-offish and aloof for about a month now. I've wracked my brain for everything I might be doing \"wrong\". I usually wake up before her, so I use silent alarms and have even delayed my usual wake-up time closer to her usual. I set out clothes the day before because my wardrobe door is squeaky and might wake her in the mornings. I exchange pleasantries as we pass in the kitchen in the morning and greet her when she gets home in the evening. On nights we eat out as a group, I usually take her side in choosing. When we cook at home, I offer her some of what I've made. There's not a lot of conversation, but that's (in my view) largely because her side of the morning and evening pleasantries tend to be one-word answers, which are not very easy for me to read for openings to conversation, and she does not make similar effort. I try to think of stupid thinks I may have done--leaving hair in the shower drain or a mug on the table. One time I did accidentally lock her out of the room when I thought she'd left the house before me (I was running nearly 3hrs behind schedule due to oversleep from sickness the night before, and hadn't seen her since waking. We must've just missed passing each other more than once that morning), but we'd already reconciled that...ish. She used the silent treatment then, too, and her acceptance of my apology didn't seem sincere then, either. Beyond keeping different schedules and the one incident which she'd unconvincingly insisted was reconciled, I genuinely couldn't think of something I'd done to offend.\n\nI finally bring it up with her, forcing the issue when we're in the living room of our accommodation, just us two. Maybe it was a little heavy-handed since she said she didn't want to talk, but any attempts to talk in the privacy of our room were met with a loudly dismissive \"Mm-mnh\" and the use of a neutral space we could both be equally expected to leave if the disagreement escalated overmuch seemed apt. Plus, my only thoughts on the matter were what I voiced to try to get the dialogue going:\n\nME (trying to be inviting): \"You've been really angry with me lately, and we need to talk about what's up.\"\n\nANNA: \"Nope, I'm still mad at you and won't talk to you.\"\n\nME: \"About what? I know you're mad, you've been acting annoyed with me for a while, but I don't know why. What is it I did?\"\n\nANNA: \"You really don't know?\"\n\nME: \"No. And I'm sorry that I've offended you, but I don't see what I did.\"\n\nANNA: \"You really don't? Because I think that you do, and you're just playing.\"\n\nME: \"I genuinely don't know what I did that insulted you this badly. Can you just tell me? I'm not going to know unless you can tell me.\"\n\nANNA: \"It's just, I thought you were a different person. But I've got to know you, living with you, and I guess you're not.\"\n\nME (open body language, palms-up-at-waist-level gesture): \"I'm still at a loss.\"\n\nANNA (scoffing laugh): \"You really don't know? Do you just not pick up on social cues?\"\n\nActually, that *is* something I struggle with, which is why this text presents as such an in-depth analysis of a single event. Massive social anxiety coupled with slight ASD mean that social cues are decidedly not my forte and consume a huge amount of my thought process when trying to interact with others. I weigh pretty much every action and word before I proceed for that very reason. But, I'm not about to lay my shit out for her, she's not exactly in the mood to be sympathetic. All I can really say is:\n\nME: \"What?\"\n\nANNA: \"The other day, what did you say about me?\"\n\nOk, now I'm totally lost. Part of weighing my words includes pretty much never talking about other people outside of blatant facts and sound assumptions, and never in a negative context. Her tone indicates it was something really, *really* bad. I'll have to rehash everything I've said about her for the last month or so. It'd help if she'd narrow things down, so I ask:\n\nME: \"When?\"\n\nANNA: \"When you were all drinking.\"\n\nI hesitate, trying to remember. I'd never have said something negative or harsh, but I try to think if maybe I did--my patience with her broad-spectrum negativity *has* been wearing thin, but it's no more than I've borne in the past. No way I slipped and said something petty or mean. I remember the remark about her being on the phone--a very neutral thing to say, and honestly the only thing I said in reference to her the whole night. I don't see why it would be the reason, but I offer that.\n\nME: \"Someone asked where you were, and I said you were on the phone.\"\n\nANNA (wheedling): \"Uh-huh, and that's all?\"\n\nME (hesitant): \"I mean, I did say 'I guess she's on the phone with [Anna's bf]'.\"\n\nANNA (imperious): \"That's right, and it's none of your business who I talk to. It's none of THEIR business who I talk to, and you go saying I'm on the phone with [bf's name]. Like they even know who [bf] is!\"\n\nUm, Bonnie, who I was directly addressing, does. But, ok, cool.\n\nME (apologetic): \"Alright, I didn't realize that would offend you. I figured you wouldn't want to be interrupted on the phone, so I said you were on the phone.\"\n\nIs that really what this was about? Can't be. She's been angry way longer.\n\nANNA (Disbelieving): \"Really.\"\n\nME (incredulous): \"Yeah. The one time I accidentally interrupted you on the phone, you got super mad and waved a finger in my face.\"\n\nMaybe that was a little accusatory, but it was also factual.\n\nANNA: \"Uh, yeah. I was on the phone.\"\n\nME (neutral once more): \"I hadn't known at the time.\"\n\nANNA (demanding): \"When was this?\"\n\nReally? We're getting off topic, I'm just here to apologize for what I'm now discovering was an offensive action. I'm not gonna rehash an offense she made against me three weeks prior, it'll just sound petty. I only referenced in support of my reasoning in having said she was on the phone.\n\nME: \"Like the first week here or so. But look, I see my mistake. I won't say anything next time.\"\n\nI'm not an argumentative person--if I'm told to stop, I'll stop. If I'm not told, and there's no otherwise cues that indicate I should stop, I probably won't. Now I know speaking about her is something that bothers her, and has no defined limit or boundary, so just to be safe I now know to never again speak about her in any context without her immediately present...save here, anonymously.\n\nANNA: \"You know I'm a private person, but you constantly do things that irk me. Speculating about things. I'm done talking, before I start yelling.\"\n\nYou were already yelling, but okay. She left at this point.\n\nAnd, yeah, I know she doesn't have FB and immediately after the one time I used her name in a post was when she told me she hates the site, and I promptly offered to take the post down (which she declined). Also, it's not like I was going into gory detail when I answered when someone asked where she was. Maybe they didn't need me to speculate on who she was on the phone with or even need the phone detail, but I tend to abide by the rule of \"do unto others\" and would honestly not be even remotely insulted if anyone had guessed who I was on the phone with (correctly or incorrectly), let alone go radio-silence for a full day and then tear the apologetic party's head off. I've never encountered someone who would give a reaction like that. Was it about the delayed invitation to the games, too? She ended up just ignoring us and staying away from the group all night, anyway.\n\nAm I the asshole for having spoken about her being on the phone (potentially with bf)?\n\nOr for posting to FB, finding out she dislikes FB, offering to remove the post, being told not to, and then not doing so?\n\nOr for the mystery offense hiding behind Door Number 3?\n\nEDITed for dialogue clarity.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI see Anna on the phone. I'm asked by Bonnie where Anna was, said to Bonnie in front of others that Anna was talking to bf on phone. Later, find out Anna was offended by my having said anything/assumed something, but only after silent treatment and having to drag it out of her. Truth of my assumption (bf on phone) still unknown. Promised not to do similar again, and have not. She's still mad. No idea why.\n\nPlus bonus related interactions for further context.",

Janet's speech was slurred and she had this look in her eyes that very/black-out drunk people get, and she didn't seem understand personal space, I had to keep stepping back.\n\nOutside the club with my friends as we kind of lingering and saying goodbye to each other I see the Janet being led by a guy (Lets call him Ben (which I don't know)) . So I ask Ben quietly 'do you think that maybe Janet is a little too drunk? If you see what I mean'\n\nThe Ben was a little taken aback and got a little defensive. Ben said that he hadn't planed anything with Janet and that he just wanted to go home and sleep. We chatted a little and I wished him a good night.\n\nI didn't think about this interaction until a few days later when I was talking in Skype with a friend (who wasn't there that night). I was telling him about my night, and this story came up. My friend told me that he thought I was a complete prick for doing that to Ben and a \"sjw\".\n\nWhich made me think. I might have come across very rude in Ben's eyes. My intentions were genuine, but then again maybe it was wrong of my to try and \"white-knight\" Janet, and that she was an adult and could make her own decisions. I mean I wasn't Janet's friend or anything, I didn't know her.\n\nWhat are you guys think? Should I react differently if a situation like this occurs again?

The other housemates have been making a lot of comments on me using it. \n\nThe person who lives downstairs doesn't like the dryer noise.

It rains a lot so leaving things outside all day is risky, often they end up more wet than they started.

I've tried to discuss this with my parents so I'm not just walking out the door one day, but they refuse to listen. They like to pretend it's not happening. I'm the oldest sibling, so I understand that cutting the cord must be hard. But it's bound to happen eventually.\n\nI had posted on Facebook that I was at a bar near where I'd be moving to. A friend of mine commented saying I was minutes away from her house. I responded saying I'll be moving down there in a few months and we can hangout and whatnot. This was posted last night.\n\nThis morning I wake up to a text from my mom saying that before I go posting things like that on Facebook I should talk to her and dad first. I responded saying that I've tried and they won't listen. I know when I get home later today they'll want to have a discussion about how I need to watch what I post online and blah blah blah (I'm 21 for god's sake. I make an innocent joke about Ted Cruz awhile ago and my mom gave me a long chat about that).\n\nAm I the asshole here?

I've tried to talk about it to him around 5 times with the first couple of times he said things like I understand and ok but the last time he said \"I don't see why this is such a big deal\". He has also said things like his girlfriend is having roommate troubles so I tried to be understanding and let her sleep over for the rest of the week but after that week it didn't stop. I feel like i'm paying a lot of money for a college dorm and I paid for a double not a triple and with his girlfriend sleeping over i'm getting all of the negative sides of a triple with none of the benefits of having one.

Am I an asshole?**\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.\n\nWhen I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big \"gift\", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. \n\nSo it's getting to that time again and I figured my \"gift\" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors.

I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. \n\nI even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.\n\nInitially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty.

He always tries to piss me off or mess with me by slamming doors when I'm around (he doesn't slam them when I'm not near by), trying to get me in trouble with my parents, usually by making stuff up. He's told them that I go around coughing in the kitchen, that I'm taking stuff from their office, it's all pretty petty. He even lies to me. He never cleans up after himself and when I confront him about it he just lies and says he didn't make the mess. He has taken my clothes out of the dryer mid cycle and told me  that I deserve it or that he didn't do it. He loves to make little comments under his breath about my girlfriend and I when we're around. He even got really angry that we went to my Moms birthday dinner so much that he started cursing in the restaurant and threw money at my dad when he left. \n\nMore recently he stole some shirts and camping stuff I had. I know it was him because it disappeared when he was the only one in the house. And I also noticed he was checking out a shirt I was wearing right before it disappeared. Just a few weeks ago my girlfriend and I were at my parents house putting up curtain rods for them. My brother started throwing a fit as soon as he saw us. He turned on the TV which he wasn't watching at all nor could he even see it since we were in the way. He had the volume turned up super high, louder than he normally has it. He then went to my dad and told him, \"Tell them to fuck off! I'm watching TV!!\" and started slamming doors. This is just one example of his many outbursts that he has. He's 26 and has always had some serious anger issues. \n\nI also think he's trying to become a cop so he can \"run into\" some old friends of his that he no longer gets along with. He's always been big on revenge. Even my dad shares this opinion. Anywho, the police department he's applying for has sent me a letter asking me to fill out a form about his personal behavior and attitude. I was pretty honest on it and  told them about his anger issues. My dad had spoken to me prior to me getting the letter.

He has no excuse for not texting right when he found out, which would have been around 5:30 pm that night.  Him waiting until 11 pm essentially squandered any solution that could happen, and he refuses to accept that because \"I didn't accidentally take the vest.\"  And because of all this he had to pay for a new badge, and he is withholding money he owes me since the internet bill is under my name.\n\nAm I the asshole?  I apologized that I took his badge by accident, but I believe he really put me into a position where I couldn't do much, and he refused to do anything that would require him to put some effort into fixing this.\n\nEdit:  I'm going to pay for his badge because I did take the badge.  I still don't feel I'm the asshole though.   ",

I want to turn left into a side-street.\n\nA large amount of opposing traffic is coming through as I'm sitting at the red. The red soon changes to a protected left arrow, so I begin to take my turn. There's a car that's approaching in the oncoming traffic lane with its hazard lights on. I thought that was a little weird but I kept taking my turn anyway. Then to my surprise, the car blew the red light and continued into the intersection. I basically had to lean on my horn, which caused the guy to stop.\n\nNow, this guy starts gesturing at me and I notice the \"funeral\" flag hanging from his rear view mirror. I start gesturing back because, guess what, my state (unlike some states) does not give the right of way to funeral processions. If you a blow a red light in a funeral procession you are just as guilty as if you blew it any other time. I proceeded through the intersection and on to my destination.\n\nI explained this to my friend, who called me an asshole. Her argument was that they were mourners and should get a pass. It doesn't happen often and so I should have just extended that courtesy.\n\nMy argument was that hey, I was just obeying the traffic laws which we have for a good reason. Emergency vehicles can run red lights because they have loud sirens and lights, so you see it coming. Putting on your hazard lights having a little sign that says \"funeral\" (which I didn't notice until much later in the incident) is no substitute. I'm sorry that someone died but that's no excuse to blow a red light and endanger other people. You're driving a two-ton death machine, you need to follow the rules of the road.\n\nSo am I an asshole for taking that left turn or what?",

Food left out on the tables, dishes in the sink and cups everywhere, it was a mess. My parents left for a little trip on Sunday and came back on Tuesday. During the time they were gone I was either in school most of the day or I was studying for exams. I washed the dishes and cleared the sink, the dishwasher and basically took care of all that stuff. I couldn't do much about the trash and food since the trash cans were completely full and I also hadn't been asked to do anything about it. I kind of thought they would take care of it when they came back. My brother who also lives here didn't contribute anything to helping out. I thought since I was the one taking care of the dogs and making sure the backyard was cleaned up(which is actually his chore) that I wouldn't have to clean any more of the kitchen.\n\nWhen my parents came home on Tuesday the first thing my dad says is, \"Didn't you do anything while we were gone??\" I was already pissed about this since I he's always complaining about people being in a bad mood when they walk in the house. Now he and my mom are giving me shit for not cleaning the entire kitchen. When I argued my points they just stormed off. About 2 hours later my mom comes into my room and she's pretty drunk and starts guilt tripping me about not cleaning the kitchen. After a bunch of yelling I started cleaning everything up, put the folding tables away, brought in furniture that was outside, brought stuff out that was inside and made it look like new again. \n\nI was just mad because I had already taken care of the dishes. My brother who was also at the party didn't help out with anything. But mostly because my parents threw a big party that they were so excited about and then went on vacation the next day and expected me to clean it all up. \n\nEver since I've been getting crap from them about not doing anything around the house and how I need to start contributing more and doing stuff without being told or asked.

My husband and I live in a major city and our parents both live an hour and a half away in the suburbs. \n\n\nShortly after I got home from the hospital with my daughter, my husband's family came in to visit. They haven't visited us since. My family has come a total of four times since May. Once because I bought them tickets to an event for their anniversary, the second time because it was my birthday, and the other times were \"just because\" visits. \n\n\nWhen I was on maternity leave, we visited my parents and my husband's parents a lot. Probably a total of 2-3 times a month, even though our daughter hates (HATES) the car. \n\n\nI started work a month ago. I see my daughter in the morning and at night for a few hours and obviously on weekends. Weekends are so special to me now and so we haven't visited our families in a month or so. The bottom line is, I really don't want to spend my weekend driving 3 hours round trip to visit my family. My daughter still hates the car, she cries almost the whole time, and she doesn't sleep well at either house.

They're two adults who can sit in a car for 3 hours without crying, so I think they need to make more of an effort to visit if they want to get to know her. \n\n\nSo I guess the question is, am I being too harsh?

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've been having a recent issue with my sibling. I apologize in advance for the wall of text. I'm a student who rents out a portion of my parents house. It's a pretty sweet deal, as I hand over only 25% of my income to them and have much better accommodations than typically available to a broke student and they can pay their bills. The house used to be a pseudo bed and breakfast, so we have plenty of space. We do share common areas, which is fine as we and our pets get along (my parent's dog and my cat).\n\n\nUnfortunately, my sister went through a recent break-up and had to drop off her dog at the house for a couple of months until she found dog-friendly lodgings of her own. She moved in with a friend of hers. I was fine with this as her dog is very sweet around people and, while he had a history of being rough with cats, had lived with one for two years without a problem. Just in case, I kept an eye on them and they got along very wonderfully for the first few weeks he was here. My mom was a bit less pleased, as it would be weeks before my sister could take back her dog.\nBut, in these last two weeks he began to get aggressive with her. He bit her once on the head when she was sleeping on my lap and he was sitting next to me on the sofa. I told my sister about this and she said that her dog had a jealous streak and that I should be more careful. From then on, I and my parents kept the other animals from jumping on the couch if he was already up there and visa versa.\n\n\nHe then started to suddenly chase her. If he got close to her during these chases he would growl and snap at her. I again talked to my sister about it. She said that she had no other place to put him, but that he rough housed with my parent's late cat and her own and neither were ever hurt. My parent's agreed that it was likely harmless and he was probably just startled to have a cat saddle up into his line of sight. I thought they weren't taking this seriously and so I told them then that if he did actually kill my cat because they neglected to prevent the dog from attacking her that I report both him and them to animal control. The law in my state and municipality states that a dog that kills another domestic animal is at risk of being euthanized or muzzled whenever outdoors, which would break my sister's heart. I told them that it wasn't a fair situation for either the dog or the cat and that we needed to be very careful. My mother said that it was just a cat and that I was cruel for even suggesting risking a dog's life or inconveniencing my sister for one. Once we both cooled down we agreed that this was just a temporary situation and that we would all keep a closer eye on them.\n\n\nBut, keeping an eye on them simply hasn't worked. In this last week he has actually bit her again at least twice and even broke the skin, so he is not just roughly playing with her. My parent's dog also started snapping at her. This last time, my sister's dog had been sleeping on the couch and must have had a nightmare. He sprung up and lunged at my cat who was sleeping in front of the television. My parent's dog ran up and pinned her down. I thought I was about to see her die and was too far away to do anything about it when she got a lucky swipe in. She ran and hid. When I found her she was wet with dog saliva and sore, but otherwise well. I know the dogs have a strong prey drive and a pack mentality, so I don't blame either of them for what happened. I told my sister about this, but she shrugged it off.\n\n\nThese events all occurred when I was around and I have no doubt that more had happened when I wasn't around to witness them. My parents did not take their late cat to the vet unless I paid for its treatment. My sister isn't swimming in cash and wouldn't be able to reimburse me even if she wished to, which she likely wouldn't. This combined with their recent inaction meant that I didn't feel like I could trust any of them alone with with the pair. I wasn't precisely keen to risk my cat's health, my sister's dog's well-being, and a potential civil case with my sister to get vet bills covered on the hope that her dog wouldn't escalate any further.\n\n\nSo I kept my cat in my bedroom, which was the only place I could absolutely guarantee that my sister's dog could not enter. I spent all my spare cash on making it as much of a cat paradise as a I could on short notice. I told my mother that this incident was the final straw and that my cat would stay in the room until my sister's dog was gone. It was only supposed to stay for another two weeks to one month and I told her I would be glad to wait that out with the cat cooped up. A stir-crazy cat is preferable to an injured or dead one. She accused me of wanting the dog dead and I again said that, while I wouldn't hesitate to call animal control if my cat had been killed, it was in my room and so neither were at risk. She said once again it was just a cat, not worth fighting over, and asked again why did I care so much about it? I just left at this point. For the next two days I was either in my bedroom with my cat or at school/work. While I was upset these last two days, I made no threats against my sister's dog, nor did I ask for it to be moved anymore as I thought this was a tenable solution.\n\n\n Today I found out that my sister was planning on swinging by to pick up the dog. I was happy that my cat could once again experience sweet freedom and I sent her a message thanking her for going through such trouble for me, to which she immediately uninvited me to an event we were planning on going together to. She knew that I had spent the last of my cash on cat stuff, and had offered to pay for my ticket. I then found out that she is furious with me as my mother told her she needed to move to dog as soon as possible as I wanted to 'ditch it in the country or murder it.' I suspect that my mother may have been getting tired of having my sister's dog about and used this as a pretext for having it removed a few weeks early. My sister now isn't talking to me and my parent's say I should apologize to her for hurting her feelings, but since I pay rent and they cannot easily make ends meet otherwise that they wouldn't make me. They are just very disappointed and express that disappointment with great frequency.\n\n\ntl:dr: My sister left her dog at my family's house for six weeks and it started to attack my cat. I told them that if my cat was killed that I would report the incident to local animal control, who are rather strict with dogs that bite humans or kill other people's pets. To keep everyone safe and happy, I kept my cat cooped up so that it and the dog wouldn't cross paths and we'd all live happily ever after. Two days into kitty apartheid, my mom who was maybe getting tired of the extra dog told my sister to get her dog out right away as I no doubt secretly savored dreams of dog murder. My sister is now furious that she had to move the dog on short notice and refuses to speak to me.\n\nSo Reddit, this is my question: Am I the asshole or are there no assholes here?",

I'm okay with this, because it's something I've dealt with every 4 years, and at 22, I'm not going to get hurt because I wasn't the center of attention. I don't expect friends to remember as we all have our lives and 22 isn't exactly an important birthday. \n\nHowever, I do hold my parents to a different standard, since both of them have said that I was a huge part of their lives and they've always remembered. I feel like it's worth mentioning that my dad lives in PA due to them being divorced and I live in TX. \n\nI wake up late yesterday after a night out with friends, and I check my phone. Mom, mormor, cousin, and one of my closest friends had wished me a happy birthday. Get to dad's text, and he says his reaction to the election. Nothing else. \n\nIt hurt a lot. I won't pretend I wasn't pretty broken up and spent an hour trying to compose myself to my normal happy self. So I go about my day, just relaxing and playing online with some friends, vented to my best friend, and generally felt better. \n\nI thought I was better, but I went out to eat with the family I have here and ran into a friend from high school. Enjoy the dinner, enjoy the family time, head home. The friend who had been the waiter took the time to message me a happy birthday on Facebook. Then I got pissed at my dad. He always had appeared to place me before things like politics and religion, and I had defended him when my mom and grandma had said things about him. But if someone whose got 4 tables to take care of can find the time to wish a happy birthday to someone who they haven't talked to in 4 years, why couldn't my dad? He's retired. He had the time to text me about the election. It validated, in my head, a lot of the things my mom and grandma had said about my dad. That he had willfully given up custody of me. That he hadn't tried to keep me. That he didn't believe I was his kid when I was first born. \n\nI played back a lot of conversations with my dad from when I still visited him 2-3 times a year. Conversations about child support money if I lived with him. \n\nBut today, I'm realizing that maybe I shouldn't be mad at him for it. He was really involved with this election, and maybe it swept him up. I remembered he's had some medical issues. Maybe I shouldn't take one example, cast all past conversations in that light, and completely flip my opinion. One friend said it wasn't really a dad thing to do anyway, and that I was being kind of unreasonable. \n\nI haven't talked to him, because of the hurt, getting wrapped up with other stuff, and then dinner with family and then being really angry. And I don't want to talk to him when I dunno where I stand. I don't want to be an asshole to him if it was just life getting in the way, but I also do want to confront him if he was in the wrong and it's time to reevaluate where we stand with each other. ",

People, get a grip.\n&gt;\n&gt;$fan - Careful now, 1 careless tweet can cost sponsors!\n&gt;\n&gt;$YT - That tweet won't cost me sponsors. Not even close.\n&gt;\n&gt;$fan - Hope not, just be careful. You are a public figure to your sponsors.\n&gt;\n&gt;$YT - Enough with the PC garbage. That original tweet wasn't offensive or inappropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt;$me - I was with you 100% until you started being aggressive.\n&gt;\n&gt;$YT - Here's a virtual bandaid.\n&gt;\n&gt;$me - Frankly, it's really hard to be a fan when you're such a snarky asshole to anyone with a dissenting opinion on social media. Just my 2 cents\n&gt;\n&gt;$YT - Apparently, one bandaid wasn't enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;$me - I mean you can be that way if you want. Im just saying that people look up to you and this isnt the way to treat them. It sets a bad example\n\n\n\nI know I'm probably in the wrong for stepping in on something that was none of my business and I was probably a little too aggressive, but I would really appreciate some second opinions.

    "selftext": "This morning, I was changing my son in the presence of my wife as we prepared to leave. We carpool to daycare, she works on a college campus, and I attend law school on the same campus, so we're together every morning and afternoon. Things were okay. I had gone to take a shower earlier, and generally she would have changed him during that time, but that's nothing, really.\n\nAs I was changing the kid, he reached down and grabbed the diaper and tugged on it. I said \"Hey!\" in the same manner I scold the cats - habit really. If I hadn't immediately stopped him, the kid would've wound up with about half a cup of baby shit smeared up his side, and we would have had to change him and wipe him down. I caught unholy hell for scolding the kid this way, from the changing table, through the rest of our preparations to leave, and through the morning commute. She even threw the kid's coat at me because I mistakenly thought it was in the closet, when it was in fact in the car. I refused to be brow-beaten, and stood my ground, which resulted in more acrimonious vituperation.\n\nI admit, I often get defensive when I'm attacked like this. I don't think either of us deserves to be treated that way, and I don't think either of us is entitled to treat the other that way. I generally shut my mouth to avoid saying mean things out of impulse, and try to suppress emotional reactions. Getting emotional has never helped in the past, and my wife says she can't handle all that stuff right now, anyway. She just tells me to talk to a professional about it. She has her own stressors - she puts the kid to bed each night, works as a secretary full time, and she's had some kidney stone issues the last week or two. They're being treated, and are not excruciating as such things often can be. Still, it's causing her discomfort and intermittent moderate pain. I do not know if that was happening this morning.\n\nAfter defending myself and 100% disagreeing about what the appropriate course of action would be, I brought up old arguments during the fight. They're personal, but have to do with the way we each see things, and each other. I felt it was on-point, but she felt I was blaming her for my own failings. In prior discussions, she has just kind of refused to address these things, because, as mentioned, she doesn't feel she can deal with it right now.\n\nI have a lot of stress from full time law school, planning and cooking dinner for us all (she and the kid are both pretty picky), doing diaper laundry and adult laundry (she folds more than I do), and cleaning the apartment after she goes to bed to put the kid down. I usually get done with readings for the night about 10:30pm, make bottles and lunch for the kid for the next day, and get to bed at 11:30, then frequently wake up at 4:00 to take the kid to the recliner because he won't sleep. I average about 5.5 hours of sleep in the course of most weeks. I'm not the best husband, but I don't feel like this yelling was proportional or warranted. Was I the asshole?\n\nP.S. I would post this on /r/relationships, but I'm pretty sure I can just type \"get a lawyer, hit the gym, delete Facebook\" in Word and get about the same level of insight.\n\nP.P.S. Poop.",

This is an older lady, probably in the mid 60s.  \nAfter working with us for a couple weeks she asked me if I would mind it if she brought her desk fan because she often felt warm or even hot.   \nWe've never had anyone complain about being hot but everybody is different so I told her I had no problem with it.\n\n\nWell, this fan turned out to be a small little plastic piece of crap that rattles and whines all day long and also resonates onto our half-wall-divided desk.  I can only assume that due to her age she doesn't hear this rattling and whining.  \nThis was annoying, but I figured I could get past it and hopefully have it drown out as \"white noise\". \n\n\nSo the other thing that comes into play here, I started having pretty bad headaches around the time she brought this fan to work.  \nI attributed this to the recent high work load and stress that I've had to deal with so I didn't make the connection.  \nSo after weeks of headaches, one day she was out for a doctors appointment or something and I had no headache whatsoever, and as you guessed it, the next day she came back and the headaches came back.  \nI am apparently fairly sensitive to annoying background sound and it messes with my head.\n\n\nSo I explain the situation to her and asked her if she would mind not using the fan anymore (even though I had initially agreed with it) and if she were to get hot we could possibly reduce the AC temperature by a degree or so to still keep her comfortable (of course without freezing other people).\n\n\nShe agreed, but... hasn't said a word to me since. No good mornings, no small talk, nothing.  \nShe has put effort into avoiding me, asking questions on how to do stuff to everybody but me.\n\n\nAm I The Asshole here?",

I actually appreciate being worth the time.  \n\n\nThere's a caveat though, I won't correct women that I like because that usually never goes well.

I saw them at a wedding and when they heard that I was looking for an apartment in their city they suggested that I should move in with her.

I tend to keep busy on the weekends (I've only even slept at home about 1/3 of the weekend nights that I've lived here), but during the week I tend to just come home, watch some tv, smoke a bowl, eat dinner and go to bed. She's very upset that whenever she gets home from work I'm there, on the couch. I almost always offer her control of the television, but she usually declines. The weed smoking also bothers her some, even though she smokes some herself and I've been a daily smoker as long as I've known either of them. \n\nShe's also upset that I've put some of my kitchen equipment in the kitchen alongside hers. There's room, and I have some quality stuff that I'd hate to give up using, but according to her it's her house and only her stuff should be in there. I kind of feel like we split the rent so it's more \"our\" house, but I was just informed I was incorrect about that fact. \n\nI know I bug her some, so I try to do some extra cleaning and walk her dog for her and stuff to make up for it, but she still finds me intolerable.

Maybe she already bought the gift then but didn't mention it when giving it to us.

    "selftext": "Small update - thank you all so much for taking the time to comment on my question. You've given me a lot of insight and have managed to set my mind at ease a bit. I've decided to stay invisible and have blocked several ways he could use to communicate with me. I will also sit down my husband tonight and tell him what's been going on so we can team up on this together.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted this before on r/Relationships but was advised to post here by mods. \n\nSo I am changing a lot of details, since I have no idea whether this guy frequents Reddit. He just now contacted me again through a social media channel.\n\nSomewhere in the spring this acquaintance on Facebook contacts me. We both post around in the same sports-based community, it's a small world, we sometimes like each others posts on Facebook and Instagram, you get the drift.\n\nHe dm's me on Facebook asking if I live in the neighborhood. I do. We apparently live in the same city, and in the same largish neighborhood. I am reluctant to tell this guy where I live cause I don't know him and I don't want some random guy to be able to pinpoint me in the city. So i vaguely answer.\n\nOver time we get a little more acquainted and start talking some on Facebook. I agree to meet up with him for a couple of sports-related events (3 times in total I think?) and I went to his house once to help him with some computer related issues. Mind you, we are both married. I'm looking for a sports-buddy, nothing more.\n\nHe's kind of weird. For instance, he starts to like all the posts my best friend makes on instagram. She comes to me asking who this guy is. We both thought it pretty weird that he would start liking random mundane pics by someone he's never even met and who is not part of the same sports-community he and I share. Next to that, he's kind of clingy. If I don't talk to him for two days on FB (hey, I've got a busy job, a husband, lots of close friends) he starts asking what he did wrong. He jumps me literally every time I am online on Facebook, so much so that I disable my messenger because it starts to feel uncomfortable. One time when I was sick and he had a race, he texted me with a message along the lines of \"well, it's SO wonderful of you to ask me about how my day went!\" - which of course I hadn't cause i was in bed, sick. I thought that was really weird - attentionwhorish. If I want to know how things went, I'll ask - at a time when I'm feeling well. When I called him out about it, he said it was a joke. I wasn't so sure. In the end I felt uncomfortable enough that I apologized.\n\nHe wants to set up a sports-site and form a community in our city. We brainstorm on that, his ideas are very big while I caution him to start slow and small lest he be disappointed. He doesn't listen. Gets frustrated when things don't go how he wants them to go. He just basically gives off a very weird vibe (there were other small things but too many and to trivial to count as a standalone and to mention here ... but added up ... meh).\n\nI'm not someone who doles out the word \"friendship\" very fast. I have a couple of very very close friends, and someone whom I've seen maybe three or four times is still an acquaintance in my book. I start to feel a little smothered. On top of that, he tells me he's had mental issues all his life, including a diagnosis of narcissistic personality syndrome. Which throws up a huge red flag with me. Call me callous, but this is someone I'm not sure I want a real friendship with anyway on account of the things I've already related above, and this added even more to that feeling.\n\nI start to slowly pull back and not talk to him as much, again soliciting the same questions what he'd done wrong and why I am not talking to him. I find it very hard to explain to him - I mean, you don't just say \"you're plain weird dude,\" to someone. So I guess I do the stupid thing and make excuses or give vague answers. I then suffer a sports-injury which is not looking promising, so I have to give up sports for a while anyway. Which leads me to drop out of the community, the text group and to withdraw. I do not block him, but simply cease speaking to him. I know he is upset. I've not answered any of his messages, have basically ghosted him.\n\nI do feel bad about it, but on the other hand I'm sure he wouldn't have taken it well if I told him why. Should I have handled things differently?\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Made an acquaintance who gave off a distinctly weird vibe - ghosted him. Should I have done things differently?

I've never heard her make the sounds she was making then. I tried to pull the animals apart but I couldn't. All the while my neighbors, couple in their 30s, were standing in their yard saying \"sorry!\" while I wasyelling \"oh my god\" as their dog continued to attack.

They were still apologizing. I was full of adrenaline and pretty pissed, but feel like I handled it well by saying \"It's okay. I understand. It happens. I work with dogs.\" I also added \"Sorry I had to kick your dog a little..\"\n\nSo we left it at that and parted ways, but as my neighbor was walking away she said with her back to me, \"Hopefully you don't kick the dogs you work with.\"\n\nI am so pissed! I would've been fine with the situation, let it go and forgotten about it, as my dog is completely fine. But her snide comment left me fuming. I didn't kick their dog with all my might, just enough to separate them. And the neighbors were doing nothing to intervene when it was THEIR animal who was attacking mine. It was a split second action and if I hadn't kicked it I feel like my little dog could have been seriously injured. \n\nReddit, you tell me. Am I the asshole?  Had my neighbor not made that final remark, I wouldn't have thought so. But now I'm a mix of pissed and confused as to why she said that.

The day before he comes up he tells me that he is bringing Rachel. I get annoyed but hey I get to see Jake. Jake comes the next with Rachel and we go get lunch and we go out to a mall to walk and talk. Everything is going great Rachel actually isn't bad. Fast forward to that night and we are taking shots at my house to pre-game for a  club that we are going to later. We end up finishing a bottle of medium sized bottle of Jager and Rachel is drunk (Jake said she could wasn't a light weight). Rachel starts asking me why I hate her and why I told Jake to break up with her. I told her that Ive heard for a couple of people that she cheated on her previous boyfriend a lot of times. She then has this face like she is annoyed. She goes on to say that her previous boyfriend was one of the biggest liars she ever knew. He went and spread rumors that she cheated on him when in reality it was the opposite. She goes to show me some messages that she screen shotted with her telling off her EX saying how she can't believe he said that she was the cheater and his responds was just \"Ha\". So after that I began to apologize and say I shouldn't listen to what other people say. She forgave me because she would've done the same with her friend. \n\nWe end up going to the club with a friend of mine who we are going to call Marcus. By the time we get to the club Rachel was very drunk, we shouldn't have even gone but oh well. When we are inside Jake ends up going to the bathroom and Marcus and I are left to make sure Rachel drinks water and doesn't get too crazy. Jake is gone for a while and when he finally shows up he pulls Marcus and I aside and tells us that he seen this girl who we are going to call Jackie. Now Jackie and Jake have known each other for a loooong time. It was very weird that he bumped into her because this is 5 hours away from where we used to live. I guess she lives in the same city. Jackie and Jake have had a weird relationship Jackie was in a relationship for a long time but Jake always loved her. Jackie knew that but she was in a serious relationship. They drifted apart when she got engaged. Jake tells us that Jackie ended the engagement and that he wanted to date/hook up with her (I don't remember what he wanted to do exactly). He said he was going try to talk to her again. Marcus says to go for it but I don't say anything. After about an hour of drinking and taking care of Rachel we decide to call it a night. \n\nJake, Rachel, and I are back at mine place while Marcus headed home. Jake stays in the living room on his phone while I am helping Rachel to the toilet where she throws up. Rachel begins to tell me that she saw Jackie there and she saw Jake talking to her. Rachel knew about Jake's history with her. She asked what was going on and I tell her Im pretty sure they just said Hi and that's it. I go out into the living room and I see Jake talking to Jackie. I don't even say anything and I go back to Rachel. Rachel starts saying what if it was just more than them just saying Hi and I say its nothing. I help Rachel out of the bathroom and set up a bed in the living room. We finally all get to sleep.\n\nThe next day we were all trying to cure our hangovers and while we are doing so Rachel and I find out that we are basically the exact same person. We like the same music, we act the same, we watch the same shows, we have the same interests, we both used to do the same while we grew up, and so on. I guess I know what Jake saw in Rachel if him and I were best friends. \n\nThe next day when Jake is packing up their thing to leave Rachel comes to me and asks if she should just drop the whole thing about Jake and Jackie. I tell her yes even though I really hate cheaters. I tell her again that its nothing and she shouldn't be worried. Rachel and I swap numbers and she says ok its dropped. \n\nOver the past couple of weeks Rachel and I have been texting a lot and talking about various things. Rachel tells me how Jake isn't a good boyfriend but she loves him a lot and can't lose him. I tell her that if she is unhappy then she shouldn't be with him. I tell her that it seems like Jake doesn't have the same feelings and if he doesn't treat her well then why are they together. \n\nToday she asked if I was keeping something from her. She asked if I was keeping any secrets to protect Jake. I tell her no but I guess the way I put it made her to call me twice and tell me that if I know something then I should tell her. I hated lying to her when she was here so I told her everything about Jake and Jackie and how he was trying to hook up with her. After I tell her she hangs up on me and immediately starts asking Jake about it. Jake texts me \"What the hell (name)\" \"Why did you tell Rachel\" I then tell him that I stood up for him for all the times she wanted to break up with you but I said maybe you are going through some tough times at work and thats why you aren't being good. I also say that I lied to her for a while and couldn't do it anymore. Rachel then starts telling that Im one of the worst guys she has ever known because I lied to her face when I said it was nothing. Now neither of them have responded to my texts and I think I lost 2 good friends.\n\n This all happened about 2 hours ago now because it took me a while to type all this out. Im sorry if its badly written. Ive been drinking since all this happened. I don't know if I'm the asshole or what. I would like to know if there is anything I could do to help get at least one of them back as a friend.",

He likes to come in my room when I am not gone and play my PS4 though. He used to use my computer and my kindle until I locked him out of both as he was messing up my stuff. I told him to not play unless he asks me first as sometimes I have another game in the slot and it messes it up when he plays something else. But the problem was he would always come in and play my PS4 even when I told him numerous times to not touch it unless he asks me. He always goes in and plays when I am at work. SO I told him if he enters my room again without me knowing then he wont play PS4 for a day. I woke up this morning and my remote for my tv was out of my room and mysteriously in the living room (the living room one was broke and only mine works for it). I got angry and when he got back from school I told him he is not playing PS4 for today he even tried to say it wasnt him who took it. Then later on in the day he was swinging his little school id badge around and it hit me in the face in front of everyone, my mom yelled at him and he was calm finally. I took him aside though and said he is not playing tomorrow either, he was upset but I told him to stop disrespecting me. I kinda feel like an Asshole but at the same time not really as I have warned him numerous times to not touch my stuff.  ",

    "selftext": "Recently (over the past month or two) my girlfriend's mother has been in poor health (cancer, but it's relatively under control and she's going through chemo and surgeries). Tonight that, a friend's family member dying, and pain from period really hit her hard. She was crying and upset. I walked her home and we hung out in her apartment where she confessed that these things have been hitting her hard today. I tried my best to support her (we pretty much cuddled and talked about it the entire time). I was there from about 11-11:30 PM to 3:15-3:30 am.\n\nAt around 3:05 she told me I could leave if I want (as I wasn't feeling particularly well). She said this a few times over the course of the night. I said nah and said I'd stay for a little longer. At around 3:20-3:30 I started feeling really sick and mentioned that it was getting late and I should be going. She told me she'd be fine and that she was doing better. She acted a little sad at me leaving but was ultimately like \"alright\". Because she seemed sad about it I asked her if she wants me to stay, she said \"well if you're not feeling well you should go\". Since I was feeling pretty sick (almost on the verge of throwing up), I left. I made the same offer to stay multiple times before I actually left.\n\nI get home, we talk a little bit. She seems to be doing alright (talking a lot about a music she's listening to but doesn't like). I say I need to rest and we part by saying \"I love you\" on Skype. I go to rest and start playing a game. 40 minutes later she deletes the \"I love you\" message she sent me on Skype and sent me an angry \"goodnight\" message. I asked what that was about, and we got into an argument.\n\nHer argument was basically \"I needed you and you weren't there for me, you left me while I was sad, you don't care about me at all\", in much harsher language\n\nMy argument to that was basically \"You told me I could go, I wasn't feeling well, and I offered to stay if you needed me and you declined\"\n\nI feel like I've done my best to support her, been spending a lot of time with her, talking and reassuring her throughout the whole situation. \n\nThe one big thing that irks me here is that she told me I could go, then got mad at me for going. She defended this by saying \"It was just a comment\", which is complete bullshit in my opinion. But she still seems pretty adamant that I'm the asshole for leaving when she told me I could multiple times and I wasn't feeling very well. I understand she's going through a tough time but I did spend the past 4-4.5 hours supporting her and I wasn't feeling well.",

    "selftext": "So I have friend who I've known since we were 5 years old.  We are 25 now.  So a 20 year relationship in which we have had many fun times together and share a sizable group of mutual friends.  We grew up together because our families have gone to the same church since we were kids.  We had spent many nights back in high school hanging out and having fun with all of our friends from church.\n\nFast forward to college and we attended different schools and sort of lost touch, only seeing each other when everybody was in town for the holidays.  It was no secret that he stayed heavily involved in church activities while at his school, whereas I had opened myself up to the party scene a bit while at mine.  The girl he married has also been apart of this same friend group with us for years.  Although I have always had some strange suspicion that she didn't like me for whatever reason that I've never been able to figure out.\n\nFast forward to post college life and everybody has moved back to our home town area for the most part.  My friend gets married to this girl and the only way I ever found out about it was through Facebook.  At first I was fine, I had seen their marriage coming for a while.  But then as I clicked through the photos, I noticed that all of our mutual friends had been there to celebrate with them.  I was the only one missing.  Now, to be clear, I never expected to be anybody's groomsmen, but figured I was a shoe in for being in attendance.  But that never happened.\n\nFast forward to Easter Sunday at our church a few months ago and everybody is in town again. I saw him and his new wife from across the way but noticed that he seemed to be avoiding my gaze multiple times.  A little time passes and him and I end up crossing paths in the hall way, creating an unavoidable conversation.  We exchange awkward greetings to one another and ask how each other has been.  He exclaims everything is wonderful and says, \"You know Addie and I are married now, right?!?!\"  And my response was, \"Oh yeah, I saw that on Facebook, hate that I wasn't able to make it...\"  He gave an awkward laugh and a long drawn out \"yeahhhhh\".  After a moment of silence, I said \"Well, good to see you man, have a nice life.\" and gave a half hearted smile and walked away.\n\nI never turned back around to see his reaction but ever since then, each time we see each other at church, he turns and walks in the other direction or begins conversation with someone near him.  And his family has all but shunned my parents after years of get togethers growing up.  Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for thinking I should have been invited to an old friend's wedding and then called him out about not inviting me when I saw him for the first time after the wedding?\n\n\nUpdate: \n\nI appreciate everyone's input. There have been plenty of indications over the course of the past 5 years that our friendship wasn't dead. I could elaborate but you all would probably not be interested since I abandoned this post the last couple days. \n\nBut to sum it up, I don't feel bad about what I said, although I admit I could have approached it much differently than I did. But had I done so it probably would have been met with the same response knowing this guy's personality. He's always been the \"alpha-Christian\" of our group so to speak and his wife was the same for the female side of the group. \n\nSo I truly believe deep down that this had some sort of judgmental undertones in regards to my drinking and partying behavior that, might I add, was never mentioned to me by him but I'm sure he heard about through the rumor mill. So I guess that's what irks me the most is that the two of them think so highly of themselves as Christ followers yet have written me off as a decent human being because I'm genuine..if that makes sense. I guess I just said what I said out of frustration and wanting him to know that I didn't appreciate being judged by them.\n\nOf course on a side note, it may have something to do with the fact that I know his wife wasn't a virgin like he was/is and she cheated, albeit emotionally, on her college bf with him prior to them officially becoming a couple. Perhaps she painted a bleak image of me to him as a means of keeping me from spilling the beans about her to him. Idk. Thanks for all the responses though and I'll try and be a better OP next time :) !!\n",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR I bought a book for an old friend I haven't seen in seven years. Felt very uncomfortable at the party because everyone else kept to themselves and when he still hadn't arrived after 50 minutes, I left. He texted me asking me to leave the book with the bartender so I did, and he has not thanked me or said anything to me since. Am I an asshole for being annoyed?**\n\n\nI have an old high school friend, Michael, that I haven't seen since graduation seven years ago. We've spoken a handful of times on Facebook.\n\nTwo months ago he sent me an invite to his birthday party which he was holding in a student bar. The invite list included a lot of old high school people (a snobby group I never really got along with) and I didn't really want to go because that + student bar for a 25th birthday made me feel like we were trapped in the past and never changing, if you get what I mean. I still wanted to see Michael and introduce my boyfriend to some people from my past so I let him know we'd be there for an hour. Michael says sweet.\n\nI tell him I'm getting him a present whether he likes it or not (I knew he'd be polite and say no) so he might as well give me an idea of something he likes so the money isn't wasted. He asks for a book, and after some questions, I pick one out that I think he'd love (Ready Player One by Ernest Cline).\n\nThe birthday party was last weekend at 8pm. I live 25km from the bar. I arrived there with my boyfriend, walk into the bar and find that it's completely empty except for a large group of people sitting at a table/booth with no spare seats, all laughing loudly and shooting us sideways smirks. Feels very high school. I'm fairly sure they're his friends but I don't know for certain.\n\nAnyway. I text Michael and he sends me a couple \"I'm nearly there, sorry I'm late\". 50 minutes pass with the other group still shooting us looks and it's clear Michael is nowhere near here. I am sick of this (it was a student bar so really dark and shitty) so I tell him \"I gotta duck off in ten mins bro\" and he texts me \" I understand and I am so sorry\" and \"please feel free to leave the book with the bartender\" and \"I will grab it and send a photo to you\". I'd been planning on taking the book with me and giving it to someone else but when I got that text we left it with the bartender and drove back home. It's been five days and Michael has not messaged me anything since.\n\nThings to note:\n\n* I've talked to him like three times over seven years through text, so we're hardly close. I told him a month ago that I could only stay for an hour and he acknowledged that.\n\n* He never asked me for the present before the party. He would have politely refused it initially so I think it's unfair to be annoyed that he didn't thank me for something he didn't *really* ask me for.\n\n* I know how shit it feels to have friends ditch your birthday because they won't know more than 3 people there so I do think it was a bit mean to have left.\n\n* I guess there's a chance he got too drunk to remember to take the book or he was waiting until after he'd finished reading it to text me, but I feel like asking him if he got it might feel passive aggressive.\n\n\nObviously this doesn't affect my day to day life at all since we barely spoke beforehand. I'm just genuinely wondering if I'm expecting too much?",

On top of that he's cheated on my sister (I even told her he was WITH PROOF, and he said I was just a liar, and my sister believed him saying I was just jealous of their relationship, so now this man both hates and has a grudge against me), and abuses his pain medication to get high. \n\n\nMy family sees nothing wrong with him because he \"puts on a good face\" around them and acts completely sweet and spoiling to my mother (Who is basically a narcissist so anyone who thinks she's good can do no wrong)\n\n\n\nI do not feel safe at all around this man as a young woman myself, and I do not feel at all safe bringing my young son around him either.\n\n\n\nMy mother and sister know that I don't like this man or feel safe around him and yet they brought him anyways in complete disregard. \n\n\n\nMy sister and this man have been dating /less than a year/ but they were friends at ages 12-14, however he left town and was gone for a very long time, they are around thirty now and my family doesn't seem to realize people change, but because they were friends during childhood my family thinks that makes him safe. I do not.\n\n\n\nMe and my son rarely get to see my little cousins and my aunties who we both love and miss very much, but because of this man being there I'm refusing to go even though we're \"invited\". I think it's extremely unfair that me and my son are being penalized because my sister wants to bring her boyfriend. These family members are mine and my sons, not his.\n\n\nI don't think it's fair or reasonable that someone who is almost a stranger should be put before actual family. Yet everyone seems to think that I'm being the unreasonable one for not wanting to go, even though I think my reasons are very good ones. In my opinion I think if my sister wants to spend the holiday with her boyfriend she should go spend it with his family. I don't think that me and my son should be the ones who have to be excluded.\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a petty reason like \"I just don't like him\" (although I really really do not) it's that mostly I don't want this man around my child when he has a history of violence and substance abuse.\n\n\n\nI don't think that I should have to feel unsafe or uncomfortable around my own family for someone who isn't even related to us.\n\n\n\nAccording to them I have the \"option\" to go, but I don't feel like I'm being given a choice at all, and I'm being hurt very badly by it. They don't seem to care at all though that I'm bothered because it's 'not a problem' to them at all. I wouldn't be upset about it if it wasn't a big deal, I just want to see my family and I feel like my mother and sister are taking that away from me by making it such an unappealing hurdle.\n\n\n\nAnd the location is NOT my mothers or sisters house either. It's at my grandmothers so if anything they shouldn't even be the ones making the choice. I feel like if I mentioned anything to my grandma though she would disregard it too (I really don't have a clue what her opinion on him is but I would imagine she has no reason not to like him and would stick with my mother and sister) I really have no way to predict her reaction though and really at this point its too late to even say anything since they're probably all already eating as I type.\n\nSo am I the asshole for thinking that an SO shouldn't come before family? Am I the asshole for not going to this event when I feel there is a genuine safety concern for me and my son? Am I the asshole for not just \"sucking it up and going\"?",

    "selftext": "Basically I live in a shared house with 3 girls, all students - 2 have lived here for ~2 years, I moved in 4 months ago. Girl 1 lives downstairs in a room along the corridor to the kitchen. Girl 2 lives in the upstairs room opposite mine. When I moved in, the only room free was upstairs, next to the bathroom. Last year the landlord removed the door separating the kitchen and the hallway leading to Girl 1's room for some renovation work. Over a year later, there's no door as he says the fridge freezer next to the arch means a door won't fit, now Girl 1 can hear everything from the kitchen.\n\nI stay awake until about half 12 - 1am frequently - I have a job at weekends during the day so study late on weeknights. My use of the kitchen has caused tension with Girl 1. Girl 2 has stayed out of all of this and shares similar early bedtimes with Girl 1, but has never complained about noise.\n\nGirl 1 often goes to bed at about 11pm and gets really aggravated that I keep using the kitchen after 11pm - in fact, she hates the sound of people using the creaky stairs and claims to be such a light sleeper that the sound of me opening the fridge wakes her up so she really doesn't like me going downstairs at all after 11.\n\nI try to work around it and avoid the kitchen but the kettle is in there and it being colder now, I needed my hot water bottle. Every time I go down she opens her door, says I've woken her up and asked me why I'm down there. I feel like a scolded child. The worse thing is she laughs it off in the morning about her being grouchy (but seriously reminds me about the kitchen noise all the time). \n\nThis is such a hard one for me to call. I don't want to be an arse here but being told not to go downstairs in your own (shared) house is really inconvenient. I bought a kettle to keep in my room but going downstairs for a mug, the milk in the fridge, the folder I left downstairs is still grating to her. \n\nI think she should pursue the landlord to reinstall the door or just at the very least stop the scolding.

He tends to demand me to do certain things and I usually listen to him and when I don't, we usually end up fighting/arguing.\n\nSo yesterday we (my parents and I) were invited by some family friends over to their house (they live 30-40 km away from as) and dad insisted that I go with them, but I immediately denied as I really don't get along well with those people and I usually end up sitting in a corner extremely bored with no one to talk to, as all of the guests are about 30 years older than me), plus I'm going to have 3 tests next week and thought that it would be better to stay home and maybe study than go there and die out of boredom. Fast forward to today, I agreed to go (as both of my parents insisted) with them after all, but just when we were about to leave home, dad said that he wants me to drive, as he wants to drink there. (did not mention before, but I also hate driving with dad near me, as he gets angry extremely fast if I do something wrong and it stresses the fuck out of me). I told him that I don't want to drive there for the following reasons:\n1) I get stressed driving with him \n2) I don't like those people and I want to at least have a few drinks there so I could feel a bit better\n3) I also have social anxiety and a beer or two helps me with that (he also knows this, and was completely fine with me drinking a few beers if it makes me feel better, in general).\nAlright, so after I declined he got insanely mad and started screaming and evetually told me to stay home as he doesn't even want me to come with them anymore. I told him that I don't give a shit, as I didn't want to go there in the first place and he replied that I'm a spoiled child and to go f*ck myself. Honestly, it pisses me off that he insisted that I go with them against my will and then he even wanted me to drive there. So basically AITA?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies!",

I will admit that it's unfair that most Christian holidays are Canada's federal holidays, but whatareyougonnado.

She knows all this.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time in the last couple weeks that she's ranted a little about Christmas' racism and exclusion.

I didn't think anything of it. It didn't feel like a negative interaction to me. But I guess I really struck a nerve, because about an hour later she sent me an instant message basically saying \"I can hate Christmas and all the racist things about it and still like pictures of cats,\" but longer. I couldn't think of anything to say so I just didn't reply.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike, ok? Yes? Of course you can? I was just teasing... It wasn't like I was roasting her loudly in front of all our friends, it was just a quiet smiling prod, like we do sometimes.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, she hasn't talked to me since.

    "selftext": "  Hello!  To preface this, there's around 2 weeks left in the semester (including finals week) and I'm a senior in high school.  Throughout the school year, my attendance has been dreadful due to medical reasons.  I've averaged missing more days than I've attended, and this has made it difficult to keep up with all my classes. (I have 8 classes because I need credits, average is 6)  The medical reasons have been legitimized through the school, and I've been put on an accommodation program.  \n\n    Throughout the semester, one class that has been particularly difficult for me to keep up with has been Yoga, believe it or not.  A large portion comes from participation, and my not being there nets me very few points.  The teacher has said that I have to make up those points, and she won't waive them as it would be unfair to the other students.  This means making up participation through after school weight lifting, or 3rd party yoga classes.  These are really hard for me to attend, though, as I don't have a lot of free time on my hands.  My time after school goes towards making up tests and quizzes I've missed in other classes 90% of the time.  \n\n   This means the project in question is important, a large portion of my grade may rest on it - as well as the gym credit I need to graduate.  \n\n   The project in question was assigned at the very beginning of the year, at the introduction to the class.  It was described as a \"turn in whenever you want before the end of the semester\" type of deal.   \n\n     I've completely spaced said project, and found it was due the day I came back after an absence spree.  I asked the teacher if I could turn it in the very next day, to which she responded it was too late.  \n\n     The project isn't very hard, and I don't believe it would take me very long.  I always give my 100% in class, and haven't missed a participation point when present. The \"project\" I've been talking about is as simple as taking a before/after picture of cleaning my room and writing a paragraph about it, or doing something similar. \n\n    I just feel like I spaced this project because I have a ton going on.  I've kind of placed yoga low on the priority list as I have much more difficult classes, and tasks (applying to college) that I've needed to take care of.   \n\n   At the same time though, this project was assigned at the beginning of the year.  I had a lot of time to complete this, and at the end of the day I didn't get a super simple project done in the span of months.  I 100% see where she's coming from.\n\n   I'd like to potentially ask her once more if there's any exception she could make.  Is this a bad move?  Am I in the wrong?\n\n   Thank you very much. ",

His coffee table was always cluttered with shit like bags, boxes, remotes, old plates, cups, cans and just other crap. His dining room table was the same way and both tables were always sticky. His couches now have these nasty brown and black stains on them as well as the pillows. His shelves and dressers are covered in dust that's now turning into sand. He also recently has an infestation of roaches. The last time I went over there were some in the bathroom sink and I said, \"gross!\" out loud. He seemed pretty offended by it. In short, his place is pretty nasty. Even some of our other friends agree with me on this and a couple of them have recently said they don't enjoy going there anymore because it's just uncomfortable to be in.\n\nWell, the other day he invited me over and I told him I couldn't go because I had to work on some stuff for finals. I could've easily done the stuff at his house but I just didn't want to go because it's tough to feel comfortable there. He kept insisting that I go to his place and after a few minutes he finally asked why I didn't want to go. I told him it's because his place is a mess, it's nasty and it smells there. I said it in pretty much those exact words. I then told him that his place is pretty messy and that if he wants people to continue going over he has to start cleaning up. Mike then went nuts and went on a long rant. Then he stormed off.\n\nThe other day I tried texting him to see if he wanted hang out and he never replied. Yesterday I tried calling him and texting him and he just told me to leave him alone. I do feel bad about the way I went about telling him how messy his place is, but it's seriously a disaster. He's in his 30's and lives alone yet he somehow thinks thats an excuse to not clean up anything. I don't mind hanging out with him at all. But going to his place is another story. So AITA for telling my friend his place is nasty?\n",

Every day I was made fun of for my weight, to the degree that the ride home was more or less a daily roast session hosted by the older kids. \n\nThis one kid, Ethan, had cancer and was one of the biggest dicks Ive ever met. When other kids made \"oh look at roly poly\" style rips he would just straight face tell me I was fat and more kr less beneath him. One day it got real bad and mustering up all that 8-9 year old wit I shouted \"shut up, you have cancer\" in a fit of rage. Now I immediately knew I fucked up when the entire bus dropped to church mouse levels of quite and not one of the thirty or so kids made a noise for the remainder of the forty five minute ride. \n\nYears pass, Im fifteen or so at this point and Ethan dies. Im talking to my friends in private and one of them starts getting uppity about \"that time you made fun of the kid with cancer\".

I repeatedly have told my girlfriend that we should just keep the windows closed during the winter, because we are waisting money and energy keeping them open, but she insists she needs to \"change the air\".\n\nI think it's a cultural thing, because she is from the south of Italy where it maybe gets down to 10 degrees (50F) during the winter, so she's not used to real cold.

But she constantly talks about wanting to die. Like in completely innocent situations such as being asked what she wants to do after high school, she'd say \"die\". She is *constantly* saying stuff like this. She also isolated herself from the rest of our friend group (four of us total).\n\nAnother thing she does is yell a lot, which really stresses me out. I am not good with people yelling, but whenever someone annoyed her she would shout at them, even if it was just some random nearby person that we didn't know. She can also be somewhat rude, pretentious, and very annoying and abrasive.\n\nRecently, we got in an argument about something that doesn't really matter. We both got very upset, and because of the heightened emotions, I brought up the issues mentioned above and said that maybe we should just stop being friends as her behavior was constantly bringing me down. I have worked very hard to get out of the \"constantly talking about death\" mindset of depression, and being around her kind of brings me back to it.\n\nShe acted like I just didn't want to be friends with her because she was depressed, which is kinda true. I know I would feel shitty if someone said this stuff to me, but I also make an effort to be positive around others. \n\nSo, Reddit. Am I the asshole for not wanting to be around her anymore?

    "selftext": "It is a bitter, ranty, complex post but I need help tonight. Please ask any questions, I desperately need advice. \n\nWhen I was 12, my parents got a divorce after my mother had an affair. It was a bitter couple of years and my sister and I ended up living with my mom after a messy bunch of stuff went on (we refused to pick a parent because that's a fucking horrid thing for a kid to have to do). My dad then lived with a woman who had two kids from a previous relationship, they married a few years later. \n\nFast forward 10 years. This year dad seems to have forgotten my birthday. He sent an apologetic FB message and a card (postmarked as having been sent the day after my birthday) arrived 10 days after my birthday. There was then silence. This was 3 months ago. \n\nThis is part of a cycle. The woman he married had two young kids, he effectively raised them and I have been putting up with second place for years. His partner criticises me and my sister openly, blaming us for actions in the divorce (you know, when we were 12 and 13) and seems to see us as extensions of our mother. She seems to be quite needy, refusing us time to spend with dad alone. I think she is quite manipulative, dad seems taken in by it all - even spending thousands to get her out of debt within a year of getting together with her. She acts nice to my face usually, but she can be vicious when she feels she must stick up for my dad against me complaining about not seeing him enough.  \n\nDad is in a constant cycle of not contacting me for months, only to reach out and end up saying how shit a dad he is/ begging me for forgiveness/ promising he'll stay in contact more. My mom says he loves to please everybody and often fails, this is an extension of that. I feel manipulated by his actions and guilted into constantly \"forgiving\" him by people around him, I am sick of getting \"he's your dad, don't you love him?\" I am so hurt, I feel broken. \n\nBecause I am angry. After moving away to university 3 years ago and now on the verge of moving in with a partner, starting my proper adult life, I am so very angry and hurt. I thought the divorce would have stopped having such an impact on me after all these years but I have thought about the relationships I have with family more. I feel empowered, as though with independence and separation from home I have found a voice and I am sick of being the meek push over. \n\nThis morning he texted me, first time since the birthday, to ask if I could please check the stores in my area for an item that is sold out in his city (my home city, I don't visit often), a present for his step kids. Then he asked what I wanted from Christmas and I so wanted to reply \"how about a fucking birthday present?\"\n\nMy heart is just hammering away as I type. I am sick of going along with the whims of this man, I want a one on one discussion about this treatment. I have done this previously and my stepmom has gone on the war path, moreso than my dad, she makes out that I'm a terrible person but all I wanted was time with my dad. He was angry with me and cried, I felt terrible and forgave him again and again. All the while this anger was growing inside me. \n\nI just don't want to deal with this any more. If he loves me then why does he go along with what stepmom wants all the time? I wonder if a part of him just doesn't like/care for me any more. I want to separate from him a little, I don't want to feel this constant sense of rejection. Does that make me an arsehole? ",

While doing so another male about age 25-30 was in the next isle over and walked to me and the employee and interrupted and said \"Jewlery scale huh? Sure i bet you will use that for jewlery\". I just ignored him and proceeded to talk to the store clerk and he said they didn't carry that. So i shook the clerks hand and said well i appreciate you checking for me and said thank you and proceeded to walk to the register to pay for my other items. \n\nSo i walk up to the front of the store waiting in line. Then the same guy walks up to me and starts being even louder and saying degrading things then proceeded to keep talking. So i looked him in the eye finally said \"Just mind your own damn business man\" in a firm voice so i could get my point across to leave me alone. Then i proceed and walked up to the register. \n\nAfter i checked out then i saw he was following me in the parking lot. he was yelling at me as i was walking to my car Keep in mind i had a family member there that is a child. So i quickly opened up my car put the family member in the car locked it and grabbed my bat.\n\nHe was about 15 to 20 feet away. And i pointed the bat at him and yelled. \"Leave me the fuck alone\". And he went from a fast pace walk to slowly creeping forward so i lunged forward swinging the bat. I didnt make contact with him i was just trying to scare him off as at this point i thought my life was in danger. I was about 10 feet away from him when i started swinging then he ran off. \n\nI don't like violence but i didn't know what to do i wanted to make sure that my family member was protected. Most of my family is gone because of deaths in the family. So my family is getting smaller and smaller each year. So i take safety with family very very seriously.\n\nAm I An Asshole?\n\n\n\n",

She lived with us for about 3/4 years, I was young (maybe 6/7 making her 13/14). We grew close. She moved out and we didn't talk as much. We would see each other at family outings and chat. When I became an adult (18) we reconnected and we hung out maybe 6 months or so. She married and moved, but I visited on three/four occasions. We never really kept in close contact. A sporadic email or Facebook message here or there. The last time I saw her was over 4 years ago at her step-fathers funeral. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI get the news yesterday that my cousin is in the hospital. She was having open heart surgery (which I didn't even know about)  and there were complications. She is currently on a feeding tube and it doesn't look hopeful for her to 'come out' alive. I found out after I received a call my aunt (not her mom) and  comment she made struck a cord with me and I find myself posting here. She said \"Its been so long since I've heard from you\". I replied, \"Well the phone rings both ways.\" and she said something like my number hasn't changed in 20 years (she got my current number from my mom). She didn't even know I was living in another country not he other side of the world. The fact of the matter is, we don't talk. We don't keep in touch. Thats how it is with almost all of my family. But I'm the one being held responsible for not reaching out? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm of course sadden but the news, my cousin has three kids, two step children and a husband. Its been difficult for her having cancer at such a young age as well as all the other curve balls life has thrown her. But there's a part of me that isn't upset. At least I don't feel like I'm as upset as 'I should be'. Like all of this is terrible but it doesn't effect me. I know it will effect my family, but I'm not close to them either. So I could be sad that they are sad and know the issues they go through, but I feel isolated.

    "selftext": "2 years ago I moved into a house with 2 friends of mine. One of them, Doug, brought a washer and dryer into the house. His parents inherited it from his grandma after she passed away. \n\nWe lived together for 2 years all using the washer and dryer yada yada. After the first 2 years, both of the roommates had to move out. Doug was going to live on campus, so he didn't really have a need for the washer and dryer. We discussed it and figured it would be easiest for him to leave them and sell them to me (to split with my 2 new roommates) since he didn't want to move them and I didn't particularly want to move in a new set. I agreed to this at the time and he talked to his parents about what they wanted for the washer and dryer. This was in July. \n\nJump to December. Doug never followed up and asked for any money from me. We had hung out multiple times, met up for dinner, seen each other at parties, etc and it was never brought up. \n\nOne week ago we met up for dinner and very non-organically Doug asks for $300 for the washer and dryer. Prior to this, I was offered a new washer and dryer from my neighbors for free. They were upgrading and their old set was a considerable step up from what Doug had. My current roommates were excited by this (more energy efficient, less water usage, not terribly old) and they have very little extra cash. \n\nSince Doug has moved out, his dryer has stopped being as effective. It will still dry stuff, but only if you run it about 2-3 times. I told him about the situation and asked if he could do any better on the price since $300 felt like a lot for two very old appliances, the washer of which can't have the door closed or it will reek of mold (this was present when he lived here) and the dryer now not working as well. Doug said he could not do any better on the price, but could take $150 now and then $150 in January. \n\nI'm not really sure how to feel about this. My current roommates have said they don't really have the money to just throw away currently, especially around the holidays. I'm a little peeved at Doug for his handling of the situation. \n\nRight now I'm considering offering to help sell them for him on Craigslist and whatever they sell for he gets. I'll facilitate the sale of them and helping whoever comes to pick them up. It just seems random to all of a sudden want the money conveniently around the holidays. I'd be more understanding if these were appliances he had bought himself, but I know that is not the case. I also know that his parents are not getting this money because if they were, I'm sure the deal would have gone through far earlier back when he was asking them about it. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way? Should I just give him the $300? I really don't have the money to spare. Thank you. ",

He used to always text back right away.  Then it became few hours, which was fine.  Then a day which became little frustrating but also fine.  Now it takes days to couple weeks to hear back.  And often its simple things like \"hey do you want to hang out this week\" or \"Should I do this/that\".  I told him that it was ridiculous and incredibly frustrating that I could get faster response from normal people through snail mail then I could from texting him.  He got pissed off at me and told me he's just bad at texting and that he does it to everyone and doesn't see why it matters.  I told him any reasonable person would get pissed from being ignored for days to weeks at a time.

I let this slide for a while because it didn't bother me but one time it kinda did bother me so I brought it up to my friend. I said something to the affect of \"hey could you just call me before you plan on coming to my house next time I find it disrespectful when you just show up at my house\" He agreed to calling me next time he plans on coming to my house to go out. I thought that was the end of it. But that following week he (along with my other friends) just showed up to my house. I was asleep, tired as fuck and I wake up to a call saying \"I'm out the front\" in a demanding type of tone. So at this point I'm pretty annoyed, especially considering I had just talked to him about this. Anyway I hung up the phone and messaged him telling him to leave and after about 10 minutes of begging me to come out he eventually left. I'm still pretty pissed about it to be honest.

There isn't enough room in my driveway for my SO to park when he visits, so he parks along the curb in the court.\nThe space where he parks is \"in front\" of a neighbour's house. I say \"in front\", because due to the nature of the court, it's actually more off to the side and his truck can't be seen from any of their windows.\n\nAnyway, he's always parked there, never any issues. I've even approached them a few times to ask them if they were sure they were okay with him parking there (just extending the courtesy), to which they replied they have no problem with it.\n\nNow for the last few days (after years of no issue), my neighbour and his wife have been taking turns with one of them parking in the driveway (that can fit at least 6 cars), and the other parking on the street where my SO usually parks. For reference, there is no work being done on their home or driveway, or any other reason why they would need to keep their driveway clear (especially since one of the two cars remains in the driveway anyway)\n\nIt seems like a clearly deliberate passive-aggressive gesture meant to say \"don't park here\". But from my perspective, beyond the fact that I've already asked them if they were cool a bunch of times, they don't own the street adjacent to their house, so I can't see why they think they can claim it like that. I could understand if maybe it was directly out front of their home and they were tired of looking out their window and seeing a car right there, but that's not the case at all.\n\nBasically I want to know if I'm the asshole here before I make my next move. I want to confront them (politely), but I don't want to confront them if it turns out I'm in the wrong anyway, because that would just be a waste of everybody's time.\n\nFor reference, yes there are bylaws about street parking in my town. No more than 3 hours, not between 3-5 am. So while I understand I am technically beholden to the bylaws, there are tons of cars parked on our street daily and no other neighbour has ever raised a fuss with any other neighbour about it before. Our street has a very \"live and let live\" vibe unless somebody's actions are obviously intrusive or inconvenient.\n\nWhat do y'all think, am I the asshole??",

I think he may have missed a few days of work. Suddenly he became cold to me. I told him I wanted to talk to him last Friday, and he said he was too tired. I asked him if he was ok, and he said he just wanted to be alone when he's busy or else he hurts people. Didn't explain what he meant by that. So I decided not to text him for a few days. \n\nYesterday, I looked on Facebook and saw that I couldn't see anything on his profile. I texted him and told him I knew he was busy, but I needed to talk to him. No response, but it was marked read. Later that night, I wrote him a long text saying I know he's busy so I want to help him. I asked him how many days does he need to be alone. I told him I wanted to help him, but I need his help too. I need to hear from him often. I feel like he's mad at me, but I don't know why. His cold attitude is hurting me. \nRead, but no response.\n\nThis morning, I saw that he has now completely blocked me on Facebook. \nI texted him good morning, have a good day like I always did before earlier today. It's not marked as read.\nI sent him a snapchat asking why is he ignoring me. Not read yet.\n\nWhat did I do wrong? I feel like this is all my fault. Am I too clingy? \n\nDue to some past conversations and conflicts with him, I have a strong feeling that he is on the autistic spectrum. I've been professionally diagnosed with Asperger's, so relationships and solving conflict is so difficult for me.\n\nI'm so devastated, this is my first real relationship. I already mailed him his Christmas present last week. I put so much thought in it. I already feel so heartbroken.\n\nI just want to know what I did wrong. He won't talk to me, so I can't ask him.

    "selftext": "Background: My husband and I lived with his sister (we will call her Lisa) from June to October this year, while we transitioned from living in NY to living in WA. Lisa invited us to stay with her and her husband more than a year prior to us moving out here, and we assumed that meant we would be staying inside their house. When we arrived, they informed us that we would be staying in their front lawn in our bus that we converted into an RV. I was 35 weeks pregnant at the time. This became a huge ordeal and we eventually had a big blowout over it. We ended on what I thought was a positive note, agreeing to be more communicative and supportive of each other in the future. Through all of this, we have come to find that they are very reserved people and distrusting of others (not necessarily a negative, just a personality trait that is important to the story). My husband and I are the very opposite of that.\n\nStory: Recently, we moved about an hour away from Lisa. We moved most of our stuff out of their house but left a few baby things that we are very much in need of now. My husband has a full time job, and I am a stay at home mother. We have one car, which makes running errands during the day difficult (they know this). Two weeks ago, we tried to stop by Lisa's house to pick up our stuff. We asked her if it was okay if we came by, and then promptly forgot to go on our way home like we had planned. Baby brain is a very real thing. I texted her and apologized and said we'd let her know when we were in the area again to come pick up our stuff. She never responded. Cut to yesterday, my husband was in the area dropping off another family member that had spent the weekend with us. My husband called a few hours in advance asking if he could come by. Lisa said they weren't going to be home, but that she would call him back and let him know what was up. When she calls back, she says that they don't want him at the house when they aren't there, so he'd have to come back another time. This is the part that I'm not sure about. My husband is her brother. We lived with her for five months and have both been in her house unchaperoned before. He also lived with her on another occasion before we got married. They also know how difficult it is for us to arrange a time to get to their house. Am I the asshole for being annoyed that they wouldn't let him get our stuff? I know that it is her house, and she has the right to refuse entry to anyone she chooses, but all of this seems weird to me. I feel like an asshole, but I also feel like she's being petty because of our recent blowout. So, who is the asshole here?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for taking time to help me out. I don't want to be an asshole, and I was having a hard time seeing past my side of the situation. I appreciate the advice and will be going to her today to get my stuff and apologize for being weird.

    "selftext": "Hey people, \n\nSo a few months ago I started driving me, my (now) boyfriend and our friend (Lets call him Mike) to the gym. \nThis worked out for us all because I needed someone to help me with my workouts (Mike), Mike needed a ride to the gym and the other guy just wanted to come for the laugh. \n\nSo it's been working out, I learned a lot and he does his thing but recently I've noticed he takes a long time to do everything, he looks in the mirrors all the time asking if there's a difference every time we go and he gets pissy when I want to listen to music during cardio (for a constant rythm). \nSo one time Mike said he couldn't go and the other guy didn't want to go so I went alone and it was GLORIOUS. I got everything done in 1/3 of the time and I could listen to my music which helped with the workout. \n\nAfter Mike started coming again I started to resent the gym because I got a taste of what it was like going alone and so once or twice I would go without telling him. \nSo today I told him earlier that I wasn't going to the gym and last minute I decided to go because I felt fat and just wanted to sweat the carbs out so I got my stuff and went for about a half an hour of cardio. \n\nWhen I got back I get a message saying that he saw me when I got back home (he only lives a few doors down the road) and is a bit pissed. \n\nSo am I an asshole for going alone?\nI think I may be an asshole for lying and saying I wasn't going but at the time I genuinely wasn't going I just had a last minute fat shame moment and wanted to cry-run. \nAlso worth mentioning he gives me petrol money sometimes, but only like 10bucks every 3-6 months. \n\nTLDR: I was going gym with a friend for a few months. He takes too long and looks in the mirrors for most of workout. went without him because wanted a fast workout and he caught me and is pissed. ",

    "selftext": "So I'm getting a lot of backlash from this kids' friends and family via social media about this decision, for some reason. My friends either don't know or support my decision, but I'm fairly private about my goings on so not many of them know. I feel awful.\n\n\n\n\nSo my boyfriend comes to visit during finals week- not me, but his friend who was visiting the area who was once an exchange student at our school. The now-ex just graduated last year, and is living with his parents in Massachusetts.\nI asked him to please not see me at all- I was busy with finals. However, I found a break amidst my work, and allowed him to visit. Afterwards, I let him borrow my car to drive to see his friend five minutes away, telling him not to drive home tonight in the impending blizzard and to ESPECIALLY not drive home if he was drinking.\n\n\n\n\nHe drove home after drinking. \n\n\n\nAccording to the report, his BAC was a .14. The cops pulled him over because a) he forgot to turn on the headlights and b) he slid off the road (luckily without damaging the rental).\n\n\n\nHe came home at 5 that night, the night before all of my finals (most of them were smushed into the Monday of that week which sucked). He collapsed on the bed and threw the DWI papers onto me. I read them, and proceeded to tear him a new one. He started drunkenly insulting me and then drunkenly crying about his dashed hopes as a cop and how he \"wished the cop would've killed him\", so I held him until he went to sleep- there is a time and place for everything. I would not have dumped him at this juncture. I called the police, made sure that they didn't make note of the fact that he was driving my rental car, and went to bed.\n\n\n\nThree hours later, I woke up and got the car out of impound (245 bucks, cash- a lot for a college student). I told him beforehand that afterwards I would drive him to his friends' house because I \"didn't have time for this\". When I came back, he was gone. He left all of his things and it was still a snowy mess outside. He was still drunk when I left.\nI called him over and over, and he would occasionally answer and drunkenly tell me to leave him alone over the phone before hanging up. I spent a couple hours looking for him when I should've been perfecting my final projects (honestly, I left everything until the last minute as I didn't expect this debacle). So I proceeded to call his mother who called the police. She was terrified, and called me throughout the day. I called his friends to ask for their help, and they also called me throughout the day.\nLong story short, after a certain point I started calling hospitals and I found him in the emergency psych ward of the closest one- apparently he'd been wistfully staring over a local bridge for quite awhile before a cop pulled him off and checked him in.\n\n\n\nAlthough I was the one who made his family aware, looked for him, was the last one to see him etc, he didn't contact me immediately when he was released because he was \"embarrassed\". When I finally saw him to drop off his things, his friends were taking him to applebees to DRINK after all of this to \"cheer him up\". I ripped him new one for being selfish and jeopardizing my grades and scaring me and his mother. He just kept assuring me that he'd repay me for the impound (I assured him that I didn't care about the 245) and proceeded to go drink with his friends.\nI dumped him over text, definitely too soon. I have issues with anxiety and depression and struggle with school. I just learned that I have the required 2.0 semester average to not get kicked out, thank god, but at the time I was thinking \"fuck this shit I don't have time for this I need to take care of myself\". I also admittedly guilted him about how fucked I may be because of the time I lost (I got no sleep before my Tuesday final and bombed it- luckily my other grades got me through).\n\n\n\nSome of his family members contacted me via social media telling me that I \"antagonized and belittled\" his suicide attempt. His friends all think I'm a bitch (to be clear, I have my own friends and don't care). Personally, I feel as though I did everything I could to make sure he was safe at the time- more than anyone else- and sacrificed a lot to do it.\n\n\n\nI have experience with suicidality myself and have been with people that have attempted it- I just don't want that in my life. Moreover, it's not the fact that he did it, its the WAY he did it. If he wasn't trying to get attention from me, why would he make suicidal comments and leave when he knew I'd be right back? why wouldn't he tell me some excuse so that I wouldn't take the time to look for him? Why wouldn't he be thankful for what his mother and I did to make sure he was safe at the time?\n\n\n\nThe day after I let him sleep in my bed while I worked on finals. I was as nice as I possibly could be, IMO. What do you guys think?",

I didn't realize how crowded it would be when I pulled in to just grab a coffee but, as I was about to drive out, I found a spot really close to the coffee shop so I parked and ran inside.\n\n  When I came back out, this lady saw me going to my car so she pulled up and put on her signal light to indicate that she was going to take my spot.\n\nAs I was backing out, however, this cute old lady came around the corner, approaching from the opposite side as the lady who was waiting.  She seemed like she was the type of person that every boy scout would dream about walking across the street.  \n\n  So what I did was I backed out in such a way that I blocked the person waiting while waving the old lady into the stall.  \n\n  Unfortunately, the granny took forever to park her enormous '80s sedan and I had to sit there the whole time, trying to avoid eye contact with the other lady (while she mouthed the word \"asshole\" over and over).  Further, this all happened just two spots in from the main thoroughfare and the old lady's glacial parking job created a traffic jam which affected quite a few people and delayed me so that I just had to sit there and endure the death-glare from the person that I blocked for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nEdit: posted this 45 min ago, right when I got back from the mall.

    "selftext": "So we live in the UK, my wife moved here from the United States in July 2015. This means that her US driving license in the UK is no longer valid to legally drive with. We're currently waiting on her new, UK one but then we'll need to wait for a theory test, then practical. In my area we're looking at about 5 months until she has a license.\n\nI only passed my test and got a car in July. At the time we both worked in the same office with matching schedules so I drove us both to and from work every day. In September I changed jobs and now I either work from home, commute by train into London (leaving 2 hours before she starts and getting home about 2 hours after she finishes), or I drive into the office, dropping her at hers along the way. \n\nThis is where it gets to the problem. If I'm working from home, she expects me to drive her to the office and pick her up. It's not a long distance, maybe 3 miles each way if that. But the traffic here is atrocious. If I drive her to work to get in at 8, I'm home at 8:30 best case and in one scenario not until 0945 - after leaving the house at 0740. I don't have any set working schedule and I can catch up on work quickly when I get back, but that's a long time to be sat stuck in traffic in the morning.\n\nThe main issue I have is that the offices where she works have a free shuttle bus service which although crowded and uncomfortable, is a 5 minute walk from our flat and runs every 10 - 15 minutes. Although it's not as convenient as being in a car with her husband and it's a 5 min walk and short wait in the cold, I feel it's fair for her to take that when I am working from home. \n\nI also, unless I have a call, always pick her up at 4pm when I'm home. And again, when I drive to work I leave early enough to drop her off and then head out of the office at 1545 so I can pick her up too.\n\nI thought I was completely in the right but a mutual friend who works with her (I used to work at the same place) told me I was being an asshole about it. \n\nI think I've covered everything and been fair, just looking for an impartial opinion on this.",

    "selftext": "So this happened today and I feel pretty bad about it. I need to know if I'm the asshole in this situation. \n\nI work reception in an office building that does confidential work for our clients and therefore has certain security measures in place for visitors. The front door is always locked to the public so to get inside you have to use a phone by the door, press 0, then I answer. You state your name/company and who you're here to see, then I can press a button that unlocks the door for you. \n\nToday I was at my desk when I heard knocking at the door. I initially didn't answer and waited for them to see the sign about calling in, but after 5 minutes of this person's pounding I decided to just get up and see who was there. (Not the smartest move, but sometimes our clients get confused or people get lost etc.)\n\nI opened the door a crack and immediately the man on the other side pulled the door all the way open and stepped inside, saying that he was here for a delivery. We have two different shipping/receiving areas for different materials, so I asked him what he was delivering. He said he didn't know. So I asked him what company he was delivering for. Again he said he didn't know. I told him he would need to see one of our shippers on either side of the building but I didn't know which one to direct him to if he didn't know what he was delivering.\n\nHere's where it started getting weird to me..\n\nNext he asked me if I had a coat and if I would just put my coat on him and go walk with him. I told him no I can't do that, but he kept insisting. If I would only just get my coat and walk with him it would be so wonderful. (Keep in mind it's dark out, and our building is in an industrial area in not the best part of town. Not the kind of place I would want to be walking around alone with a strange man.) He started saying how he could tell I had a good heart and he just wanted me to walk with him. At this point I notice that he's not even carrying a package, so it's even more odd that he would want to walk to the shipping area. I'm feeling pretty uncomfortable at this point, then he starts going on a weird rant about how I remind him of \"that girl in silence of the lambs\". Which freaks me out even more. Eventually I was able to convince him to go around the building on his own to one of our shipping areas and he leaves. \n\nI immediately told my boss because the whole thing seemed really fishy, and my boss told me he would handle it. At the end of the day my boss told me that he found out what company the guy was working for and called his boss to complain about the incident. He let them know that we didn't want this guy to come back or else we would find a different carrier. \n\nWell it turns out it was his first day on the job, and he was picking up a package not delivering (hence why he wasn't carrying anything), and the company decided to fire him rather than work around him being banned from working with our business. \n\nNow that I know that he was just starting out, I can understand why he might have wanted me to show him where he was supposed to go. And looking back I can see how he may have just been trying to be friendly and it came off the wrong way. But in the moment I genuinely did feel uncomfortable and a little freaked out. \n\nAm I the asshole here for getting him fired? Or was this his fault for being unprofessional and inappropriate?\n\nTl;dr: a delivery guy came to my work and said some things that made me feel uncomfortable. I complained to my boss, who then complained to his, then he got fired. I found out later that it was his first day on the job and feel as if I overreacted and cost him his job for no reason. ",

She claimed that me and the other roommate don't clean up the common room and kitchen at all. The fact is however, that all of the dirty dishes and garbage in the common room and kitchen is hers. She has always been like that but relied on roommate 3 to clean up after her. Roommate 3 is now gone, which meant that the kitchen became just too dirty. As I said, at one point she would have a party in the evening so wanted the house to be clean and went completely mad when we didn't want to help her. \n\nAfter that outburst (that at least 30 people in surrounding houses   could have heard) she cleaned up most of the kitchen on her own and when I came back later that evening, I cleaned up some of the leftovers so there could be a fresh start. I thought that would be the end of it, because surely she wouldn't make a mess all on her own again after that outburst. Well, she did. Me and the other roommate were extra careful not to forget to wash any of our own dishes, but roommate 1 just fucked up the whole kitchen and common room again within a week. The table was filled with empty bottles and cans, the kitchen sink was clogged (I think on purpose) and the half empty glasses of juice became moldy. Even the disgusting clogged sink became covered with mold because of unfinished food and not washed dishes in the sink. She did not clean it up, but she left for 2 weeks on a vacation. When I confronted her on facebook, she told me that she doesn't care. \n\nI think it's clear that she is an asshole in this situation. The question is however, am I an asshole for my response? I grew sick of her and wanted a nice and clean common room while she was gone, so I unclogged the sink and put all the dirty dishes, bowls of dirty moldy water and empty cans/bottles in her bathroom. Now, her bathroom was already disgusting before I did that, but now it is covered with a lot of dirty dishes and garbage, it's absolutely awful in there. The mold is also not turning the bathroom in a nice place right now and everything will be in there for 2 weeks. I refuse to clean her shit up and let the common room be so dirty because of her, but was this whole 'turning the bathroom into a dangerously disgusting place' a dick move?

    "selftext": "My wife (26f) and I (28m) are watching Big Bang Theory together every night after my daughter (2yo) goes to bed. Today after work my wife got sick. She asked me to sing 'Soft Kitty' to her. Initially I thought she was joking. When she asked again I told her I was uncomfortable singing - which isn't true. If she'd asked me to sing almost any other song, I would have. But when she asked me to sing 'Soft Kitty', I felt very angry. The guys over at /r/relationship_advice helped me figure the next part out.\n\nI felt angry because I have a strong dislike for the Sheldon character in Big Bang Theory. For me, the show is a sitcom survival show of how Leonard pursues happiness and overcomes the obstacle of Sheldon. The instances where Sheldon asks someone to sing Soft Kitty - from my interpretation - highlight the manipulative, arrogant behavior of his superiority complex. The way he demands perfection in delivery of the song while ill and punishes imperfect performance with \"from the top\"  demands strip any positive reflection of his character and make me feel belittled in my connection with the character singing.\n\nMy wife had also asked if I would sit with her and play with her hair, watch some more Big Bang Theory with her, and go get her a Sprite. I told her I absolutely would be happy to. But once I refused to sing soft kitty, I got \"just go do whatever you want to\". \n\nSo I made the bed, finished laundry, and finished dishes. I went outside for a smoke and came back in. When she didn't want any of the things we had talked about, I offered her a foot rub. She declined and went to bed. .. we rarely go to bed one at a time.\n\n5 days ago, my wife started wrapping presents. She forgot to get tags, and I suggested using 2\"x3\" prices of a different patterned wrapping paper folded in half as little tags. She decided to cut out cardboard, paint them with glue, and press glitter onto them. They look great, but the 30-minutes-at-a-time mess has been in our living room for 5 days.\n\n4 days ago my in-laws informed us that since my  brother-in-law(33m) and his wife are coming to town, we would do Christmas at our house instead of theirs. Our house is a wreck from the effects on our routine of 2 family Christmases last weekend. I have spent 4 hours each night cleaning. My brother (24m) even came over the first two nights to help entertain my daughter. My wife spent the first two nights shopping and bringing things from storage into the living room, and the last two nights starting three different decoration and gift projects involving glitter in the living room.\n\nWe may have to cancel plans altogether if my wife doesn't get better tonight, but I'm hurt because it seems that in general I catch the crap for not doing enough (that conversation usually starts with \"would you stop and listen to me\" WHILE I'm doing dishes). But when I say, \"hey honey, what do you need to finish your projects so we can clean the living room,\" its met with remarks akin to \"if you're going to be so negative, just go do something else\".\n\nYesterday in the parking lot after work, I asked my wife what was wrong because she seemed distressed. She wound up venting a long list of how I was being negative and pushy, and she wanted me to tell her immediately if I wanted a divorce. I don't want a divorce, and I told her so. I just said \"I hear what you're saying, thank you for telling me how you feel.\"\n\nAfter my wife went to bed tonight, I posted on /r/relationship_advice. Then I cleaned the house, including moving her projects to the office (our hoarder closet). I rearranged the office and set up her projects so she would have room to go in there tomorrow and finish... If she wants to and feels well enough.\n\nI don't know, guys. I feel justified in not wanting to sing the song because of my emotional reaction to it. But just by the fact that I had an emotional reaction to it, I feel like a dick. I'm hoping an apology and an explanation will help. But I'm afraid it wont be heard. My wife is a very \"'sorry' is useless\" kind of woman.\n\nEdit: pronouns/words for clarity\n\nAdded: Link below to first post on same topic. Thanks for the help over there, everyone.\n\nAm I wrong? Didn't want to sing 'Soft Kitty' to my sick wife.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5k1b5q/am_i_wrong_didnt_want_to_sing_soft_kitty_to_my/",

John and Ma don't really get along much but she trusts him at home.\n\n\n**My Side:**\n     Around 4PM John calls and says he'll be done with work around 7 and that he finally got paid. Around 8 Ma asks me to call him because she has to go to a Christmas party and doesn't want to leave me alone because a string of robberies have occurred nearby. John says he'll be back before 9 since he's hanging out with our cousin Wally(26). I call him at 10 because he still wasn't back, he claims he's still in a magic match but that he's almost finished. At 11:30 I hear knocking on the front door and I see that John's car is in the driveway so I decide to make him wait a few minutes as punishment. 10 minutes later I go to the front door and open it to find John and Wally on the porch. That's when I slammed the door shut in anger and sent them a message to wait for Ma to come back if they wanted to go inside. They waited for a bit then drove off.\n\n   I don't like Wally very much because he encourages John's use of synthetic marijuana and lies about it. I'm pretty goddamn sure they were smoking and lost track of the time. I *would have* let John in if Wally wasn't there, Wally isn't even allowed to stay over for the night so either he *was* going to stay over or they were just passing through. \n\n**John's side:**\n     He was working 4 days straight in misty weather for our asshole uncle. After all that he got paid around $300  and went to the local comic shop to buy the new Commander deck. Then John went to Wally's place because all of John's decks were there and he wanted to replace some cards with the ones he bought. He got the call around 8 that he needs to go back home but he's tired from all the work and wants to test out the new deck against someone who actively plays since Jessica no longer plays magic. Commander games go on for hours, especially when you're testing out new cards and then John got the call at 10:30. He and Wally wrap up the game and drive home but once they get there around 11:15 Jessica doesn't open the door. They knock on the front door and windows until the door finally opens but as soon as it does it gets slammed shut. Jessica just sends them a text telling them to wait for Ma. Once the rain got heavy they leave in the truck.\n\n**tldr**: I locked out my older bro because he was possibly high and stayed out far longer than he was supposed to.\n\nEdit: I should mention that I'm currently injured to the point where I can barely walk and John moved in to be my caretaker during the evening.\nOur mother has an order of protection against Wally which is why he's not allowed on the property.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: On Christmas Eve I intervened because I was tired of watching my sisters boyfriend pick on a friend of ours, and because he was causing a mess. What transpired was a conflagration in an otherwise very calm and functional household that seems to have ruined Christmas and my sister probably wont talk to myself or my mom for a considerable length of time. In the cold light of day I feel like I should have just let it go, but I have also learned other things that make me think someone needed to say something.\n\n(Quotes are loose, but Ive tried not to quote where I dont think I can accurately recreate the sentiment)\n\nSo this is a evening to morning affair. Late last night, Christmas Eve, the family and friends are all hanging out at my moms house. Im in from out of town with my girlfriend and out dog, but everyone else lives in the immediate vicinity of my moms place. My sisters boyfriend, who I get along with just fine, has been getting more drunk and a little rowdy. I have been cleaning up, removing cans, etc and trying to get people to move downstairs because they are loud and my mom is asleep. He had just spilled a beer on my moms rug by playing around with the dog, which I had just cleaned up. It was definitely an accident, but could have been avoided. He has been teasing/antagonizing a family friend who rents a room in my moms basement. While trying to hit the family friend in the nuts, he causes the friend to bump into a table and spill another beer on the carpet. Again, its just horseplay and given that everyones been drinking a little bit Im annoyed, but not angry.\n\nOur friend goes to try and clean up the beer, and while doing so my sisters boyfriend tries to hit him in the nuts again. At this point I get pretty pissed off, because hes been antagonizing this guy all night and generally acting like a teenager, and is now actively preventing things from getting cleaned up. I stand up and get between to two of them and shout that they need to stop acting like children and clean up after themselves. They boyfriend cuts me off and asks \"Are you being serious right now?\" Unfortunately I didn't react well to this, because I was definitely serious, so I yell louder, which is definitely the wrong thing to do.\n\nMy sisters boyfriend doesn't take this lightly and starts to get aggressive. I yell at him again, that I am very serious and he needs to stop playing around and clean up after himself if hes going to spill shit. At this point he starts yelling at me about how I can't talk to him like that and how he was just messing around. This is where I start to think I reacted poorly. He starts giving me the Bro Death Glare. Im not interested in this becoming violent, and I know he has something of a history of getting aggressive and getting in fights when hes drunk, so I take a seat while other people try to de-escalate. My sister gets in the way and tries to get him to calm down, but he continues to stare me down and tell me how much of an asshole I'm being.\nMy mom emerges at this point and starts yelling at people for being assholes when shes trying to go to bed. My mom and my sister start yelling at each other, and her boyfriend starts telling me to be a man and how we need to be alone to \"work this out\". \n\nMy girlfriend, at this point convinced that this guy is going to try and fight me because he keeps trying to get around his girlfriend and towards me, panics and calls the cops. At the time I thought this was a really, really, bad idea, but I have since learned that the boyfriend has a former conviction for battery, so maybe not so much. She tells everyone she did this and that they need to calm down, which causes my sister to lose her shit and start screaming at everyone, presumably because she knew about the former conviction. Again, understandable with context. A couple of other people wisely leave at this point. Eventually everyone leaves the room except for me, still seated and trying not to make things worse than I already did, and the boyfriend who asks me if I want a beer and want to talk about this. I appreciated this, but knew the police would be there any minute. I say that I dont because Im going to have to talk to the cops in a few minutes. The cops show up just a little bit later. In the time between when my girlfriend said she called the cops and when they showed up he calmed down significantly, but then did an about face when they left, so I think maybe he was concerned I would say something incriminating about him.\n\nI let the cops inside and explain what happened, and explain that its mostly my fault for yelling at the guy, they take the boyfriend outside to get his side of the story. The cops take some information from a few people, but the boyfriend refuses to tell them anything besides his name. They ask my sister if she can talk to her boyfriend about cooperating a little more, at which point she starts yelling at the police about how much bullshit this is. This was pretty surprising to me, but I guess in light of his previous conviction for beating someone up Im not that surprised. They roll their eyes, resolve that there is no crime, and take off. This is the part of the story that I should also file under \"why being white is really easy\".\n\nThey leave and everyone starts yelling at each other again, except for me who just wants this to be over. My sister and her boyfriend and a few other people head downstairs and I start cleaning up the house. While cleaning I can hear my sister and her boyfriend downstairs talking about how I'm a \"drunk piece of shit\" and how my girlfriend is a \"crazy psycho bitch\". Let me re-iterate that I have had very little to drink during all this and I'm pretty sober. I have been too drunk on holidays in the past, so I can definitely see them assuming I was wasted. My girlfriend is also a very quiet and reserved person, and called the police purely out of concern for everyones safety. At this point Im probably the most sober person in the house, so that irks me a bit, but my girlfriend can also hear them and she starts to feel unsafe so we start having to plan for how to leave in the morning so everyone can go on with their Christmas.\n\nEventually, I go downstairs to ask them if they can at least quiet down. They're currently polishing off another bottle of whiskey. I tell them that I don't really care if they want to talk shit, but that its disrespectful to my mom how loud they're being and I would also prefer not to have to listen to it while cleaning up their empties. They start yelling at me again about how much of an asshole I am, boyfriend gets in my face again, and I walk away. To his credit he doesn't hit me or throw anything at me when Im turned around. Anyway, I make it back upstairs and finish up cleaning.\n\nAfter I get all the food put away and get ready to go to bed I can still hear them making fun of me and my girlfriend. I go down one more time and as Im going down the stairs I can hear them joking about me coming down again. I tell them that I just want to say one thing, which is \"I'm sorry about what happened, but you guys really need to calm down and keep it quiet because its 2AM.\" I get about 2 words in (the important ones, I would think) before I get cut off and they start telling me that this is all my fault. I try to get the boyfriend to stop talking so I can finish, which he takes as condescending. I \"sshed\" him, which he didnt take well, and I understand that.\n\nEventually I get a chance to talk again and decide to switch my strategy. I own the house with my mom, and I'm the only one of the three kids on the deed and the mortgage, I say, \"Look, I'm the co-owner of this house and Im within my rights to call the police back here and have you removed. I don't want to do that so please just cut it out.\" This obviously comes off as a threat, but I honestly didnt know if I could go to sleep safely with him in the house given how pissed he was at me. The boyfriend starts yelling at me again about how \"Im not going to do shit\" and how we should \"go outside\". I walk away again, to which he starts yelling about how Im a fucking asshole and dont want to work shit out like a man. I give him the finger and head upstairs to go to bed. I probably should not have done this, and threatening to call the police probably made it a lot worse.\n\nGiven that its nearly 3 AM at this point my girlfriend and I are kind of out of luck with regards to finding a place to stay. I get her to calm down enough to agree to at least stay until the morning and we can get up and find a hotel then. Its a little harder since we have our dog with us, who is small, but still limits our options. After a few hours of fitful sleep I get up when I hear my mom in the kitchen and explain to her that my girlfriend and I need to leave because we clearly fucked things up and it will be much easier for everyone if we're not around. Also, I can't imagine my sister and her boyfriend being willing to leave on their own accord. Basically I think us leaving is the best option for everyones egos.\n\nI explained this to my mom at about 830 this morning, not wanting to make things any worse but knowing that it will be easier for myself and my girlfriend, who live in a different state, to just get out of the way. My mom thinks this is bullshit and thinks the whole thing is the boyfriends fault, because he apparently does shit like this pretty frequently. She goes to their bedroom door and asks them \"what [their] plan is\". The boyfriend immediately starts yelling at my mom and tells her to fuck off, yelling about how she should \"talk to her fucking son\" instead. My sister also starts yelling. My mom is not exactly a soft woman and tells them that if they're going to act like that then they need to get the fuck out. So they took off while saying things like \"Merry fucking Christmas, dont think there will be a next time\".\n\nMy brother comes over about an hour later, he had left before the whole conflagration the previous night. He says that this is pretty fucking typical of the boyfriend when hes drinking as he spends a lot more time with him than I do. Basically everyones on edge and my sister isnt here for Christmas, and it really looks like its all my fault for shouting at the guy in the first place. Given that I live out of town, Im sure that I will be portrayed to all our family friends as the one who was drunk and the one who started the fight, and my girlfriend will be portrayed as a crazy fucking person.\n\nDetails I didnt have at the time: This guy has gotten into heated arguments with other friends of the family who are pretty calm dudes, probably calmer than me. Also, come to find out that the dude beat someone up in a bar several years ago and had the conviction expunged recently, which maybe explains why he and my sister were so pissed about the cops being there.\n\nSo basically my question is am I the asshole? I feel like I should have just ignored what was happening and moved on, and everyone would have been okay today. Instead I got in the way and started yelling at this guy, and now my sister missed Christmas day with the family and definitely wont want to talk to myself or my mother any time soon. Knowing what I know now about how often stuff this guy is drunk/angry and how he has a history of violence I feel a bit vindicated in stepping in, because what he was doing to our friend definitely looked like bullying, but I can't shake the feeling that by stepping in and yelling at him, which was the flame to the gasoline for everything else, that I fucked up Christmas for everyone else. Thoughts?\n\n*Edited a few times for fairness",

My immediate reaction was to donate some from my summer job to charity, but I only did that to not feel so guilty, not out of goodwill. I do a few other things that could be regarded as charitable, but rarely out of goodwill (for example, I'm a girl scout and am doing quite a bit of volunteer work there, but that is only to make my college application more impressive.)\n\n~~Everyone has an obligation to~~ *It is important to me that I* make the world a better place, and I am a position where I can do that fairly easily.

    "selftext": "So, I like Secret Santa.\n\nI don't really care what I get, but I like getting gifts for people.  I like trying to figure out what their interests are, find something that I think they'd really enjoy, something they wouldn't get for themselves but would want and/or appreciate.\n\nSo, our school did Secret Santa and I got a guy I know.  I was excited because I knew *exactly* what to get him.  He and I share some mutual interests so I went and got him something I knew he'd appreciate.\n\nWell, he didn't show up to the Secret Santa event, but that's okay - he was busy and the presents are just left under the tree in the lounge so I figured he'd pick it up at some point.\n\nExcept that he didn't.  And people tried to contact him and tell him to get his gift, but he's just ignoring everyone's texts.  The ignoring thing isn't new - he does that a lot, but I usually give him the benefit of the doubt because some people are bad at communicating.  I know I can be bad at communicating sometimes.\n\nSo, it's been a few days and if the leftover presents aren't picked up then the cleaning staff is planning on throwing them away.  The only other present left behind is one that was handed in without a name (???).  I'm really kind of put out because I was excited to get this gift for him and I put time and effort into choosing the right one - and he never even bothered to pick it up.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not planning on confronting him or anything.  I considered bringing the present to him or just leaving it outside his door, but would that make me seem passive aggressive?  I don't want the cleaning crew to just throw it in the trash.  Should I pick it up?\n\nBasically - am I being unreasonable about this?  I know that in the long run, it's not a big deal.  I'm just a little miffed, I guess.",

    "selftext": "My family is travelling for Christmas and staying with a really lovely Canadian family in Quebec. We went out to a nice French restaurant for lunch on Boxing Day, which had a really swank looking bar attached. The restaurant had a deal where you pay 20 bucks and get a starter, main, dessert and a beer, and add extra for more expensive choices, which everyone chose and my dad was paying for everyone.\n\nI really love whiskey, and on the way in I noticed the bar had a bourbon that I really like and was selling it in Manhattans (a simple cocktail with whiskey and vermouth) for dirt cheap. So after I finished my meal-included beer, I went over to the bar to buy one.\n\nWhen I brought it back to my table, the Canadian family didn't even notice, but both my parents glared at me. Dad said \"Where's everyone else's?\". I was really confused, I thought maybe he'd thought I put it on his bill without asking so I explained that it's ok I paid for this myself.\n\nHaving grabbed the attention of the whole table, he then continued \"It's incredibly rude to get a drink like that\" while my mother nodded I'm ashamed agreement.\n\nI was lost for words, and so was the Canadian family. It was so embarrassing, all I wanted to do was enjoy this drink at Christmas and my own parents humiliated me, an adult man, in public and in front of our hosts. I don't understand, surely there's irony in how rude it is to blatantly call someone out at the dinner table.\n\nThis has been weighing on me for a few days and making it hard to enjoy the trip, everything my parents say feels antagonistic.

We hike together fairly often but this was our first one in a while. \n\nSo last hike (a year ago almost) my friend struggled with foot pain which she said she got every hike. She struggled on the last hike and I told her she needed to go to a physio or podiatrist because she probably needed insoles. \n\nSo fast forward to this hike, she suggested it, I put no pressure on her and I sunk about 700 dollars into the trip. 4 days in her feet are really hurting and she says she can't go on so we cut it short and she also felt she was struggling fitness wise. \n\nI feel bad that she's in pain but I'm just frustrated that 1) she didn't bother to do anything about this recurring issue and 2) she did absolutely no training whatsoever to prepare herself. And she  kept complaining about how I was going too fast and that she felt inferior because of her fitness. \n\nThe thing is I also have recurring issues and I've gone to the physio trying to correct it. I just feel like she let me down and I wouldn't be upset if it was a new injury etc but the fact that she's had this issue before and didn't do anything about it upsets me. I've tried to get her going on some practice hikes and walks but she always turned me down. \n\nSo am I the asshole?",

There was about three hours between the time my youngest daughter's team and my oldest daughter's team would go on, so we walked around the convention center and got some food to kill time.\n\nWhile we were sitting on the bleachers eating our food, a man came up to us and told us that a girl on his dance team had just lost her mother in an accident two months ago, and that I looked like her to a tee. He showed me a picture on his phone, and I do have to admit I look a lot like this woman. He told me that she had seen me multiple times throughout the day and each time got upset because she thought I was her mom. I didn't really know what to say so I just said 'that's terrible, I'm so sorry for her loss'.\n\nThen he said that as 'one dance parent to another' he would appreciate it if I would leave, because my presence was too upsetting to the girl on his team and he wanted to be sensitive to her feelings. I was taken aback and just told him that I was waiting for my 12-year-old's team to go on and I couldn't just leave because then no one would be supervising my 9-year-old. He shrugged his shoulders and said 'I hoped you would do the right thing, I suppose I'll have to go talk to the event organizers'.\n\nI was still in shock and my oldest daughter told me we should tell her coach what happened, so we did, because my daughter thought maybe he was trying to somehow sabotage her team? We pointed him out and my daughter's coach said he wasn't the coach of a team they were competing against and not to worry about it, if anyone said anything else he'd deal with them.\n\nNo 'event organizer' ever came up and asked me to leave, but word got around within the parents of our team, and most parents thought the guy was way out of line but a couple have suggested that maybe I should have just stayed out of the way so the girl on the other team wouldn't have to see me, and that it would have been kinder to do so. A few parents even said that they wouldn't have minded watching my 9-year-old while I waited out in the car. \n\nI'm just wondering if I was insensitive to this girl in any way, or if that guy's request was out of line. I thought it was, but if the girl just lost her mom then I wouldn't want to be insensitive. We also might be seeing them again because a lot of teams go to the same competitions multiple times.

    "selftext": "Okay.  Background info.\n\nI'm 22F.  I was friends for a while with this guy who's in his early forties.  I know, I know.  He started talking to me while I was in high school.  I didn't want to judge a book by its cover, even though my dad repeatedly warned me about him.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI know this guy likes to date young girls, but he never expressed any interest in me.  He always told me he looked at me like a friend and I said the same.  Because I DID see him like a friend and nothing more.  Sometimes he and I would make dumb sex jokes, but he does that with all his friends, and I do that with all of mine.  It was clear to me they were nothing but jokes, especially considering I had a bf at the time and he was way hung up on his ex of like... four years now?  Almost five?\n\nTo continue.\n\nOnce my long-term boyfriend and I broke up, he immediately started acting different.  Getting mad if I \"talked to guys my own age,\" that kind of stuff.  Getting mad if I didn't text him every day. Getting really possessive.  I asked him if he liked me, he said no.  He kept getting more aggressive in his behavior, and eventually I asked him again and he admitted that he did.  When I explained that I didn't have feelings for him like that, he told me I was \"lying to myself about my feelings\" and that he'd \"never been wrong about a girl liking him before.\"\n\nOkay.  Well, he wanted to remain friends but needed some space.  Okay.  I gave him some space, didn't text him every day.  And then he went off on me with a passive-aggressive text about how I wasn't being a good friend because I wasn't talking to him enough.\n\nI couldn't handle it anymore so I decided to cut contact.  I figured that eventually he'd calm down and maybe we could talk things out, but clearly talking hadn't worked at that point so I might as well wait.  I blocked him on Facebook and my phone because he was pretty obsessive with the way he contacted his ex and I didn't want him to do that to me.\n\nWhen he figured out I'd blocked him, he started following me around online on sites that didn't have a blocking function.  Making fun of my previous suicide attempt on public forums.  He's also been making sexual comments about me, especially about my breasts.\n\nToday he and I finally had a blowup fight.  He was harassing me publicly - again - so I told him he needed to leave me alone.  See, nobody on this site knew that he had confessed to me, as he asked me not to tell anyone.  The only people who knew were people close to me that I'd told.  And, as I know now, the people he told.  I told him publicly that if he didn't leave me alone, I'd make the details of our last few conversations public.\n\nHe blew up and started making comments about how I'd led him on, forced him to confess even though he only liked me because he was depressed and he was already getting over it at the time, how I'd ended our friendship in a shxtty way and how he makes fun of everyone so I wasn't allowed to be mad that he was making fun of me.\n\nThe majority of the site came to support me - many of them sent me private messages.  About three or four girls have had to leave the site because of his behavior towards them.  One girl defended him, but that's about it.  I assume he's never made advances at her because, as he told me, he only dates girls that are basically in high school/college.\n\nI've been talking to his ex and getting her side of the story about the breakup.  How he posted her nudes online for revenge and sent them to her friends, how he got multiple phone numbers when she blocked his, how he went to her home town to force her to speak with him after she blocked him, how they had sex when she was underage.  All that stuff.\n\nTo be honest, I'm feeling pretty good about how I handled things, if a bit stressed.  He complained that I didn't talk to him privately - however, he's really manipulative and he can be really, really nasty when confronted, and I didn't feel comfortable opening the avenue for him to talk to me personally.  I felt like this was a fair response to him not leaving me alone.\n\nAm I crazy?  Am I a prick for telling him his behavior is inappropriate and he needs to leave me alone?\n\nEither way, thanks for listening.  I'm glad I stood up for myself, but I'm feeling stressed and anxious about the whole thing.",

Our dorm is kind of unique because we each have our own room. Hers is behind mine so she has to walk through my room to get out. \n\nSo my roommate insists she is always too hot and will keep her window open with the fan blowing in the winter every day. We have a draft protector under the door but it still makes my room much colder, under the recommended temperatures the RA told me. I use a space heater and a heated blanket but it's still so cold and all my friends feel uncomfortable in my room. \n\nI asked the RA if maintenance could come and check my vents and maybe turn up the heat in my room. My roommate is pissed at me for asking and said she didn't want them to come if turning the heat on in my room meant it would be turned on in hers (it does). She said I can live in the cold, but she can't sleep if it's too hot in her room. Am I the asshole for wanting the heat turned up? ",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend used to be a pro-refugee liberal before the refugee crisis and terrorist attacks happened. Especially the Paris terrorist attack in November 2015 got to him because as he said it, \"Paris/France is a symbol of our values and culture\" and those people were attacking just that. Adding to that the attacks that happened since then, he's become really critical of Islam. I don't think there's anything wrong with being critical, but he's becoming obsessed with it it seems. We're arguing pretty much daily about Islam and refugees. He doesn't like how I don't have a strong black or white opinion on this issue. I do think that there's a problem with Islamic culture, but that doesn't mean we can deny Muslims refuge in our country. We can't look inside their heads, so we must assume the best intentions. And we can't let ourselves become biased because even if a stereotype is true 70% of the time, it's still racist (or xenophobic or whatever) to project this stereotype onto some individual.\n\nI'm rambling. What I'm trying to say is that we're arguing daily about this shit. It always happens the same way: he shows me some article about a refugee doing something criminal, acts amused, says things like \"thanks Merkel\", \"religion of peace\", or \"they're all highly qualified doctors and professors right there!\". He knows this rhetoric pisses me the fuck off, so then I'm angry, we start arguing until I leave the room because I'm too pissed. Then sometimes he comes into my room a few hours later, shows me another damn article and tries to argue again. I know he does it to change my view about Islam, but at this point I don't even want to talk to him about this stuff at all anymore. Am I being unreasonable/the asshole here?",

    "selftext": "I'll try to keep this as short and unbiased as possible, though there is a lot of negative history between those involved and myself. I'll put a Tl;dr at the end.\n\n  My best friend (we'll call him Jared), myself, and a friend of ours (lets call him Carl) all lived in a 3br condo. For the first few months that Carl was living with Jared and me, he slept in the living room (waiting for the remaining tenant from the lease before ours to move out).  Once said tenant moved out, Carl moved into a bedroom.  Fast forward about 5 months.  Jared tells me that his mother is having trouble paying her rent (which isn't uncommon, she's been financially irresponsible for as long as I can remember), and he wants to move her and his little brother into the condo.  He asks if, with enough time, Carl and I would be okay moving out and finding another place.  I am absolutely fine with this, as Jared and his family have let me rent a room from them when I was much younger and got kicked out of my parents house.  I told him it wasn't as issue, and Carl and I began entertaining the idea of finding another place to live.  \n  A few weeks later, Jared let me know that he had talked to the landlord, and the landlord was not okay with Jared moving his family in and Carl and I moving out. Upon hearing this news, Jared informed me that he would be moving out of the condo and into an apartment with his mother and brother.  About 2 weeks later, on a Friday, Jared lets me know, in passing, that his mother and brother will be moving into our living room this weekend. I was a little taken back by the abruptness of it all, but I gathered my composure and asked Jared, \"For how long?\". Jared just shrugs his shoulders and tells me, \"I don't know\", and carries on with what he was doing. \n  It is discussed between Jared and Carl and I that his mother would not be paying rent, but instead she would be paying for the internet bill (no more than $50/mo I would imagine).  I wasn't too fond of the idea, but if I were to voice that opinion I'd be considered an asshole by Jared, as his mother is \"moving in so she can save money to find her own place\".  So, Jared's mother and little brother move in.  And having lived with his mother before, I knew how unclean and disorganized of a person she is. I'm talking old dirty dishes piled up for a month, dogs peeing/pooping in the house and it not getting cleaned up, trash littered all throughout the house, not cleaning up after herself, etc.  I would also consider her to be an enabler, and a bit of a hoarder, though I don't really know if that's relevant to this story.  About 2 months go by, and our landlord wants us to start paying utilities (he paid them prior).  I tell Jared that I think that we should split the utilities 5 ways since there's 5 people living there (Myself, Jared, Carl, Jared's little brother [age 14], and Jared's mother).  This greatly upsets Jared, and he tells me I'm an asshole for wanting to charge his 14 year old brother utilities.  I explain to him that whether he lived in our condo or in an apartment with just he and his mother like before, his mother was responsible for paying his utility usage.  Just because he's not old enough to pay the utilities himself, doesn't mean that he doesn't use them.  He plays video games, showers, uses the A/C, etc all of which require electricity, water, and gas.  I ultimately decided that splitting them 4 ways was the only way to keep negligible amount of peace in the house, so that's what we ended up doing.  \n  I still feel like the utilities should have been split 5 ways, and I tried asking family for unbiased opinions but they sided with me and I'm not sure if it's just because we're all so like-minded or if I'm really not the asshole.  For what it's worth, we have all gone our separate ways and Jared and I have not spoken since the conversation of the utilities (though his mother and I were cordial whilst living together).  It's extremely awkward living in a 1,200 sq. ft. condo with someone and not speaking to them for 10 months.  This may as well be unrelated to *my* situation, but Jared and his family still owe the landlord about $2,500 from not having paid their rent every month. Carl and I now live with the landlord at his home and have remained friends.  There is literally sooo much more that goes into this story that I feel would help my case, but I want to keep it as concise as possible.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some things.\n\nTl;dr: Friend moves Mom and little brother into our living room. I want to split the utilities 5 ways since there's 5 people living there and the mom doesn't pay rent.  Am I the asshole?\n\n  ",

    "selftext": "So today (Sunday), was an optional office lunch party, where the theme was that everyone would wear casual superhero T-shirts. This event would be followed by a mandatory staff meeting of my department. I don't own any superhero shirts, so I didn't think I would go, but on Wednesday, I heard the manager talking to someone else about his impressive collection of superhero shirts. I was intrigued, and asked him nicely then and there if he was willing to lend me one of his shirts, since we took the same size. He said he was happy too, and we agreed that he would bring it on the day of, I would wear it over top of the shirt I came in for a few hours, and then give it back to him before the meeting started. The whole interaction was very positive.\n\nNow we'll skip ahead to Saturday night, or more accurately, 1 AM on Sunday morning. I hadn't spoken about the event to this manager since Wednesday, and I had last been at work on Thursday, so I knew a confirmation message was called for. I was still a little unsure until about exactly that time, though, so I decided to message him on Facebook right away. I texted, and I quote \"I'll be coming to the superhero party tomorrow, so please bring a shirt for me! Thanks\". Not the most formal interaction, I admit, but I thought that because it had already discussed, I didn't need to go through all the formalities, and that doing so again might even be strange. I didn't think he'd be awake to see it, but I knew he only lived a block away from work, and that he would have his bag with him anyways, so it should be no trouble.\n\nAnyways, I went to bed and then woke up at 9:45. I saw there was a text from 8:15 that just read \"Are you kidding me?\" This is a somewhat ambiguous message that does lean towards the negative, but I decided not to respond. I should also mention that I largely do not communicate with this manager online, only face to face, and thus did not know their online mannerisms, making me more unsure about how to interpret this message.\n\nAnyways, I arrive at the office about 20 minutes before the event starts. A fair amount of people are already there, including the manager. I say hi, and he almost immediately begins chewing me out in front of multiple other staff members. He said he did not appreciate being asked at 1 AM for a shirt of his, and he did not appreciate my \"tone.\" He even said he hoped I had been drunk and it had impaired my judgement, to which I stretched the truth and said I had been--in reality, I had had a couple of drinks, but I had felt fairly sober and said basically the same thing I would have otherwise. I tried to probe a little to exactly what part of it upset him, and it seemed to strictly be the time that I sent it at. He made it out to seem like not enough notice at all. I asked him if he remembered our conversation on Wednesday, and he said he did, but that texting him at 1 in the morning was just not right. It hadn't woken him up or anything, but it struck the wrong chord with him. His whole argument seemed rather silly to me, but I knew I shouldn't press, so I acquiesced.\n\nHe then immediately switched to a cheery demeanour and took me to his bag, where he showed me 3 or 4 other shirts, which I knew made up most of his collection. I picked the one I liked the most, he happily gave it to me, and he went to another part of the office.\n\nThe event went fine. I didn't talk to him much during it, but I could see that he had worn his coolest shirt, and that he was getting more compliments on his than I was mine, which I was totally fine with. At the end of the event, I went up to him and gave him back his shirt. There was again no hint of animosity, and he simply asked if I had had a good time and if people had liked my shirt. He then told me some of the compliments he got on his. He left shortly after, since he wasn't part of my department.\n\nSo, Reddit, is his behaviour justified considering all the circumstances? How do you suggest I not upset him if another event like this one happens in the future and I need his help again? What would you think an appropriate time to message him would be? Thanks!",

This seems like the perfect sub to ask this question. So if you're willing to answer on those grounds, here's the hypothetical.\n\nMy father is very sick and needs a replacement kidney. He's on a wait list and may get chosen to receive a suitable donor organ. His doctor says the chances of getting the organ he needs before he dies are quite good, but not good enough to make any promises...and it is certain that there will be a lot of suffering and serious medical procedures necessitated while he waits, so he would be much better off finding a compatible donor to volunteer ASAP.\n\nHe asked his extended family, including me, and I told him I would take whatever test there is to see if I'm a viable donor. (But to be honest, I know I'm not willing to do it because I'm too much of a coward to really go through with surgery that is not absolutely necessary for my survival.) I take the test and discover that I am not a suitable donor for my father because of some uncorrectable defect and the doctor will not accept me.\n\nHere's the question: If I only tell my father about the fact that I'm not a suitable donor, am I a liar, or am I telling the only truth that matters?\n\nThere's a legitimate medical reason why I can't do it, so I feel my personal selfish reason is totally moot, and I'm not lying when I say I won't do it because the doctor says it's not safe. I've always wondered if people agree with this thinking, and if not, was I an asshole to take the test to begin with? If so, why should this scenario force me to reveal my dark personal shortcomings?\n\nTL;DR My dad needs a kidney and I won't give mine because I'm a coward.

    "selftext": "Hi there, so I started dating this girl like 3 months ago and my sister asked me if I wanted to bring her on the family skiing trip with me. I said yes. Anyway, going into this relationship I was pretty clear that one of the things I'm most scared of is having a suffocating partner. I made it a point that I need my space but I've been feeling like I have trouble actually getting the point across sometimes. Anyway, in the month leading up to this trip we spent time at our homes far apart, but we were talking to each other every day, probably at a minimum of 2-3 hours spaced out throughout the day. I thought it was a lot sometimes, but everytime I tried to get out of it I felt like I kind of got slithered back in. Anyway, by the end of the month leading up to the trip I was feeling a little worn out. I asked her if we could take the three days before the trip to just not talk. And we agreed that was for the best. The first night she dealt with some issues but the second and third nights she called me again almost looking to pick a fight. We argued about something dumb. Anyway going into the first few days of the trip things seemed alright. We spoke and made up the night she got in. Things got worse though when we actually started trying to snowboard. I had never done it before and so she was gonna show me a few things, although eventually we decided to take a class. During the class, she started to get worn out pretty quick and eventually her legs were hurting, so she ended her lesson an hour early. When I finished my lesson, I was sad that she had to go early but I also felt like she was kind of mad at me for keeping on. The next day we tried actually snowboarding down the small slope next to our cabin. After we got to the bottom, she was tired and in pain (what I assumed to be soreness, although according to her after the fact was far more severe) so she decided to stay back. I asked her if it was alright if I went down the ski-lift once more and she said it was (she meanwhile was going to ask my mother to pick her up from the restaurant at the base of the mountain) , but again I felt like she was mad at me. Anyway, from the house, which you can also access via the slopes she messaged me saying she wasn't able to get in touch with my mom. I went looking around the place we rented and noticed that all of the cars were gone and none of the family was around. I figured she was kind of SOL on getting back, but she's an adult with a wallet and a phone.  Anyway, she got back and started talking about how she felt that I was treating her poorly and never giving her the time of day. But that can't be further from how I feel. Honestly we've been spending pretty much every second together with these few exceptions. She keeps bringing up how she has noone else here, and I know that- but sometimes I feel like she just demands my time. Like she'll fall asleep on my lap and expect me to stay there, and not move, and she'll grumble at me if I do. I'm not trying to be mean to her, and I was certainly not trying to be a dick in general. But I think I'm just getting frustrated with what feels like someone pulling for time I don't feel like I have. She on the other hand feels like she's doing a lot for me and not getting any reciprocation. She mentioned how much her ticket was to come on this trip with us, and she mentioned how she doesn't complain when I smoke (something she initially said attracted her to me) and her feeling was that I don't reciprocate as strongly. And sometimes that might be true. A lot of times she gets irritated at me when I don't say \"I love you\" to her before I go to bed. I know it's stupid to be using that word so early on, but I do honestly feel like a better person sometimes when I'm with her. But she expects me to constantly use it. To constantly reaffirm how I feel towards her, and I don't have the ability to do that on command. Anyway, we had a big fight where a lot of this stuff boiled to the surface. I'm not sure where to go from here because I can't tell if she's being unreasonable or I am.\nSo, Am I the Asshole?",

When they took a break he would makeout with other girls around her. (High school btw). And it made her feel like shit. When they got back together, he would tickle and hold hands with another girl (who is his Ex gf) while ignoring my friend. He constantly changes his opinion to fit in which is really irritating.

I couldn't remember her name and my classmate suggested Susan B Anthony and I said no she isn't black. My friends bf piped up saying \"yes she is\" and I said OK I'll look it up to prove it to you. So I did and when I showed it to him, he said \"whatever, I don't care about black people\". Just like that. No confusion over what he said. When I brought it up to my friend saying I think he's a piece of shit (poor handling, probably makes me the assholes really) she said that he told her he was saying he doesn't care about race. Which is absolutely not what he said. But she said he has a black sister which I didn't know.

After asking the people if it was theirs, and no one replied that it was, I emptied it. I noticed the clothes were still a bit damp, but i wasn't about to just fill the drier back up and wait for the person to come back since there was multiple other people waiting on the driers, and i had no idea whose clothes these were.\n\nSo i put the damp clothes in a basket and off to the side, and loaded up my clothes. After i put my money in, the girl whose clothes they were showed up and got mad at me for unloading it when they were still damp. Am I the asshole?\n\nShould also be noted that this girl was taking up 2 driers.\n\nEdit:\nGlad to see this got some attention as I feel it is an important issue.\n\nCouple of facts:\n-any time I've been late I've had my clothes moved, I have no qualms with this because it was my fault I was late. (Would you guys be mad if you showed up late to something and your seat you reserved was given away?)\n-no one had seen the owner of the clothes for a while (not since they put their clothes in)\n-someone else started removing this person's clothes from another drier (she was taking up 2 driers during ultra busy time) and I followed their lead\n\nI have no regrets about not waiting, but I did notice that these clothes were still damp, and maybe I should have given her another minute or two of leeway.\n\n\nMy conclusion: I think she was being a selfish asshole for making us all wait and unload her stuff.  I think that I could have reacted to her asshole behavior more nicely and gave her more of a cushion.  But I was pissed and impatient and so was everyone else in line.  I think she was an asshole and it caused me to respond like an asshole.

    "selftext": "I know how things tend to go on this sub. Even though you're supposed to \"describe **both sides in detail**\", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.\n\nI'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. \n\nI'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. \n\nAt night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.\n\nNormally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.\n\nHere comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. \n\nIn her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. \n\nFor the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.\n\nI got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. \n\nI didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.\n\nI walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. \n\nI deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: \"Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]\"\n\nAfter another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, \"What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend.\" I say, \"Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.\"\n\nThis triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. \n\nMore transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, \"I'm mad. I need space.\"\n\nShe sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. \n\nThis begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.\n\nAs I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. \n\nI'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, \"Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up.\" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm (31M) a light sleeper, so when my girlfriend (29F) talks with her friends on the phone in the morning, it wakes me up and I get mad.",

We're like the same person and it was really nice to reconnect with a member of that side my family because I never really knew them. So while becoming close with him I became very close with his wife/ my sister in law. She has always been so nice to me. I had my first child last year and she threw me a beautiful shower no cost. She also has her own photography thing she does and she has taken beautiful pictures of my daughter also free of charge. So I have always kinda felt indebted to her. So yesterday she asked me if she could come over or if the next night ( tonight ) would be better. I'm really not good with last minute plans being a new mom and honestly I'm not the best at keeping plans period ( which might be part of what makes me an asshole). So tonight something came up and my mom needed me to come help her with some things. Not thinking I went over there. At this time my sister in law haddent texted me all day and I honestly forgot about our plans. I look at my phone and I have a missed call and a text from her. She had tired to call me an hour prior to tell me she was coming and I didn't answer. Then I read the text and it's her saying she was almost to my house. I apologize and tell her how bad I feel and that I would be more then willing to stop by her house after I left and planed on giving her any gas money she wasted. I also said if not it was fine and we could meet in a diffrent day. She then text me and tells me it's not fine because she was at my house and that she was going home. I haven't seen her since before Christmas and she had gotten me and my daughter some gifts she left on my porch. They were really nice and that made me feel even more like an asshole.

He's been waffling on buying the ticket (which is normal, he's bought them one day in advance before) which stresses me out.\n\nThis past weekend, I accidentally took a sip of my coworker's coffee (same Starbucks cup) and freaked out, because she is getting over being sick and she might have had a cold sore. I came home and told my boyfriend, and set up a doctor's appointment for the same week (tomorrow). My boyfriend let me know that he was thinking about cancelling the trip, \"until we know what's going on.\"\n\nNow, I understand that he has every right to be focused on his health and not want to get the cold sore virus. But it's really frustrating to me that he has a) not expressed any concern about me/my health b) assumed that I was doing nothing (?) and essentially demanded that I see a doctor, even though I had already set up the appointment and c) basically put our relationship on hold because of this.\n\nI let him know that if he seriously didn't want to get a cold sore that badly, that we could break up. Because they're highly contagious. And, from the ~2 hours of internet research I conducted, I don't think that there's a way to prevent outbreaks/keep them from spreading.\n\nAITA? I know that I'm really upset at myself for this, and I really don't want the virus, so I understand where he's coming from.

Like either it's a deal-breaker or it's not, but I don't feel like avoiding me right now is fair, especially because I have no signs of a cold sore.

    "selftext": "recently, MY roomates/friends have kicked me out with two months notice. and due to the stress of finding a new place and working a new job plus other mental issues and depression, I was told by a doctor that I had to take medical leave from my new job. which made them decide to lay me off. \n\nso, i've been kicked out of my place, lost my job and now I have to move back in with my parents in my small home town 6 hours away. the same small town that gave me these issues and depression. \n\nLong story short. 6 months ago, myself, and three others James, Clyde and stacy (all fake names) decided to all move in together in a house. \n\nWe didn't think there would be a problem seeing as three of us (all early 20's guys) had already lived together for a few years/months before this point. and one was close friend\n\nand I will say, The apartment WAS messy. the kind of messy you would expect from 3 20something guys. OF course we did all try to keep it clean and maintained. I remember several times making daily chore lists and delegating tasks for a bi monthly clean up. But alas. we were all messy in our own ways and it never really got better.\n\nInitially there were supposed to be four of us moving in, One for each of the four bedrooms. But james decided to have his girlfriend jenny move in as well. To which we all agreed so long as we split the utilities between all of us. \n\nlater, she became upset because in a heated argument over their own moldy cheese (they were upset that I didn't throw it out for them, because she's allergic to mold. but i've always been taught just to cut the mold off of cheese. and I wasn't aware of her allergy.) I told her that she didn't actually have much say in the household matters because she wasn't paying rent. \n\nmy \"being rude\" to her  has become one of the main reasons that they kicked me out.\n\n\nbefore we moved. myself and stacy had a slight argument over what stuff goes where. she essentially said that she intended to bring family and friends over, so she wanted us guys to keep \"our crap\" out of the public areas. for context, all three of us guys are gamers. We all have high end PC's and tv's consoles and etc. \n\nmy issue was that I wasn't happy with my possessions being referred to as \"crap\" and \"junk\"\n\nAND we weren't sure what the layout of the house would be.So I didn't want each of us to have to be confined to our rooms because the main living rooms had to be free of our stuff. \n\nLo and behold. We found a decent place where we could each get what we had wanted. There was a spacious basement for our \"man cave\" and the mid floor could be kept untouched. \n\nUnfortunately, Problems kept arising. there were messes, People were leaving things in places. and I feel like there was a lot of unfair double standards being hoisted upon me. for example. a book I left on the coffee table was tossed into my room because it was \"A mess\" while several Ikea magazines were left on the other coffee table since we moved in.\n\nI would be expected to drop whatever I was doing to clean up any inconvenience, while there were several points where I would simply work around other people's messes. \n\nA turkey roaster and pile of magazines would be left in the corner of the living room and go unnoticed until I put a box of home brewed wine in the same corner. \n\nor when I leave a couple of dirty dishes at my desk it's an issue. But when one of my roomates has a similar pile in their bedroom, it's never brought up.\n\ngetting down to it. My roomates are upset both by the messes, but seemingly moreso of the fact that I would argue that something was a blaring double standard. \n\n\nmy roomates are upset that \"everything has to be an argument\" \n\nto that I would say, it wouldn't need to be an argument if everybody was treated with the same standards. \n\nnot to mention that A lot of the so called \"messes\" were in my eyes very minor and over exaggerated.\n\n http://imgur.com/a/t42UC Here's an example of two of them, and the reactions that followed. \n\nthe first one I admit was me I was up late and made myself some food before going to bed with the plans to wash the dishes in the morning. The crumbs I didn't notice in the dimly lit kitchen. The second one Was blamed on me, though I had been at work in the time it was made,\n\nThose are just the most recent two that I could save before I deleted the group chat, because I was tired of the petty bickering. \n\nand Clyde for the most part just wants to stay neutral. He moved everything he owns to his room and pretty much never leaves it except for work, because He knows he would be targeted for the same stuff I am.\n\nSO, am I the asshole for believing that I've been unfairly treated here?",

    "selftext": "So, a little context. \n\n\nI'm currently graduated from secondary school and waiting to get into a college. Once I'm in college, I'll get a laptop for school work. There's about 3 months till it starts. \n\n\nMy (younger) brother took up a part time job recently and used his pay to buy a new computer. He replaced the old computer, which our dad had bought for the two of us to use, and everything that was hooked up to the old computer, keyboard, mouse, printer monitor, was connected to the new one. \n\n\nNow, I wouldn't mind using the old computer, but the thing is there are no other monitors, keyboards, mouses, etc in our home and I feel it is unfair I have to fork out money just to use the same computer I've always been using. What's more, there isn't enough space in the house for another computer setup. \n\n\nI just want to occasionally use it to play a bit of Overwatch/TF2 from time to time, as well as maybe write a few blog posts. I understand he worked and earned the money to buy the computer and it is completely his, I just want to use it for three months because it is the only computer in our household I can use. \n\n\nI have brought it up to our father a couple of times. The first time, my brother agreed to let me use it, but after a few days of complaining about why I logged out from his Steam/Spotify/Facebook, he locked it again. \n\n\nI just brought it up to our dad again and after a small argument where my brother insisted the computer belonged to him, my father said he'd pay him the full cost of the computer. He said he didn't want our household to become one where we fought over and refused to share our stuff. If he gave my brother the money for it, then it belonged to him was his logic. \n\n\nI feel bad for making a big fuss over something so inconsequential and I do feel like I'm in the wrong somewhat, but I don't think it is completely my fault. I really want an outsider's perspective on this matter and tell me if I'm being an ass. ",

I'm a happily married stay at home mother. The only man's number I have in my phone besides my husband's is family. I dont Facebook and I really have no life outside of my family. Reddit is the only form of social media ( if you can call it that) I use and I found it thru my husband. So you can imagine my surprise when last night between midnight and 1am I get a call from an unknown number. It appeared to be out of state. So I didn't answer and sent a text saying who's this? Shortly after that I receive a voicemail from this number. And...just...wow there is some woman screaming in hysterics on my voicemail. Calling me a hoe  telling me her and her \" man \" had been together for ten years. Couldn't understand much else through the hysterical screaming other then she said I was \" waisting my time and my....pussy? So i send this number a text saying my name was in fact not her \" man's \" mistress and I have never seen the number in my life. Haven't heard anything since. Tried to call after that voice mail to let her know she had the wrong number and I'd appreciate if she would not leave crazy voicemails on my phone and got the recording telling me that the voicemail had not been set up. This woman called someone she didn't know and who doesn't know her and \" her man \" from Adam. Not to mention then berraided that person when obviously you didn't even know if it was for sure who you were looking for. If I did that to someone I would feel so bad and apologize to that person for  the crazy ass voice mail I left. Am I the asshole for thinking it she should at least say \" oops wrong number my bad \"?",

Usually I'm talking about her anxiety and trying to help her find solutions to it/related problems. She will later say she's allowed to interrupt me because I was making her feel worse.\n\nRegardless of her feelings, I don't think it's OK for her to interrupt people.

She told me why it upset her, and I began to respond. I didn't immediately say \"I won't do it again\" even though she later said she needs to hear that right away. She interrupts me and tells me I need to say that.\n\nShe tells me the things she has to do during the day. I offer solutions to those things, and she interrupts me telling me she's already thought about it and she just wants to vent (We agreed that she should tell me when she is about to vent, because she tells me her problems all the time).\n\nShe tells me she can only do XYZ in condition ABC.

    "selftext": "About 4 months ago I asked my friend to move in with me and my boyfriend. We had a spare room and didn't really need to rent but I knew she'd just changed jobs so couldn't afford much, plus I thought it would be nice to have her around and we'd be helping her out rent wise.\n\nThe apartment is brand new and costed quite a bit (my bf owns it) and shortly after she moved in I got annoyed because she didn't seem to be as conscious or careful/caring of the property as I/we would have liked her to have been (or as much as we are). \n\nShe's not messy at all - but it was the little things that added up like: 1) breaking a mug and didn't tell us or offer to replace (we wouldn't have minded but an offer to telling us as a min. would have been appreciated) 2) she roasted a chicken (totally okay) but didn't use any foil and grease splattered all over the inside of the oven, she said she would clean but then didn't and then got upset later when we asked if she could please use foil because \"ovens aren't meant to be cleaned\" 3) leaves minor chocolate stains on the couch, she probably doesn't notice because they are small but I end up dabbing to them out\n\nNow she's a great flatmate, always wants to cook for us or her friends, chatty and actually really clean compared to a lot of people. But I got a bit OCD/paranoid from things like the examples above, and instead of confronting her I just started to clean around her (like sweep the laundry after she left a bit of powder on the floor or clean out the laundry when she left a clump of solidified powder in there). \n\nYesterday we both finally reached our limit and argued about it and she said that she doesn't feel like it's her home and she's stressed all the time because I'm cleaning after/around her and she doesn't think she's messy at all. She's always trying to make sure things are clean more than normal now and I've been basically awful to make her feel like that. Also we do have a weekly cleaner and she doesn't understand why she needs to be super clean if we pay someone to come around (okay, I get that)\n\nI agreed maybe I can tune back the OCD. But she feels like she has an equal share to the flat because she does pay rent. But ultimately I feel like my bf owns the flat and we should be grateful we pay so little rent and repay the gratefulness by making sure everything is really well looked after. \n\nI hate that I've turned into \"that\" kind of \"landlord\" to live with (I get that I don't even own the house but trying to manage my bfs feelings of his property) and I am ashamed some of the things I've resented her for are a bit petty.\n\nAm I an arsehole? Advice and perspectives appreciated. \n\nTl;dr: make my flatmate feel unwelcomed because I clean after her/around her",

One thing I\u2019m not so keen on, however, is that he lets his pubes grow wild and free. Now don\u2019t misunderstand me, I still think he\u2019s very attractive, pubes and all. I just have a much stronger preference towards neatly trimmed pubic hair as opposed to having a bush down there. That said, I never felt like it was my place to bring it up \u2013 after all, it\u2019s his body, and he\u2019s welcome to do as he pleases with it.\n\nMy boyfriend lives about two hours away from me, so during the week we primarily communicate through Skype. Last night, however, I got a little drunk with my roommates and was a few glasses of wine in before we had our skype call. I don\u2019t know exactly how it came up in conversation \u2013 I think he was actually talking about his body hair \u2013 but I made a tactfully-worded comment along the lines of \u201cY\u2019know, I\u2019d be curious to see how it would look if you trimmed up your pubic hair a bit, just out of curiosity. I\u2019d bet it would look good on you\u201d.\n\nHe seemed a bit taken back by my comment. He asked me if I think he should shave off all his other body hair as well, which I said no to \u2013 I like his body hair, I just wished that he\u2019d trim his pubic hair just a tad. He said that he\u2019d never trimmed his pubic hair before, and that he might try it. But I could tell that it was something he\u2019d never given much thought to.\n\nThe rest of our skype conversation was great, but now I can\u2019t help but to feel that I made him feel insecure about his body. I don\u2019t want him to think that he isn\u2019t good enough or that I don\u2019t accept him as he is, that isn\u2019t true at all, I just thought he would look good trimmed up. He\u2019s not expressed that he\u2019s upset to me or anything, and I think I\u2019m probably just overthinking it and he probably just saw it as a random comment in the midst of a longer conversation, but looking back on my comment I feel bad for having made it, especially since I wouldn\u2019t have made it sober unless we had been together for a lot longer than a month.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*Edit*: Thanks for the responses!

    "selftext": "SPOILER ALERT FOR HAMILTON (and also Harry Potter I guess??)\n\nThis one's a doozy. \n\nMyself (19), my mom, and my younger brother (16) live in/around/close to New York City. Over the years, we've made a number of trips over to the Big Apple to see the city, the touristy stuff, and, of course, the Broadway shows.\n\nWe've probably gone once every year since middle school to a different show. The three of us really enjoy the stuff, and my mom usually gets the soundtracks for the musicals to jam on the way home. Bunch of theater nerds, basically.\n\nSo, a few winters ago, my mom was in the loop enough to hear that there was this crazy new musical with a lot of buzz called Hamilton. She got tickets early and we were able to see it before it got too hectic. \n\nA bit more backstory: both my mom and brother are history people. She reads biographies of past presidents, even the one Hamilton is based off. He probably is going to do something history-y(?) in college. \n\nBackstory #2: My mom *HATES* spoilers. Whenever anyone even mentions talking about the plot for a book, movie, play, whatever, she covers her ears or yells at people. As an example, one time, my dad accidentally revealed that two side characters in a show don't get married and she wouldn't talk to him for a day. Maybe exaggeration but it's still real bad.\n\nAlright, so. I'm home for Thanksgiving and we decide to go see a play. We get up there and we're walking to our show which just so happens to take us by the Hamilton theater. There's this huge line out front of people waiting [Saturday after Thanksgiving is apparently a big theater day]. Later, I learned that Hamilton actually broke the record for the most money ever earned on a Thanksgiving weekend. \n\nPersonally, I don't like spoilers either, and I honestly do try to avoid them as best as I can. But my brother and I always poke fun at my mom for her stark anti-spoiler policy. Like, whenever we start talking about a show and she starts to think we're going to spoil it, we say \"&lt;character from show&gt; kills Dumbledore!\" (because we're really funny) \n\nSo, back to NYC. We're walking by this theater. Lots and lots of people. Paid lots of money. Lots of buzz for a super hyped up musical. We're joking and laughing about random stuff, just enjoying life, y'know?\n\nAnd, as a rad joke, I cup my hands and loudly shout \"Hamilton dies!\" \n\nAnd my mom and my brother both look at me like I've just took a dump in the middle of the street.\n\nI started to try to joke with them, poking fun at my mom's oversensitivity to spoilers, but my brother wouldn't have it. Lines had been crossed. No amount of Harry Potter spoiler jokes would fix that.\n\nNow, let's break this down.\n\nOne: The musical Hamilton is about the life of Alexander Hamilton, a *real* person. Someone who was alive in the 1700's. Someone who is very reasonably dead. Anyone older than the age of 5 could tell you that much. You can't live that long.\n\nAnd two: In the opening song, Aaron Burr says \"I'm the damn fool who shot him\" and then it echoes like four times, which has got to be some Romeo-and-Juliet-explaining-the-future plot device. So, not only is it clear from the fact that Hamilton was a real person that he is dead, but the play straight up acknowledges it within the first five minutes.\n\nHowever, the other two in my family think that this is bloody murder of the highest degree. They say:\n\nOne: People don't know he's going to die *in the musical.* They could be coming into this with no expectations (like my mom loves to do) and then knowing that this death happens at *some point* is a spoiler. Despite the fact that I never said he dies during the show, but just that he dies, which is a factual historical statement.\n\nTwo: People paid a *lot* of money to go that weekend and I was detracting from their experience. Which could be fair, but I don''t feel like there's any cause to get so broken up over something that gets revealed like this at the beginning of the show. I wasn't looking towards the crowd, but apparently, while some people smiled at the joke, one eldery man was giving me dagger eyes. \n\nThis is where you come in, r/AITA. Did I really spoil this musical? Is my family just overreacting? Should I go out and spoil some endings to more musicals?!?!?!\n\nTL;DR: I told some strangers that a bastard orphan died. My mom got mad, so I told her it was really Dumbledore.\n\n-------\n\nFair points, everyone. Will be taking the L on this one. Thanks for the comments! :)",

They won't get it until they all move out. \n\nI feel it's unfair to me that my part of the damage deposit be used to give this new person a free ride. So I asked that they charge this new person for at least 3/4 of my part of the damage deposit. And buy out my part essentially. \n\nThey say that this is unfair to the new person as according to them there are already enough damages that we wouldn't get anything back. This is in the forms of two chips in the already warped and chipped counter. And a spot of paint(paint remover that I painted over to keep it from further rusting)  on the dryer. \n\nI say three things in response.\n\n1. The landlord's have already replaced the refrigerator, the dishwasher, and the oven, without concern. \n\n(I fixed the handle on the old oven whicj was the only issue and the landlord's preferred to keep it and the put the new second hand oven in storage just in case.)\n\n2. Every appliance in the house is second hand.  \n\n3. There's no way we've done $2000 of damage to the house in the past six months. \n\n4. There is another set of working washer and dryer sitting in the laundry room unused for that exact purpose. \n\n\nThey've also said that I should pay for half the water on the utilities bill because I started taking an extra shower towards the end because it relieves stress for me. \n\nThey didn't include that there are 6 people currently living there and one extra who's been staying on our couch because of a bad breakup. \n\nOne extra shower isn't going to jack up the utilities any more than an extra person living there. IMHO. \n\nI've told them that my funds are on freeze until I get my damage deposit back. \n\nI can add any other information. If needed. \n\n\nBut am I being the asshole for this?",

    "selftext": "This is a little convoluted so as background information, I live in a very small HOA run community. Our rules state that no resident may park in a way that could impede another from exiting/entering their residence. Everyone tries to be courteous but we only have one car spot in the 2 car garage (since our washer and dryers and water heater are located in the garage and state law says a barrier to prevent a car hitting the any of that must be in place before a car may be parked on that side of the garage). We also have a parking lot of 11 spaces for 12 units that is always packed. \n\n\n\nSo this all started the day my boyfriend and I moved into our new house.  Now, I grew up in the South and maybe things are different in other places, but generally you welcome new neighbors to the neighborhood. We bought a house in California and day one, while we're moving in, our neighbor comes over and tells us not to park in the left spot in front of our garage because she has trouble pulling out of her garage if a car is there as the houses sit perpendicular to eachother. No hello, no introduction, no welcome to the neighborhood, just \"Don't park there.\"  Okay....nice to meet you too.\n\n\n\nOf course, I don't want to make a stir, because I'm not one to cause a scene so I just smile and ensure her we'll make sure not to park there.  And we don't. It's super inconvenient for us because at the time we had three cars so one goes in the garage, one on the right side of the drive and the third just has to hope there's a spot open in the parking lot. \n\n\n\nWe've lived here for over a year now. Twice a car was parked there out of necessity (my boyfriend) because there were no spots available.  The first time, she came over and asked that we move the car. And I moved it for her right then and appologized. The second, much later, I left the house to get the mail and she is standing there waiting and starts yelling at me about needing to leave her house and having to wait on me. Apparently she had rung our doorbell, which had broken a week prior so I had no idea she was waiting for me to move my car. Why she didn't knock, I have no idea. I have dogs and they would have barked a few times if someone knocked so I know she didn't. My boyfriend had moved my car to do some work in the garage and forgot to tell me so I had no idea there was a car in her way. Her attitude was passing me off but I again apologized and moved the car for her, very politely.\n\n\n\nNow I want also add that this lady leaves her house maybe once a month and a car in our drive does not block her from backing out of her garage. You would have to cut the wheel pretty far but it by no means blocks anyone in. So the fact that she sat out there stewing and getting mad at me about it is pretty ridiculous to me. Especially since she stayed mad at me once I explained the doorbell didn't work.   \n\n\n\nA WHOLE YEAR LATER, a friend needed a new place on short notice because of a bad roommate. We have a spare room and decided to rent it out to him. He has one car. So now we have four cars in a neighborhood that is quickly running out of parking spaces as a lot of other people in the community are buying new cars. I get a knock on my door. It's the neighbor. Unbeknownst to me, my roommate has parked in the forbidden spot because there were no other spots available in the community. She puts up a huge fuss about it, I apologize and go wake up my roommate, who works nights, (it's 11am at this point) and he moves his car to a red curb so she can get out. She didn't leave for another hour or two so he had to stay up until she left so he could put his car back into a legal spot. \n\n\nI have to stress that we've parked in that spot now 3 times in almost 2 years and somehow, I am always the one getting bitched at by this lady even though I am never the one to park there and she knows this. She's incredibly rude about it every time, cutting me off when I apologize and lecturing me as if we do this on a daily basis and acts like we're parking directly behind her car when in reality, she could pull out without us moving.  \n\n\n\nThe night before last, my roommate parked there again. He gets home at 3am and there were no other spots. It was pouring raining and it's basically a crap shoot as to whether this lady will leave her house tomorrow or not so he parked on the left side of the drive. I have no idea about it.  The next day, there's a knock on my door. Guess who?  She starts yelling immediately.  \"Whose car is that?!\" I got about as far as, \"Oh, I'm sorry, Matt works nights, he's slee...\" before she cuts me off \"Go get him! I don't care if he's sleeping, I want to talk to him.\"  Now, I'm a polite person and I don't like confrontation but I'm not going to be yelled at on my doorstep and have demands made of me. So I slammed to door in her face and went back to what I was doing. She yelled through the door that she would call the police and she wanted that car moved now. Matt slept until 3pm and then got up for work. I didn't wake him up to move his car. He texted me later to let me know that she yelled at him too when he left about having his car towed. \n\n\n\n Was I wrong here? I don't mind not parking there even though it's a pain in the ass and I certainly don't mind moving my car for her since I'd told her we would avoid parking there but her attitude is always shitty, and I'm just trying to be polite and fix the situation. I guess this time I was just tired of being yelled at.",

I asked him if he could leave it in the bathroom and he said he likes it on the counter. Then I asked if he could maybe put it on his desk then if he wanted it out in the living area. He then told me to put my purse and pictures and decorations on my desk instead of the counter if that's how I felt about it.

Earlier this week I'm waiting in a bar for her, (not drunk we'd just arrived) and Melody comes in smelling very strongly of smoke and I ask if she could just take a step or two back away from me. I honestly don't think she heard me, but we were talking about a friend at the time and she asks for me to text his number to her. I say yeah, and then repeat can she just take a step back because she smelled of smoke. Melody says that she will take a step away if I just text her the number. I get peeved right then because I have asked twice and I tell her I will send her the number if she takes a step or two back. She says I'm being mean and doesn't understand why I can't give it to her right then. I say I don't understand why she can't take a step back anyway, because I'm texting her the number, it's not like I have to physically hand it to her. Melody says that if I had just given her the number to begin with she would've walked away. I tell her that was unlikely since 1) we were in the middle of a conversation and we only knew each other there and 2) she wasn't going to call him, she hates talking on the phone and it was 11 at night, he's probably sleeping. The most she was going to do was text him. She says nothing to this and we're both obviously annoyed and she still refuses to move away so I put my phone back in my pocket. She vows to follow me around for the rest of the night. There's literally like thirty seconds of silence between us before our other friend, Brant, comes and notices the tension, and Melody immediately tells him that we had a fight because \"FeonixPheathers is being a douchebag and won't give me So&amp;So's number because he says I smell like smoke.\" Brant doesn't even listen for my side, but for the rest of the night they call me a douchebag and make jokes that people shouldn't smoke near me since I'm a cigarette nazi.\n\nHonestly, we made up like a minute after that altercation, but it's been eating at me because she said I was being rude by asking her to step away. Was I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: In fairness, I would have stepped a way myself, but I was sitting down in a crowded bar when she came in and she was standing which is why I didn't think it was a big deal for her to just take a step back.\n\nEDIT 2: And yes I realize I was basically calling Melody \"smelly\" But she *was* smelly. She reeked of cigs that she chose to smoke. It isn't like she doesn't know she smells of cigarettes right after she finishes. She's also my friend and not a stranger. I did not go up to random person  and tell them they stink and to take two steps back.",

I try to be mindful of this whenever I walk him.\n\nAfter the dog had done his business, I was encouraging him back up the apartment stairs when he stood and looked at me for a second. Then he jerked his head, popping his collar off, and took off like a bullet.\nWithout knowing what to do and afraid we'd never find him if I lost sight of him, I bolted after the dog. I chased him for blocks and blocks through the suburbs, cutting through peoples' backyards, through fields, through the bad part of the neighborhood, and finally edging onto the main roads. The dog avoided me like his life depended on it, and I lost sight of him multiple times but kept going. At one point a woman gave me a ride in her car to catch up with him.\n\nEventually, the dog made a mistake, and I was able to catch him in a fenced-in garden.\nI have asthma, and I was red in the face and in pretty bad shape by this time, still wearing my winter jacket. The dog was frothing at the mouth from exertion.\n\nGetting back was its own ordeal. I didn't know where I was and had to stop and ask for directions back home.\n\nEventually, I made it back to the apartment. A five-minute pee break had taken something like 45 minutes to an hour. I thought my boyfriend might be out looking for us by this point.\n\nWhen I got inside, he was still where I'd left him, sitting on the couch watching TV. Winded, I dramatically recanted the adventure I had just been on. I took my jacket off and jokingly threw it at him (I apologized for this later). I was a little irritable and put-out from all the effort, but not angry. I was looking for some kind of sign of appreciation from my boyfriend for going to (what I felt) was a big effort to get his dog home safe. \nInstead, he reminded me that he had warned me that the dog could slip his collar. He seemed annoyed with me. \n\nWe got into a fight. He told me that when I choose to walk the dog, he is MY responsibility, and chasing him down was the right thing to do, not something I should expect a thank you for.

Among my Christmas presents there were three packages of imported coffee: two big ones (standard coffee bags), one from Ethiopia and other from Vietnam and one small, much exclusive, from Yemen.

At the end, we consumed half of the Ethiopian and the Yemenese (he didn't like the Vietnamese).\n\nThe day I left, my father was going to take me by car to where I currently live.

I told him that I had shared with him all the coffee during all the days we were together, and that the coffee is actually a present from my mom, who intended that I enjoyed it. I don't mind sharing, but giving it away just seemed wrong to me.

    "selftext": "A little backstory first: My age is 21 and my parents divorced about 8 years ago,but it was quite the bad kind of divorce and my father still takes money from my mother every month. Fighting this would have been quite the hassle a year ago since my sister still lives only with me and my mother and isn't agreed in the co parenting. However, since a year this isn't true since my sister is old enough to make her own decisions, but my mother won't do it to evade extra damage to the family.\n\nMy problem however is that I find her forcing her way of living onto me every time I get home. I get complaints about how I am never home and how I am always gaming (in a retrospective, I game about 3 hours a week nowadays so I think it is kinda weird, but in her defense, I did game a lot a few years back to release me from stress.)\nShe also accuses me of destroying their way of living, because I don't live exactly like she did when she was young. She worked a near full time job waitress and took care of a few small children too in her free time. This because her parents forced her to do so, because she didn't want to live like them because she wanted to go to the art acedemy.\n\nHowever, I want to live my life more in a way that I enjoy more than make money that I will never spent kind of way. This causes a lot of conflicts within our relationship, she describes me mostly as a lazy fuck because of this while I actually am enjoying myself with my girlfriend whom I see once a week if I'm lucky.\n\nWhen she calls me lazy, she mostly makes references to when she was young and how she had to care for me at my age. The first thing that pops in my mind, be proud of me that I am not a father at 21, but then I would be evicted immediately. In her defense however, it is true that she had a lot more knowledge of finances at her age. And she was also able to live on her own, which I don't find myself ready for yet.\n\nBut why I feel like an asshole mainly, she refers to me like I got a lot of my dad. That means I am a self loathing drugs abusing asshole mainly and nothing is my fault. That just hurts me, because I do care about the people around me, but I also learned from their divorce to take care of myself first. At least that was the life lesson they both told me after they divorced. But in the end I only get hatred because of my choices and I actually need to make the \"choices\" they laid out for me.\n\nIn case my story doesn't make sense at all, am I the asshole for trying to live my own life, before trying exactly what my mother wants?\n\n( by the way, please be honest with me. If it's the case that I am the asshole, then I will find a way to get out of my house and go live on my own. This will probably be the case even when I am not, but that is not what this is about.

    "selftext": "I finally got the balls to ask out my best friend yesterday and she rejected me wholeheartedly. I tried to take it in stride and have. I read online that the best way to get over being rejected by a friend is to spend less time with them. Either they will realize that they actually do like you or you can get over them. \n\nSo I told her \"I really like you which is why I'm gonna have to pull back for a while. I hope you understand.\" \n\nShe replied with \"What do you mean by pull back?\" \n\nI said \" Like not hang out with you as much.\" \n\nShe said \"okay :////\" \n\nAfter that I went to bed and I thought it was fine. At around midnight, I woke up and I had a snap from her that was just black with the text \"I just don't want to lose my best friend\" and I started to feel really bad. So, my question is, should I just give up and continue trying to be her friend in the same way? Or should I continue trying to distance myself from her in an effort to get over her? Also AITA? And do you think she's trying to manipulate me?\n\nEdit: I asked if she was trying to manipulate me because she doesn't usually act like this. She's more of the one word text repsonse kind of gal.\n\nEdit: I decided that I was being an asshole for ascribing malicious intent to her not being attracted to me. I told her \"Even though, it may take me a lot longer to get over you, I've decided that I'm not going to not be friends with you because I really value your friendship.\" I value the friendship even more than I necessarily value my feelings. And I was being kind of dramatic. It's not really even an infatuation or love I have for her. It was more of a crush. I can easily get over her while still being able to stay \"besties\" with her. I think I'm just gonna stop going out of my way for her now which would probably make both of us more comfortable anyway. She told me it was really mean and she felt sad when I said that. I told her that I'm sorry and that was that I guess. Thanks for all of your help and opinions. \n\nLast edit: Apparently she cried when I told her that I wanted to pull back so I do think I made the right decision here. I doubt she's trying to mainpulate me.\n\nThe conversation went a little something like this \n\nMe: I want you to know that I really value your friendship and appreciate you and you told me that a few weeks ago and I just realized that I've never really told you that so yeah\n\nHer: Yeah I'm really glad you decided to not to stay away because when you said that I got really sad and cried.\n\nMe: I'm sorry. I couldn't stay away from *insert her pet name here*\n\nHer: it's okay and good\n\nMe: what can I do to make it up to you?\n\nHer: everything's fine as long as we stay friends :-)\n\nMe. Always...even if you use 2010 emojis \n \nSo yeah we've gone completely bacj to normal and also you guys who are saying I'm really mean in a few of my comments, some of them are wrong compared to to how I feel now, but still I don't want to delete them so make sure to read all edits and atleast all of the replies in a comment chain before you comment. Thanks!\n\nAlso we're sophomores in high school in case our ages were assumed\n\nEdit: Jesus christ...apparently she likes me now. Check out this thread for more details: https://redd.it/5rxi13",

    "selftext": "Alright so there's a lot to this story but I'll do my best to make it as clear and short as possible. So we are currently in our second year of college, just finished fall semester, 20 years old. I had spent the first year of college at a different school, and transferred to our current school for this past semester. My friend, lets call him Nate, who I had known before attending this school, liked this girl, lets call her Lisa, beginning last spring semester, when I wasn't even there. They were just friends, nothing more, and I guess he developed feelings for her. Anyway they hung out a lot during that spring semester, even over the summer they managed to hang out even though they live pretty far away from each other. This past fall semester I transfer to the school, naturally I hang out with Nate and am introduced to all of his friends. I quickly learn that he has feelings for Lisa and honestly try to help him out. I give him ideas of things to do with her, ways to express his feelings to her, I really did try my best, he didn't take any of my advice, but that's up to him. There really was no underlying reason or cause behind me trying to help other than just me being a friend and wanting to see him happy. \n\nSo fast forward to like the last week of this past fall semester, me, Nate, Lisa, and her roommate all go to a party, we first pre-game at the girls' room cause it's right down the hall from his place. (I was staying at his place that night cause I live on the other side of campus. Nate's roommate, we'll call him Brett, stayed in that night.) Nate gets incredibly drunk so I am forced to take him out of the party. So me and Lisa take him back to his room and put him to sleep,we ask Brett to watch out for him. I feel bad, feeling responsible for him, and suggested to Lisa we go back to party cause it was her friend's party in the first place, she said yes. So we go back, we talk a little bit, she starts asking me if Nate likes her. I did my best to avoid the question but eventually just admit it cause she knew from my reaction. Lisa's roommate says she is gonna sleep at her boyfriend's place. So eventually me and her leave the party and I walk her back to her place and go in. We ended up talking for a while, cause I was honestly interested in her, (I really wasn't that close with her) and had no intentions of doing anything when I had walked her back. But eventually one thing leads to another and I end up staying over her place that night.\n\nSo the next morning I discuss it with her, before going back to my friends place to pretend I was sleeping there. Brett knew I hadn't stayed there that night cause he heard me and her come up the elevator about an hour or so after we had dropped Nate off. I said to Lisa I should just tell Nate cause I knew Brett knew and eventually he would find out. Brett actually happens to be my best friend since we were children, just for reference. Lisa didn't want to tell Nate because she really didn't want to hurt his feelings. Anyways things kinda go on as normal for a while, until Brett, and I have an argument and he threatens to tell Nate what I did if I don't. I end up telling him and now he's not talking to me, like I can't get to him. Neither is Brett and I can't help but feel like an asshole. I've been talking to Lisa a little bit and have found out that she has had feelings for me for a little while and definitely wouldn't go for someone like Nate, but that's not really my fault. I really didn't want all this to happen. I had no intentions of getting with her, it just happened. But then I also think about the fact that he had an entire year to do something and did nothing, more than half of which, she didn't even know me. I also have no idea what Brett is telling him I did, cause like I said, me and him were in an argument. I'm really not one for drama and it sucks that all this happening. Sorry for the long post and if it's super confusing, any help would be greatly appreciated. Oh also, none of us have seen each other at all because it has been winter break, so all of this has happened through text, so I'm not really sure what's gonna happen when we all get back to school. \n\nTL;DR: I got with my friends crush who I had honestly tried to set him up with and now he's not talking to me.\n\nedit:paragraphs",

    "selftext": "Backstory: I'm 31.  I've been dating my gf for 10 years. We finally saved enough to purchase our first home this past fall.  My gf has family: her brother and mother (whom she's been estranged with her whole life until the past few years), and then her mother's boyfriend.  ONE WEEK after we closed on the house, we got the text that her brother, mother, and mother's bf were evicted from their place a few towns over, and needed a place to crash for \"4 days\", because they had a new place lined up.\n\nAbout the cast:\n\nHer brother is 21. No skills (dropped out of massage school when almost complete), minimum wage jobs so far, and spends hundreds of dollars on his weed habit per month. His food delivery job that he has now only pays him a hundred dollars a week, despite him working 11am-10pm every day of the week.  This is because the delivery company pegs them as \"contractors\" and pays a flat rate of $3.50 per delivery. There's tips, but he only usually has 1 delivery on hour.  If he has bad tips, no money.  We push him to at least try and find a more legitimate job that pays better money, but he refuses or gets offended and storms off.  Also, importantly, he has the ONLY car between the three of them, and monopolizes it for his delivery job.\n\n\nHer mother (henceforth referred to as \"Mom\") is disabled with fibromyalgia, a nerve disease. She is fine, for the most part, but can't work or do things for extended periods of time. Totally understandable and we don't fault her for it.    She is receiving disability benefits and a pension from her last job, all totaling around $2k a month.\n\n\nHer boyfriend is also living with us.  No job, no skills, hasn't worked \"on the books\" for years.  He is very hard to motivate and quite frankly isn't pleasant to be around either because of his complete inability to shower.   \nSide note:  The landlord that evicted them was his former boss, who rented the place to them and deducted the rent from his checks.  Is this illegal or sketchy? Probably. But he doesn't work now because they think Mom needs someone to take care of her 24/7.  He is completely resolved on not needing a job because CT has a program where people can be caregivers for people they live with and get paid for it.  So this dude gets paid to \"take care\" of Mom, around $520 a week for 60 hours.  Add that to the 2 grand fixed income Mom makes.\n\nOnto the story:  \nThe plan was to let them sleep on my old couch in my finished basement for the 4 days.  No big deal.  After arriving with their cat (surprise!) they informed us that the place fell through because they checked their eviction history and were denied.  So, they had to stay at our place a little while longer while they looked for a new place. They had all the money for the initial deposit and such, so it was just a matter of finding a landlord to give them a chance.\n\n\nHowever, it's been tough, observing them.  They don't look for places everyday. They have spent money on expensive take out often, and drink Dunkin Donuts every morning.  Things I don't even do.  Her brother still buys mass amounts of weed and smokes more than most stoners I know.  **I charge them no rent and no money for utilities.**  They literally sit in my basement all day while brother works and drives the car around, giving them no car to look at apartments with.\n\n\nSo, here we are.  A \"little while\" has turned into 4 months. It's been hard to land them somewhere because apparently they make too much for Government housing benefits (Section 8).  So, they need to make it work on their small monthly income.  Landlords have expressed interest but ultimately said \"no\" due to the evictions on their record. \n\n\nNow, the kick in the nuts:  I went out of my way and found a landlord in town to give them a chance. They pleaded their case and he decided to give them a chance, as long as they pay a little more in deposit.  I think, that's fine! I'll give them some extra if they need it.  Come to find, they have NOTHING saved up between the 3 of them.  I was led to believe the whole time they had over 2 grand saved. So, this place will fade away and I'll be back to square one.  \n\n\nOverall, This is taking a toll on my gf and I's sanity.  We just bought this place, our dream home, but can't have my family or friends over because it's embarrassing having these people in my basement.  It's not exactly an apartment down there so there's only common areas.  We've spoken to them many times about all this and they don't seem desperate to get out. Not to mention the random cat they have at my house (we aren't cat people) is tearing up my carpets and doors.  To top it off, we observe them doing nothing to better their situation, so they don't even seem phased living with me.  **Am I the asshole for giving them a deadline to move out?**\n",

For years now, it's been irritating me that she rarely picks up the phone when I call her. She'll call back, but it can be a few days later.\n\nI already follow all the \"rules.\" I don't call in the evening or on weekends because it's pointless. She won't pick up during those times no matter what. This already bothers me because I know I couldn't count on her in an emergency. Plus, I know she's not that busy. There's no way she's completely occupied from Friday afternoon all the way through Monday morning. \n\nLast time I called her was in late December, for three days in a row, and it was actually important but, of course, no answer. The kicker is, I was actually calling because I was trying to help her out. I had something time-sensitive that she needed to know but she blew me off. I don't feel bad that I wound up never telling her.\n\nI have seen her since then- once at my parent's  house and once at her house for her kid's birthday party. I was perfectly nice both times and acted like nothing was wrong and we got along fine.\n\n She must have picked up on the fact that I'm not talking to her by now but I know her and she won't ask. Any time I've gotten mad at her in the past, I always wind up sucking it up and going back to status quo with no confrontation. This time, I really can't be bothered. I'm sick of wasting my time basically waiting for whatever scrap of attention she feels like giving me. I am done putting in all the effort and being the one who compromises. I guess my question has two parts: AITA for not calling or AITA for not telling her why I stopped calling? Or neither?",

For example, he will be the type of person to word things like let's say taking a good professor, he will word things in ways that make it seem like, \"yeah you should take this\".

We bought the tickets, he asked if I could be the one to carpool &amp; I declined. He then said how he doesn't want to go anymore &amp; he won't be able to drive there because his Insurance is expensive(I will admit, I dont pay for my own insurance so i don't have those worries so I can't be too mad at that). \n\nHowever, I kinda got a little pissed because I DID buy a refundable ticket yet I was kinda pissed because this was literally about an hour after we all bought our tickets at the same exact time. He then proceeded to say how i'm always trying to start shit &amp; why i'm giving him crap if I can just refund the ticket. He says it's \"his choice\" to not go, which I understand but the fact he does things like that occasionally bugs me, especially since he was the one who hyped it up for everyone &amp; now is backing out because he says it will be lame. I did have another friend who ended up not wanting to even pay because it was too expensive, so then it was just me &amp; this friend I was talking about in my post but now this friend claims I'm being an asshole for not understanding \"financial situations\" even though he already BOUGHT the ticket, was the one who introduced it to us, hyped it up for days then an hour AFTER he bought it, knowing my other friend didn't go.

I didn't receive the text because I didn't have my phone on me. I realized I hadn't heard the timer go off and went downstairs to check and the bread was way overdone, just a shade below burning, and she's all like, yeah I texted you. I was livid.

    "selftext": "**Background:** A little over a year ago my dog was dying.  I lived alone with only him, dedicated all my spare time to dog rescue, and eventually stopped fostering because he didn't want to share his home with dogs; he was my best friend.  (So if you are not someone who has never been utterly destroyed by a dog dying, just assume it was a hell of a lot harder for me than you might guess.)  He developed a heart condition and was in the animal hospital for several days when it first struck, and there were many such episodes over the course of months. There was a very expensive major surgery they wanted to try that had a moderate chance of helping.  I anguished about it for a day and decided to do it.  (Although the money mattered to me, the real question was whether to put him through a major procedure that wasn't much more than 50% likely to help.)  Because of my rescue connections, hundreds of people--many of whom I have never personally met--knew about my dog and had followed my updates and photos about him for years.  When they heard I was going to pay for this procedure, they started a GoFundMe and raised $3,000 to help...which was amazing.  \n\n**The Issue:** The whole time this was going on, I was going to work full time, driving to the animal hospital to visit afterward (if he was there), spending several hours there if I could, then would come home late and write a long Facebook post to update anyone who was concerned before doing everything else an adult living alone has to do after work in a normal week.  At first, the facebook posts worked because most of my family and friends saw the feed and that saved me from having to go through the story over and over.  But after the GoFundMe started, I felt I owed it to the network of donors who had also friended me on FB to make updates, so they got really detailed about procedures, and treatment choices.  \n\nMy father, during this period, got upset because he wasn't getting regular phone updates from me on my dog's problem.   He has access to Facebook, but forgot his password and didn't feel like recovering it because he could still log in on an iPad he didn't like to use because it was old and slow.  He would try to call while I was talking to a vet or trying to write everyone else's update, and even if the time wasn't inconvenient, I didn't want to have this conversation once, twice, or more.  I put the details out there for everyone, and it was anguishing describing the condition, theories, and decisions in writing so everyone could know.  I was already exhausted, depressed, and ashamed I couldn't do more...I didn't want to have retread it all again for anyone and have to sit through 20 questions about whether we considered each absolutely obvious possibility or treatment.   \n\n**The conflict:** His point of view was that he's my father, and it's not unusual for him to want to express his support on the phone personally in a tough time...and even if I found it unusual, he deserves special treatment.   If I didn't answer one of his calls every night and repeat everything that happened with the dog that day, he felt slighted, even though absolutely no one else in my life demanded anything individual--not even the friend who set up the fund drive or any of the donors.  My point of view was that he is retired and bored and wants attention, but for the duration of this problem, he should boot up his fucking iPad and let me try to get some sleep.  So I didn't answer most calls, and when he texted, I told him the answers were on facebook and occasionally sent a new picture.   Am I the asshole?  \n\nIt's weird to go back over this after a year, but we still have this same basic fight where he wants to be needy and possessive of my time, and I'm exhausted because I work all day while he's retired but he believes he deserves more slack than I'm giving him...and I don't know where the line is.",

The same goes for all other participants, they all have their own agendas. It's important to note that everyone there has at least one PhD.\n\nI asked a few questions about the scope of the project they were working on, (in the host organization project), the reply was, \"well it kind of depends.\"I repeated the question in a different way a couple of times but the answer was the same, then he asked what I have to offer. So I gave them my pre-prepared pitch. Someone then informed me that I was not on the proper discussion thread for this and suggested I go to the more technical discussion thread, so I did, and I asked if I could post it there, and they responded go ahead, so I did. There was no response for several hours on either discussion thread, where there had been steady conversation prior on both.\n\nHere's where I should mention that my proposal is an entire worldwide monopoly on opinions. This means no other entity can exist in this market, including the project they are working on. Or anyone else's project for that matter.\n\nIf you ruled the world and decided one day, because you are a nice person, that you wish to know the desires of your people, and you really meant it, would you?\n\nA). Have people design all different kinds of Organizations that work in different ways, with different questions to answer, and then take all that and try to figure out what the people want.\n\n                   OR\n\nB). Get the best people together you can to build one system using the best agreed-upon technology,(Google search engines).\n\nThe founding fathers of the United States did not decide to \"farm out\" the voting process to a variety different organizations for this obvious reason.\n\nAll those other direct democracy initiatives require you to traverse menus, and answer questions. The limited amount of data they are working with and their use of questions, makes it unfeasible for them to use search engines.\n\nRemoving questions enables google style search engines, which then enables unlimited data, which then allows for a monopoly on the opinion market, owned by the \"people\".\n\nI'm sorry for all that material but it's important for you to understand my angle. I think if you believe in direct democracy for the people, then you should wish for the best system possible!\n\nI'm going to try and shorten this up here, several hours after I posted my plan someone tried to change the topic, and so I tried to steer it back towards some kind of response to the post I made. Both of the discussion lines completely shut down for over a week after that. \n\nSince I was not getting a response I decided to add some pressure, I began posting everything on Reddit and informed them that I was doing so. I also made a post on r/ycombinator which is the organization that's funding them. Then I made another post on r/Alexis, who is an investor in ycombinator, it was promptly removed the next day. \n\nFinally someone personal messaged me, and we started a conversation. The usual back-and-forth took place, and it ended with his agreement that a monopoly and working with search engine's would be the best case scenario, but when I asked him if I could quote him, he said no, for obvious reasons. I then asked if I could speak to the top person, Santiago Siri,(he's done a Ted talk). Several more day pass with no activity on either thread, and then Santiago addresses me. After a short discussion he informs me that he has no interest in pursuing a monopoly.\n\nSo in the end everyone agreed that a monopoly was the best option from a worldwide perspective, and that a Google style search engine is the best humans to data interface ever created. And that this was a new perspective to them that they had not considered prior, but yet within an instant they have decided they do not want to give it any more consideration.\n\nI sent apologies to each individual involved, and apologized on both conversation threads. It took another week or so before conversation there resumed.\n\nI certainly felt like an asshole, but I have a goal that I have dedicated the next two years to, so I carry-on. \n\nBy the way, I have a new sub, r/yourupinion, criticizing my plan goes over very well there, if you're interested?\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "For a little background info, I work at a fairly large Old Navy part-time to help support myself through college. Old Navy is owned by Gap, whom also owns Banana Republic. \n\nI've worked there for two years, and it has treated me well for the most-part aside from some minor annoyances. One of these are inconstant hours, It's very common for me to get 20 hours one week, then 4 the next. I've dealt with it for the most part by picking up other people's shifts, but I would still like to work more. I've expressed this very clearly with little to no effect. \n\nJust a few months ago, my general manager (Head manager in the store.) introduced the \"lead\" program. This program promised people who wanted more work in return for a bit more responsibility. Think of it as a half-step to being a manager. Naturally, I asked about it, but the first time I did they said they would get back to me on it in the next few days. They never did, I got frustrated and decided to leave it alone. \n\nAbout two months ago, my manager approached me about a lead position. At the time I was gearing up for a trip to Australia, so I turned it down this time, but said that I would gladly take it if they could wait until I was back. \n\nI got back from my trip in early January to no word about the position, I asked the same manager again, who then told me she'd talk to another more appropriate manager about getting me set up. A week or so past with no indication, so I sought out the manager myself who walked me through the details and such. He told me that my first shift doing these duties would come up on Feb 19. Surprisingly, my schedule is emailed to me and I'm listed as \"Off\" on that day.\n\nI'm pretty upset at that point, I had also found-out upon return that a good chunk of the employees in our store had also signed up to be \"leads,\" so the hours promised were likely going to be split between all of us that had applied. When the program was first announced, it was explained in a way that made it sound at-least a little exclusive, but it seems like anyone can just sign up as they please, regardless of work performance or tenure at the company. There are currently 20+. These positions are usually specific to a department, so for example you might of been the \"Lead of Men's\" or \"Lead of Fitting Room.\" But with the amount of people signing up, the titles are getting oddly specific and minuscule, leading to titles like \"Lead of Women's Shirts.\" and so forth. At this point, I feel like these titles are empty and I'm being patronized.\n\n I go speak to the manager that had given me the duties, only to get a \"Um, we'll look into it. We'll try to get you in on that day.\" without so much as a glance. His back was to me the entire time as he worked on a computer.\n\n Fast forward to today and I'm in the process of transferring to a nearby Gap. I'm expecting a \"What gives?\" from my current GM sooner or later. \n\n---\n\nAm I the asshole here? Am I projecting to much worth on myself? I get I'm a simple sales associate, but a little respect and transparency would be nice. \n\n---\n\nEdit: Added in a few details surrounding the situation. Thanks for the responses so far, I'm chalking this up as a \"kinda.\" at the moment. I'll keep you guy's thoughts and advice in mind.",

They picked a set meal that cost $20 each.\n\nWhen I wrote their bill I accidentally only wrote their total down as $40 instead on $80 as I was in a hurry and rushing around (my fault). They paid the $40 happily and stayed sitting and talking for about one minute until I realised my mistake, apologized and asked for another $40 (to bring the total to $80). I showed them the menu and the calculator to reassure them that I wasn't just trying to get more money out of them. They then proceeded to tell me that they didn't like the chicken and a majority of the dishes that were served, and wanted a discount. \n\nThey made no complaints throughout the meal, even when I asked. They also finished ALL the food. \nI refused to give them a discount as there were no complaints throughout the meal and they seemed happy when I asked. They all eventually paid. \n\nSorry for formatting I am on mobile. \n\nEdit: they knew the price was $20 per person, they chose it because it was $20. Adding as edit in case this adds relevance to whether IATA. \nThe main point I am focusing on is the fact that after about one minute of them handing me the money I realised my mistake and asked for the remaining money, they came up with a bunch of (what seemed like) excuses to avoid paying for the food, when no complaints were brought up previously. \n\nI definitely should be more careful when handling bills in the future but I thought the mistake was corrected soon enough for it not to be TOO big of an issue.\n\nI do usually bring these cases to my boss, but he was in a foul mood and I know he would have started drama (or a heated argument) that could have been avoided.\n\n\nThank you for all your answers so far!",

    "selftext": "EDIT: To be clear, everyone in this story is just a friend. I did ask the girl out once a while ago, but it's not really that relevant. I'm not worried about him hooking up with her. Him and her have never had a conversation. I'm worried about me looking bad because I think he's acting creepy. I'm not scared about him \"stealing my girl\" or anything, I just think it's a weird thing to do to a friend of mine he doesn't know.\n\n**TLDR**: I know a girl, my friend has only briefly been introduced to her. But he invited her and her friends to his birthday without asking me. I feel that's kinda inappropriate and puts pressure on her/the situation that I don't want.\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nMe and my friend (call him Alan) go to the same bar regularly, often together but sometimes without each other. There, a few months ago, I met a girl (Sally) and hooked up with her. Me and her have texted on and off since then, and hooked up a couple of times. She has two friends (Brianna and Melanie) she usually hangs out with, and usually one or both of them will be there if she is.\n\n**Alan doesn't know Sally**. I do admit they've obviously been at the bar at the same time, and had the standard ('Alan this is Sally, Sally this is Alan') introduction I've given them, but they really don't know each other. We've bumped into them at the bar or a club, but they haven't gone beyond a very short conversation at the most. I'm not sure she even knows his name. I think he's had a very short conversation here or there with Brianna and Melanie when they saw me at the bar and he was with me.\n\nAlan is aware I have a strange fragile relationship with Sally because I've told him about it. We text each other, flirt, make out alot, but don't date or really do any more than that. He understands that she will occasionally text me first and want to hang out with me, and then sometimes kiss me, but gets scared off very easily if I suggest anything like going on a date or coming home with me. I'm okay with this very casual thing we have, I'm just saying it's not as if me and her have something established or serious.\n\nHe's added them all on facebook, as he does with lots of girls I know that he even meets for two seconds. It seems that if I introduce him to a female, no matter how briefly, he adds them on facebook and comments on their posts and sometimes messages them. He's even added my friends he hasn't even met, just because he saw them on my profile and thought they were attractive. I find this creepy and inappropriate, and I've talked to him about it before. I didn't think he'd done it for a while, but obviously in this case he has. I guess it's a slight grey area because at least they go to the same bar, but it gets worse.\n\nSo this weekend is his birthday, and I just see he's done a facebook event to hang out in the city and go to a club. Fine. But he's invited Sally and her friends, and didn't mention it to me first.\n\nI said that I thought it was inappropriate of him to invite them, especially Sally, without asking me. He didn't think it was wrong, and our mutual friend who was there for the conversation thinks I'm wrong.\n\nI feel like he should have just not invited them at all. You know, like he did with my dozens of other friends he doesn't know. But he could have at least asked me if I want to bring her (I would have said no, too), and if I did, let me invite her - not just invite her without asking me. I feel that that reflects badly on me, and makes it look like I've asked him to do it, when it's in fact the opposite.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Clarified a few things.",

    "selftext": "throwaway because HELLO. DON'T HATE ME. \n\nMy friend and I live across the country from each other, and we've been planning to go to a camping festival together for a few months now. It was my idea but I am completely reliant on them since they live closer to the event and we're taking their car. We've been planning all the details together and were both clearly looking forward to the event and spending time with each other. We have a bunch of mutual friends going, but we intentionally decided not to camp with them for mostly social reasons. \n\nBUT with the event less than two weeks away, my friend asked if I would be alright with possibly giving another person (i've never met them, but they are friends with the person i'm going with and we have like a dozen mutual friends on facebook) a ride to the festival and maybe letting them camp with us if they couldn't camp with their friends. Presented like this, I said of course, because of course we can give someone a ride to the festival, and the way my friend put it made it sound like that was probably all that would end up happening. A few hours later we talk again, and now this other person \"really wants to camp with us\" so that's cool with me right? Again I said sure, because I felt like wasn't given a choice; I'm reliant on my friend for a ride/car/camp setup to/at the festival, and they put me in an uncomfortable situation that was hard to say no to without instantly being the asshole.\n\nI don't inherently have anything against camping with an additional person. Had my friend asked me before getting this other person involved so we could talk about how this would change our current plans, I don't think I would feel the way I do right now. It's clear from talking to the new person that my friend didn't explain the existing dynamic - that this new person is very much an addition to our plans, NOT a partner in organization - and I already feel like the two of them are ganging up on me to change our plans. I don't want to argue the specifics with them because it isn't about the details as much as WHAT THE FUCK OG FRIEND?\n\nPart of me thinks I am just being a dick though, that I should just accept this additional person since there is nothing I can do about it, just try to go with the flow and still enjoy the weekend. I also don't know the details of how this person was invited; did they guilt my friend into joining us, like maybe they didn't realize that they would be imposing? My friend has never been to a camping festival before and has expressed some concern over the camping aspect but I have camped at festivals before and I thought we had addressed their worries - this new person \"is a festival kid,\" did my friend invite them to help us out? or to help the other person out because they didn't have anyone to go with? did they (either my friend or the new person) not understand the gravity of this change - I could see myself not understanding this before i went to my first camping festival, the scale and whole experience is hard to communicate until you have lived it yourself. \n\nall i know is i FEEL like an asshole and a third wheel.

    "selftext": "**TL;DR: Hooked up with a chick my buddy had a crush on for the past few years, although she turned him down repeatedly. AITA?**\n\nI'll try to keep this as short as possible. Three years ago, I became a part of a group of friends that all went to a different high school than me. I became really close friends with some of them, including 'Robert' and 'Alice'. \n\nRobert had a crush on Alice for the whole time I knew them, but she has turned him down repeatedly. It came to a point when Robert would not come to gatherings if he knew Alice would be there and he asked me (and I assume others as well) not to mention her to him. \n\nThis autumn, I went off to college, but I still kept contact with both of them (and other friends) and hung out with them when I came back to my hometown. I used to have a girlfriend back there, but we broke up shortly before Christmas because of the distance. After the holiday, I went back to the college-town and cut contact with my ex to make things easier for me. \n\nIn the middle of January, Alice called me that her boyfriend dumped her and asked me to be friends with benefits. As I was still sad about my breakup, I accepted. She came to visit me recently and we fucked the whole weekend, it was awesome. \n\nI'm finally coming back to my hometown in a few days to meet with family, catch up with friends (including Robert) and also to fuck with Alice. **My first question is, am I an asshole for what I have done so far?**\n\nI feel really bad every time I talk to Robert over the phone or Facebook because of this. But I also know that he told me not to mention Alice to him ever again. All the people that know that Alice and I hooked up also know that Robert does not want to hear a single word about her, so I'm confident he won't find out unless I tell him. **My second question is, should I tell him?** \n\nTelling him would definitely ease my mind, but I also know that it could hurt him. I guess I can bear feeling bad so that he does not have to feel bad. I also don't want to risk our friendship by telling him, but on the other hand I guess that friends should be honest. If I don't tell him, will it be a white lie or will it make me an asshole? \n\nEDIT with more details, if anyone is interested:\n\n* if I were in Robert's shoes, I'd probably be upset but I wouldn't make a big deal of it. One of my best friends actually dated my high school crush for a while and I still managed to be friends with him. \n\n* when I talked to Alice after we hooked up, we actually found out that there were times when one of us was into the other, but we never knew or one of us was in a relationship then. \n\n* if it wasn't clear enough, we were both freshly out of a relationship at the time we made the arrangement. \n\n* during the time Robert had crush on Alice (it began before I knew either of them, I guess ages 14-16), she's had at least three boyfriends that I know of, so he really never had a chance. \n\n* no matter what the result of this post or the eventual outcome with my friend is, I'll continue casually hooking up with Alice until one of us finds someone more serious. Does this make me an asshole? \n\n* I'm going to see Robert probably once a month at most, Alice about the same, unless she decides to visit me in the college-town (this can't be the right expression, what's the proper one?).

For the past year, I've been driving out to their house every other weekend to check on and take care of the bees, which my father helps me with. Last year, we gathered about 100 pounds of honey from our bees, which is valued at around $10/lb.\n\nMy dad and I take turns buying equipment for the bees - wood for the beeboxes, tools to work them, bottles and labels to sell it, ect. In total, we've each spent around $400 on the hobby so far. Dad has sold around 20-30lbs of the honey to his friends and coworkers, while so far I have sold none, and taken no profits from the sales he has made.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mom called me and told me the neighbor's daughter was asking if she could be given some honey, as she's in a 4H group (activity group for kids to get involved in farming), so she could sell it as part of the group. My mom is really good friends with her mom, so of course she said yes when asked, and called me to ask if it was okay.\n\nThere is a few reasons why this isn't okay. For one, it's *illegal* for us to sell honey for resale (it's only legal for hobby beekeepers to sell honey face-to-face), for two, I've poured blood, sweat, tears, and money into this hobby, and I don't want her to give away months worth of work. I worked really, really hard to get this honey, and I haven't seen a cent yet, so I told her hell no! *Maybe* she could have some honey *at cost*, **after** I took some to a farmer's market to see how well it sells.\n\nA few weeks pass, and I find out today that mom gave her an entire *milk jug* of honey. That's over ten pounds! That's worth over one hundred dollars!\n\nI call her, and I'm pretty pissed. She didn't even tell me, I find out through facebook because I'm friends with the girl's brother. Mom says since she put some work into taking care of the bees too (she painted the hive boxes with dad a few times, stuff like that), that she feels like she deserves to have some honey too - and maybe she does, but she's never had to spend a cent on it herself, and when I told her I'm out over $400, she didn't believe me. She has no real understanding of the amount of work I've put into the hobby or the expense I've paid, and thinks she's entitled to like 1/3 of the product because she's helped out a few times. She got mad over the phone, and said \"well, bill me then!\" and hung up. \n\nSo I did, and went ahead and invoiced her for $107.17 - selling the honey at $9/lb (a bulk discount) + tax.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Mom gives away a product I created after being told not to, tells me to bill her, so I bill her.\n\n\n",

Emma had her close friend ask me if I was okay later in the week, which was nice, and I told her that I was fine and nobody need worry.\n\nWe all went to a party about a week or so after this, got fairly drunk, and I got together with a girl who we are both friends with [also 19F], who I shall call Olivia. I was very good friends with her before this. We continued to see each other in the next few weeks, leading to now. \n\nOlivia and I (perhaps a fuck up on my part) decided to keep it quiet amongst our friends, and tried not to tell anyone about our arrangement. We were not sure how long we would want to keep seeing each other and didn't want to 'rock the boat' in the friendship group, especially since Emma and I had just broken up.\n\nEmma finds out pretty quickly after her previously mentioned close friend somehow found out (not sure how) that we were making out at the party. She is quite distressed by this. I didn't find this out until she confronted me about all this recently.\n\nWe continue to see each other privately, and admittedly sneak off together after nights out (we are students). \n\nAll was well until I got horribly drunk last week. We all went to a bar, where I arrived late. I was sort of pleased to find out that Emma has found some guy to pair off with for the night, as this makes me feel a little more justified in seeing Olivia. A few of us went back to someone in the groups flat, it was a group of about 5 of my closer friends (including Olivia, not including Emma or her closer friends). I let it slip when I was blacked out that Olivia and I were seeing each other (as she told me the next day as she filled me in). I woke up very embarrassed and swearing off the drink as per usual. I had however allowed our arrangement to become *public knowledge*.\n\nEmma found out about this pretty quickly, and she later tells me she feels horrible. She says when she confronts me about it by text that I was wrong to hide it from her if I wanted to spare her feelings, made her \"feel like shit\", \"this has really changed my perception of you\". I keep my cool here and don't share with her my actual opinion on the topic of her involvement.\n\nNow I shall show my bias. In my opinion, she has nothing to do with this, it's not her problem, she isn't my problem. She broke up with me, I don't believe in a grace period between relationships, I don't think she had a 'right to know'. In my view, **I owe her nothing at all**. I hold these opinions regretfully, because before this I really rather liked her.\n\nSorry for rambling, so here's a **TL;DR: Emma breaks up with me, all good. I hook up with Olivia, kept it a secret, Emma not so happy when she finds out a few weeks down the line.**\n\nThank you, I will try to answer questions quickly.",

So I went to this party as her date (at a bar we are in college) and we were having a good time. I ended up blacking out heavily, lights out no memories of the rest of the night. I woke up the next morning to a kid from down the hall yelling at me to wake up and go get my phone from the significant other, I'll call her Sarah from here on. The kid from my hall left my room and I pulled the covers off and hopped out of bed to find all I was wearing was socks and a condom. At my feet were girls clothes scattered all over the floor, boots etc. Sarah had been planning on spending the night so I figured that it was her and so I just took off the conform threw on clothes and went to where the kid told me to meet Sarah and get my phone. The thought did not occur to me about why she would have my phone, it was 9am at this point and I was still hammered. I saw Sarah and she gave me my phone and told me we needed to talk. She was giving me a hard to for getting to drunk when I was supposed to be her date, which was fine and I totally understood it and apologized. Then I asked her if she wanted to come back to my room and get her clothes that she left. She looked at my and told me that she was with me at the bar and I was way blacked so she was walking back with me and I told her I needed to go to the bathroom, and then she said I just never came back. She had my phone so she couldn't call me or anything. So she was not the one that I had sex with and she was pissed bc I basically cheated. So I kinda freaked out when she told me it wasn't her and went back to my room and checked out the clothes. I thought I might recognize who's they were so I went and I talked to her. I asked her what she had done that night and she told me she didn't even go out. I just said alright and as I turned to leave I saw her roommate.. wearing my shirt. I hardly have talked to this girl and don't remember anything that happened. It's not like I texted her trying to hook up, remember Sarah had my phone. I somehow went from the bathroom to having sex with a random girl. So am I the asshole and should Sarah be mad at me or is it not my fault bc I don't remember it and didn't want it to happen ",

    "selftext": "So for context, I'm twenty, my sister is fifteen. I live at home whilst going to college and working, sister is a high school student. \n\n----\n\nHistorically in our household my parents never cooked, and the majority of the time we would grab fast food or order pizza. Over the past year or so I've been trying to shift away from that, fast food is expensive and unhealthy, and I'm in college trying to save money, so I started learning to cook. At first I would only cook for myself, but once I started showing off my creations to my parents, my dad agreed to start buying groceries more routinely in exchange for cooking dinner for everyone whenever I had the time. \n\nOver the course of me teaching myself, my sister has decided to join in too, she's started cooking basic things like Tuna Helper and instant Mashed Potatoes. I'm super proud of her for taking action, but the thing is...She never cleans up after herself, leaving stacks of dishes piled up for days, more than once has she left mashed potatoes just sitting in a pot on a counter for 3-4 days at a time. \n\nI know actually, because at first I made a joke about it, I would send little vlogs to my mom about it saying stuff like \"Day 3, still no sign of pots and pans being cleaned.\" \n\nFor further context, I started getting into habit of cleaning up my dishes immediately after using them. I used to do the same exact thing as her, and she would take the time to call my dad and tell him to tell me to clean the dishes. I took the advice/took action and followed through. \n\nAnyway, I've been on an absolute roll cooking wise lately, most of the stuff I'm doing have been really nice hits with the rest of the family, getting to a point where I cook 5-6 a week. Last night I made dinner, but left a bit of batter in a Tupperware bin last night. (Important in a second.) Acknowledging all the cooking I've been doing lately, my mom asked my sister to do the dishes this time to give me a break. I get a call earlier from my Dad, who's pretty upset, saying that my sister called him again, and that I should clean out the grease, batter, etc. from the pans once I'm finished with them. \n\nI got off the phone and was kinda heated myself, I've been studying, working, and cooking my ass off lately in addition to other household chores out of the goodness of my heart and was feeling a bit unappreciated, especially since my sis has done much worse than a bit of batter in a bowl.  I show my sister one of these vlogs (which were previously between me and my mom only.) clearly showing footage of her dirty stuff followed by a date and she freaks out and starts throwing things at me. \n\n\n\n\n==\n\nEverything's cooled off now and we've apologized to each other, but I'm still curious.\n\n----\n\nP.S. \n\nLast time I was here, I was angry with my situation at work. A bit of an update, I took my asshole status to heart and decided to talk to my boss directly instead of being passive. It turns out there was an open door policy I had no clue existed. I voiced my concerns and they totally understood where I was coming from. I'm working much more, have a position training new people, and I'm having a better experience there overall.

It was a Sunday brunch shower. I receive a call from my sister telling me my grandfather has had a massive stroke and is in ICU. This was a Wednesday. I inform my sister I will be up as soon as possible. \n\nI inform my mother. (parents divorced and she happen to be at my house.) I inform my SO. I also mention that they want me up on Thursday. (the next day, he isn't expected to live through the night.) \n\nMy grandmother AND my father call me the next day.(side note: \"father\" is the sperm donor that signed his rights away. He did not raise me, and we have not spoken in over 5 years.) They say they are in a \"holding pattern\" until the test results come back, until they no how much of his brain is dead, until they decide to place a breathing tube or not, etc. Grandfather has lived through the night but they aren't sure how much longer he can hold on.\n\n(Side note: while my bio father didn't raise me, my adoption paperwork did not sever grandparents rights. Grandfather visited me often. Emailed me all the time. Taught me how to drive a standard. Taught me how to drive in snow. Gave me my first car. He also paid for half my tuition while I was in college.)\n\nI break down at dinner that night. SO books me a ticket for Friday afternoon at dinner. I had told my father and my grandmother I had social obligations to meet on Sunday, I would be there as soon as I could but I could not meet social obligations and get a flight out until Monday, putting me bedside Monday afternoon at the earliest. (baring no northern snow storms.)\n\nFriday I take a half day of work. Inform my boss I am leaving and will be gone for a while. SO gets a call from my future mother in law asking why I can't stay till Sunday.\n\nI leave Friday afternoon. So's father (sibling of the aunts hosting) calls SO and informs him I am \"rude, ungrateful, not understanding, and all around a horrible person he doesn't want to marry.\" So's mother joins and asks why I couldn't wait until after the shower.\n\nI was away during all this. I Skype in during the shower, greeted and thanked everyone for their attendance. I watched as SO opened our presents, had a friend take detailed notes, and wrote thank yous to all that attended as well as all that brought gifts. \n\nSo's father that had so much to say arrived in town that Friday. (the day I left.) However, he could not stay for the shower, nor did he purchase a gift, because he had to fly to New York for Hamilton on Broadway that Sunday. \n\nSo's mother attended the shower, I spoke with her over Skype. But apparently I was not \"gracious enough.\" \n\nSO joined me in northern destination on Monday. Grandfather passed on Superbowl Sunday. The last day he didn't have a ventilator and could talk was Wednesday. (we left Thursday at 4am)\n\nSo I leave it up to you. Am I the asshole? ",

    "selftext": "We\u2019ve just dodged the bullet of needing to file bankruptcy - we really don't have the money. My SO has recently picked up a 2nd job..Saturday night shifts at a restaurant so that we could be a little more comfortable cash wise. Meanwhile, his younger brother (25yrs) hasn't worked AT ALL this past year+ while living at his parent's and/or girlfriend's place. Every time he comes over he drinks our beer and smokes our pot - he's always empty handed. My boyfriend picks up the tab every time his brother is around, because he wants to and I get that to an extent. I just feel that this guy is lazy and that his entire family enables him. \n\nWhich is why I got so pissed last night when my SO told me that he's given his brother over $200 these past few months - for what?!?! So that he could take his girlfriend out on dates and Valentines dinners and what-have-you. Every weekend my SO misses out because he's working a 2nd job.. and with my school/work it's hard to find time together, and he\u2019s supplementing his brother's good time? This brother has frequently asked the older siblings for $ to go on trips to Chicago, hotel rooms, and bachelor parties. It's insane to me. And really pisses me off that it's just so easy for him to come by money. All he's gotta do is come over, smoke some pot, drink some beers and ask for a handout.  It's my boyfriend\u2019s money, I suppose. But we live together &amp; I\u2019ve spent so much energy helping my SO finally sort a way out of major debt. Their sister is the most well-off in the family and she can afford to put-up/hookup the brother like she does. I'm more of a tough love personality and don't really sympathize for a 25yr. old, able bodied dude unwilling to work for his weekend cash. My SO told me I needed to end the conversation - but I've got to wonder here, am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend is working (two jobs) his way out of debt. His younger brother (25) is able bodied and unwilling to get a job for over a year now. This brother has no problem asking for cash handouts to take his girlfriend on dates, buy gifts and go on weekend trips. Apparently, my SO doesn\u2019t have a problem being the source for such handouts and I\u2019m pissed about it. AITA?",

    "selftext": "I'm sorry that I'm about to raise the dreaded topic of **feminism**, but here goes! We don't have to argue about the principles, just whether or not this is an asshole move on my part.\n\nI proposed to my girlfriend last year and we're getting married in the summer. We've talked a lot between ourselves about the traditions associated with marriage, and the one balk at the most is maintaining the paternal line of surnames as standard. I don't think it's OK to have such a gender lopsided and overwhelmingly adhered to tradition which is based in a historical subjugation of women, and I love the idea of this being a symbol to my hypothetical future daughters (and sons!) that they can do whatever they want in life. I don't think that merging surnames or double-barrelling does enough to move towards equality. I'd prefer a society in which surnames are kept on a 50/50 basis by both genders. Realistically, though, I just think that people should have the choice to do whatever they want with their surnames.\n\nMy parents don't concur with my opinion on this. They are concerned that people will think I'm trying to sever ties to my family, or that I prefer my fiance's family to my own. They say that this will ruin the wedding for them and embarrass them in front of their whole family, implying that they were in some way bad parents to me (**they weren't!**). My mum in particular takes it as a personal insult. I've tried to explain my reasoning and ask if they'd say the same things if my sister took someone else's surname, but I haven't been very successful. \n\nThe more it goes on, the more it becomes clear that they are more upset than I initially realised. At her most angry, my mum has said that doing this would distance her from me, my fiance and my children in the future, and that if the topic comes up at the wedding she would struggle not to cry or walk out. She keeps asking me why I want her to be upset on my wedding day just to make an ideological point, and I don't really have an answer.\n\nIf people want to argue about my reasoning for why surnames should pass down 50/50, I'm happy to do that, but that's not what I'm really asking. My question is: Am I The Asshole for doing something which is clearly upsetting my parents and risks distancing my new family from my old one?",

    "selftext": "can someone please help me out with my ex\n This story takes place over 3 years I met this girl when i was 16, she just move to town and was in a few of my classes. We ended up talking a little bit and ended up dating, she was my first real girlfriend and i was her first real boyfriend. her name was lily and she was such a sweet girl but had a lot of problems going on in her life, her father was physically and verbally abusive and her mother was a drug/ booze addict who was no help. The first time i met the mom she was had climbed up a tree saying people were trying to take pictures of her.  Lily would grab to me, she had no one else in her life to help her. i felt so bad for her and really cared about her and wanted to help her so bad. everytime something happened (which was daily) shed call me crying her eyes out begging for help. she had a lot of depression issues and anxiety issues and i had to leave class a few times just to go outside and calm her down. Months went by and everyday it was something new, she was becoming very depressed and cutting herself and i did not know what to do. I began to feel responsible for this girl, it was stressing me out so bad that I couldn't sleep for days. She loved me a ton, she would go out of her way to bring me presents, and would surprise me all the time. The issue is, i really cared about this girl, she was such a good person and didn't deserve any of this crap, i wanted to help her so bad. But after 4 months of dating, I couldn't take it, i broke up with her. Not even a week later she called me yelling that she needed me. that she had thrown up everyday and cutting herself since i left her, It made me feel sick, i felt like i had added to this horrific pain to her and got back together with her. i want to add too that there was plenty of good times, but it was difficult to be with her sometimes because i felt trapped. I never cheated on her, but she was very possessive and hated that i sometimes went to parties and would become mad at me for going. she had social anxiety and hated anything to do with substances (which i completely understand due to parents, i didn't drink or smoke weed much at the time anyways) A few months went by of again similar situations, and again i couldn't take it anymore, i felt like i had no choice but to break up with her and it killed me doing it, a few days later i get a suicide text, I try to text her back but get no response. I drive over to her house as fast as i could and find the mother drunk and lily on the ground not conscious with pills and vomit everywhere. I picked her up and drove her to the hospital and sat by her until she came to. she had taken a bunch of different pills, luckily she was ok, but they checked her into a mental hospital after that. i began tracking down people who had been admitted to that same hospital and asked them how it worked. i felt responsible for this ( even though i probably shouldn't have but i was 17) one of my closest family members passed away from cancer during this time and i was just a mess. I hadn't seen lily for 2 months, i was worried sick about her, every night i felt like i was going to throw up. after about 2 months of not seeing her, i began talking to this other girl that i had a crush on since middle school. We ended up talking at a party and exchanged numbers. I started to like her and ended up asking her to prom and she said yes. I had no idea when lily would be back, all my friends had dates and i didn't know if lily would be back. Plus at this time i started to lose feeling for her, and i liked this other girl more. Turned out it was just lust for this other girl and me latching on to something that wasn't real for the sake that i was miserable. Lily came back right before prom and i told her how i met this other girl and it pissed her off a lot. This is where i begin to hate myself, i wish i could go back in time and change some things here but what happened happened. I told lily id still be her friend and i'd be there for her for anything. We ended up having sex one day and then things got messy and gray. We were getting back together and breaking up every 4 days. Prom went by and i told her i wouldn't hook up with the girl i was going with. she didn't believe me and was very insecure and ending up hooking up with her date and called me late that night crying. After a few more fights and messy things, we ended up getting back together right before summer. Her going away to the mental hospital helped a lot, we were able to get her dad away from her for the most part and her mom was trying to get better. These were the best days of our relationship, that summer was incredible. She was doing great and i started to really like her alot. She still had some underlying issues but so do we all. After about 7 more months of dating i could honestly say i loved her. We still fought sometimes and there was still some dysfunctionality ( as in wed get in a fight and break up and then call each other apologizing). \nThis next part is what killed our relationship. \nMy friend group and one of my friends inside my friend group is dating a girl and her friends and my friend group would often hang out. I didn't like any of these girls, in fact i came close to hating them. They drank all the time and threw up and were gross. Lily would always find out when i was hanging with my friends and these girls and it would drive her crazy and she would become so mad at me. She didn't believe me that i hated them, she thought i really liked them and enjoyed drinking with them. Which was not the case at all. I used to beg my friends to not invite them because 1. I didn't enjoy their company and 2. I knew it'd upset lily. \nI understand why she didn't want me with them. Lily had this idea of me that i loved partying and i think she felt jealous of those girls. She probably was also worried that something similar would happen like with the girl i met at the party when she was away the mental hospital. We began fighting a ton about this, i tried so hard to tell her that i would never want any of those girls. This went on for months, we both eventually couldn't take it and broke up 3 months before college. I loved her so much, but we were fighting so damn much over this stupid thing. My friends were always with these girls, even though i hated them. We still talked all summer and even had a few last date things before she went to college and they were awesome. She left for college about 7 hours away and i stayed home commuting to a school cause i wanted to save money for student loans. She told me to never talk to her again 3 days after she got to college and blocked me on everything. I tried my best to reach out but nothing. I was fine for the first few weeks, then i began to realize what i lost. How much i missed her. It started to drive me crazy that she was at a school with 80% guys. I started smoking weed and drinking everyday, i couldn't eat, i couldn't leave bed, i was losing weight and throwing up everyday. I'm a little better now but this has been going on for almost 8 months now of me being like this. She texted me the other day how i'm a terrible person and that if i ever try to reach out to her again she's going to get a restraining order on me. She has a new boyfriend and i'm happy for her and all but like holy shit it just deteriorating me, i haven't been going to class and can barely leave bed. I really don't know what to do. Any help would be much appreciated. \n",

    "selftext": "I have been downsizing and that turned into selling a lot of my things online because they're excellent condition, I just have no need or want from them. I found a website where the people who buy from you can review you, and up until now, I've received nothing but glowing reviews. \n\nThis one lady wanted to buy 10 of the items I had for sale, which should have came to a total of $60 had they went for my asking price but she asked me for a deal. I have no problem with that, I told her I would let her have all the items for $30 and to please let me know if this price worked for her. She told me that it did work for her. She was extremely nice and friendly the entire time we were messaging online about the items and she was very happy with price I was offering. There was 5 pictures of each item and I made sure that she was happy with these items and really wanted to purchase them.\n\nThen came yesterday when it was time for her to purchase the items. She arrived at my apartment building and buzzed me. She was for some reason laughing when she asked for me and told me she was here for the items. My BF helped me carry down some of the items and to hold doors open for me. I approached the lady and we handed her the items. She looked them over , I asked her if she was satisfied with the items in person and if she was still ok with the price. She handed me the money, my boyfriend and I told her to have a great day and she walked back to her car.\n\nSeveral hours after this transaction took place, at 11:30 pm, I get a message from this lady: \n\n\"Hello. Thank you for reviewing me as a great buyer. I was absolutely unimpressed with the price that I paid for these items or the way that you brought some highly aggressive back up to the sale. The fact that you brought back up made me extremely uncomfortable, I did not know who this man was, I was shaking! I did not like the fact that the both of you practically slapped me in the face, grabbing for your money. If it was just you and I standing there, I never would have paid $30 for 10 items, I would have paid $3 at most. I will not write you a bad review if I can come out on Sunday and get $27 of my money back.\" \n\nI wrote back saying: \n\n\"Hello, there were the maximum amount of allowed pictures posted for every one of the items that you purchased and I had discussed this price with you more than once before we met up for this exchange, you agreed upon that price, and did so again in person. For 10 , decent sized and excellent condition items, I think that $30 is a fair price. If you didn't agree, you had several opportunities to let me know this so I have no idea where this is coming. I am very sorry that you feel like my boyfriend made you uncomfortable. His purpose for being there was not, in anyways meant to cause you discomfort or to be any form of back up, he simpler was helping me carry the items and to hold open doors for me. You are right, I should have mentioned that he was likely to be coming down with me, I am deeply sorry about this. \" \n\nShe then sent me a flurry of over 30 messages about how I am rude and disrespectful , she knows my other reviews are fake because I am not that perfect, she's going to come to apartment building and buzz me until I give her money back, she is going to phone the police because I stole her money when she didn't really want these items, she is going to report me to the website, she is going to sue me, I am an awful person, I am aggressive , I am going to hell and karma will get me for this... \n\nMy boyfriend told me to not respond to her and to just phone the police for harassment if she comes here and starts constantly buzzing me. I haven't responded anymore but I feel like an asshole, should I?\n\nTLDR; sold several items to someone on a selling website, they agreed to the price several times through messages and in person. Then the lady messages me later that night expressing her unhappiness and wanting her money back, I polite apologize to her and explain that she agreed to the price. She threatens to phone police and sue.\n",

    "selftext": "Okay so just a note before I start, this happened years ago around when GTA Online first came out. Myself and the guy involved in this story are good friends now, although when this happened he was pretty pissed for months. I've been thinking back to this and honestly can't decide which of us were the asshole in this situation so I figured I'd get a third party's opinion.\n\nAlright, so like I said this happened around when GTA Online first came out and at that time there were **lots** of cheats/hacks/exploits going around. My friend took part in these exploits where as I did not, the specific things he did were:\n\n* Join a hacked lobby so he was level 152 (incredibly high, I was only level 14)\n\n* Got someone to hack him in tonnes of money\n\n* Did a glitch to get a tank as an \"owned\" vehicle (this should not be possible, it meant he could respawn it cheaply and if you destroyed the tank you were penalized and even sometimes kicked for destroying someones personal vehicle)\n\nNow I didn't mind him having all of these glitched/hacked stuff, I personally didn't take part in it but it never bothered me that he cheated because it didn't really effect me. Usually we played together just messing around in free roam (we were in a group of 5-6 usually if it's of any relevance). We did usually try and fuck with each other all in good spirited fun, blowing up each others cars, sniping each other off rooftops etc. We did this almost every night.\n\nNow, the problem came in one night in particular, I can't remember what it was but I was trying to do something, most likely trying to earn money by robing shops (like I said I didn't cheat so I was usually low on cash while the rest of the group had more money than they could possibly spend). The friend who glitched/cheated earlier decided to fuck with me, now normally this would be fine but this one instance really pissed me off. Instead of just blowing up my car or killing me once or twice he continually killed me/destroyed my car.\n\nWhenever he destroyed my car I have to spend about 2 minutes getting it back and he takes a penalty of ~$1000 (which didn't matter to him because he had so much money). He was using his tank to kill me, which like I said he glitched to get insured, so if I blew it up I lost ~$1000 (which at the time would have been like 1/10 my money gone each time). The first few times I didn't mind but after a while I was just like \"Dude, stop. I'm trying to earn money because I'm poor as fuck and I can't even fight back because your tank is insured and I'd just lose all the money I just earned). He was just following me around wherever I went and killed me, if I tried switching lobbies he'd just join that lobby and keep killing me again. \n\nSo after about 20 minutes of this I was just like \"Dude, seriously. If you don't stop killing me I'm going to report you.\" He just kind of shrugged it off, after 2/3 more times of me reassuring him I was going to report him he didn't seem to care. I did report him and even told him I reported him and he was just like \"Na, you didn't\" I logged off around that point because I was pretty pissed off after having losing literally all my money.\n\nThe next day I log on to find out he's not playing in our regular group and he unfriend me. I found out from the other guys that turns out they do read reports, and because I reported him for \"hacking/exploiting\" they looked at his account and seen \"Oh, he has a lot of stuff he really shouldn't have.\" he was banned for about 30 days, when he was unbanned **ALL** of his stuff was gone. He still had his character but he was reset to level 1, his bank account balance was $0 and his apartment and all his cars (including the tank) were removed. \n\nI know that technically yea he did deserve to be reset, but I still felt like an asshole because he had invested weeks into that character and he also could no longer get the tank. (They patched the glitch but a lot of people still had them because they were reported and thus never reset.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSorry if this was a bit long winded, but I wanted to get in as much information as I could about the incident.\n\nAITA for getting him banned?",

Recently my boyfriend and I got in a fight because he wanted to hang out with some friends of mine when I wasn't around, at first I was uncomfortable because I felt it was important we each have our own friends so that if we ever break up it doesn't end up one of us (me) losing my entire support system because in the past even when he cheated on me, he somehow convinced our friends I was in the wrong and I was the asshole. Eventually though I said it was no big deal that I thought it was more an issue of having shitty friends vs. not having shitty friends and that if he wanted to hang out with them that was fine with me. Today we were planning on going out with friends and all of a sudden he was worried about me having my own friends. Red flag. I could tell it was something more than that and eventually he was accusing me of talking shit about him and making him sound like a manipulative dick when really he wasn't. He demanded to see my phone at which point I said no because you're only trying to fight and nothing productive can come of this, you're welcome to look at my phone anytime once you calm down, there is no password and I have nothing to hide. After he pouted and accused me of cheating I finally gave it to him anyway and as expected he said I was trying to make everyone think he's a \"bipolar manipulative asshole\" though the things I said were literally just exact quotes or events that actually happened with no analysis or anything so I feel like if the truth comes off as you being a manipulative ass, maybe you're being a manipulative ass? Also I very clearly included things taking responsibility for my own fuck up because obviously most fights aren't entirely at the fault of one person. He then decided he didn't want me to talk to my friends about our fights at all which I'm not sure but I think is really unhealthy, I need help from a third party to know whether or not I'm crazy, like is telling my friends about problems talking shit or is that a healthy thing to do?",

Made it clear I wasn't interested, but he wouldnt let off. So. Instead of just blocking him like any normal person would, I felt kind of spiteful, because after a while of this constant bs from people on online dating sites, you get irritated. \n\nBasically, I work at a car dealership. And we've learned that when customers use the Truecar app, their info gets sent to every dealer within 50 miles of their zip code that sells the model of vehicle they want. And I've used it to prank my friends, but never to this extent. \n\nBasically, I took this guys number, and gave him a fake name and email, and submitted it to every single dealership in town. Sent in an inquiry for every brand of vehicle. And on some even put that I didn't want to be called at all after 10am, only call before 10am. \n\nSo, this guy is going to get probably about 100 calls on Monday from different car dealerships across the city asking \"Dick\" when he can come in to meet with their designated true car advisor. \n\nNow that its done and over with, I'm feeling a bit guilty, and definitely like an asshole.

Her doctors said she needed to have a procedure to remove the baby, at this point it would have been traumatic for her to \"eject\" the baby on her own.(That was the term the doctors used not me.) My wife's mother decides to show up to show her some support. Her mother is a bit odd which I've excepted. Now, when she shows up, she brings her flea ridden dog to our home. I'm already not happy about this, fleas can easily infest a home and we already have enough to worry about. So today was the day of the procedure. My wife is in her hospital bed getting prepped for the procedure, and her mother keeps making these obnoxious, jokes trying to make the nurses laugh. My wife is used to her mother, but I'm not. I didn't find the time and place very appropriate for her jokes and comments. I know we all grieve at different paces but this woman looked and me and noticed I wasn't laughing when she made her comments. Then she slaps me on the back and yells \"cheer up!\" It took all my will not to tell her to leave the room and wait in the lobby. She leaves during the procedure to walk her dog, and when she returns she says that we may have a bug problem at the house. I asked why and she raised her pant legs up to show me that her legs were covered in bites. She didnt even stop to think MAYBE its her dog that she slept with last night that's infested with fleas! I'm going to ask her to leave once we all wake up later on today cause were all pretty tired, especially my wife. So....Am I the ass hole?\n\nUPDATE: The problem worked out everyone, she is leaving. I just wanted to know if I was being an ass hole for how I was feeling. I thank everyone that listened and shared their condolences. ",

    "selftext": "Backstory: My daughter has a neurological issue which has caused her some struggles. She misses school sometimes for hospital stays (usually only 2-3 days at a time now). She has some motor delays and speech impediments. She has absence and focal seizures that are easily mistaken for just zoning out or just being disruptive. I am very (possibly overly) sensitive to feeling like people underestimate her or see the worst in her. I tend to get upset with her school for how they grade or fail to reward her. \n\nTwo recent examples: she got a horrible report card this semester. She was marked 'does not meet standard' on things I know she has down cold. In the conference, the teacher said flat out that they marked her down if she didn't say the exact word correctly because of her speech impediments. So she can identify a trapezoid and a sphere, but since she says crapasoy and spear, no credit. She can tell you if you are making the correct blended sounds, but since she cannot produce blended sounds like tr/pr she is marked down as not recognizing them and is essentially failing kindergarten- again. They already held her back. They also would cut her off if she did not answer within a few seconds, despite knowing and acknowledging that she has frequent absence seizures. \n\nAlso, they gave awards to kids who made 100 days with no tardies or unexcused absences. She had neither, but they still did not give her an award. When asked afterwards, it was because she had no unexcused absences but since she had spent a total of 11 excused days (1 for a socio-psych eval the school requested, the rest in-hospital with extra homework to make up for what she missed in class), they said it just wasn't fair to the kids who saw her miss so many days, but the teachers son who was hospitalized for a few days more did get an award.\n\n\nThis particular example: My daughter loves the science fair and worked like a dog on her project. She ended up being the only kid in her grade to complete one. She was awarded second place for her grade. I asked the admin about it later when I returned to pick up the project at the end of the fair and was told since it was a 'solid B grade project' they had made the call that it was more appropriate to give her a second place and just not give out a kindergarten first place at all. I am livid. I feel like they'd rather throw the ribbon in the trash than reward my girl. On the other side, my daughter is thrilled to have won a ribbon and she still qualified to move on to the county fair. She is proud of her second place. I don't want to diminish that for her, but I think giving her second when she was literally the only one in her category is utter bullshit. AITA for wanting to take the admin to task over ribbon color?\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everybody. After having others in my life try to convince me, it took coming to a spot where anonymous internet users were freely encouraged to tell me I was being the asshole to come to terms with the fact that I have allowed myself to be gaslighted by the school. They put so much effort into convincing me I was just over-protective and not savvy and impartial enough to get the bigger picture. I know that letting them plant doubts about my instincts has been to my daughter's detriment. Her dad and I have been planning and trying to make some big decisions over the weekend. We have called for an IEP meeting because it is the easiest way to get all the major players in this debacle in one spot. We have reached out to advocacy groups in Oakland and Sacramento because we can't find one closer yet (we are in one of the more rural spots in Nor Cal). Her dad is absolutely dead set against her going to the other kindergarten available. He wants to make this school work, but based on the advocacy groups suggestions he is also willing to consider homeschooling. I don't think this is an ideal option for her, but supplemented with things like dance classes, T-Ball, etc. for socializing I think we could make it work. There is a small local paper (about 1500 circulation, but like a rabid dog with a bone, and they have squared off with the school system before) and her dad knows people involved with Chico States' Orion, but we won't take that step until we meet with an advocate for some guidance and to lay out the paper trail we have. It's hard to face up to what I've protested but ultimately let them get away with, but it is over now. ",

    "selftext": "Back in 2nd year of college, I lived with a girl, Gabby, for a year who I'd met in our dorms. We became friends but she was a bit of a spoiled princess, which bugged me, and very innocent.\n\nWe lost touch for years and she just recently added me on social media and left a strange comment. But I admit, I would say things that I prob shouldn't have to her: When I was leafing through her high school yearbook I condescendingly said: \"Gabby, when did boys start noticing you?\"\n\nWhen we were at a bar, I would try to stir shit, telling Gabby that a random girl at the bar was pointing at her and talking crap, muttering \"that girl has big tits and a flat ass\" about Gabby, when that didn't happen. I loved watching her get worked up over it.\nOne time when she was changing in front of me, I laughed at her body and said \"You've got the ass of a 7 year old boy!\"\n\nI'm now wondering if I was too harsh... my other gf's and I joke around a lot, but Gabby never stood up for herself. She had introduced me to one of her new friends, Tiffany, who not only moved in with us, but I ended up becoming really close to, and the 2 of us kinda ganged up on Gabby. I resented the fact that Gabby's dad was a doctor and paid for everything of hers, and that she tiny with a perfect body (huge boobs though no butt), while I was flat and had an occasionally abusive dad.\n\nShit hit the fan a year later and Tiffany &amp; I ended up having a huge falling out and stopped talking. So I ended up sending Gabby an email a year or 2 later sending a half assed apology, which she accepted, and told her she could have one of my pets who was more connected to Gabby than me, who I couldn't give attention/affection to. Gabby accepted and told me that I'd need to bring all of the cat's updated vet info, and she invited me to her new brand new condo that she secretly got while living w Tiff &amp; I. **Her intention was to leave Tiff &amp; I stranded as she shopped for a new condo behind our backs, and was going to move out without telling us, to leave us stranded/high &amp; dry That's pretty petty, passive-aggressive and catty, don't you think?**\n\nAnyway, we lost touch for YEARS after that but she found me on social media and added me, and I did the same. She looks good, happy, is traveling around the world a lot, doesn't look like she has kids or a husband. I just had a baby so I'm posting nonstop pics of her. Gabby just recently sent me a private message saying \"i'm so glad to see you're doing well...I remember back in the day you were pretty broken :( .. good to see youve picked yourself up. I'm sure having a baby girl softened you up- looks like youve come a long way from cruel andrea!\"\n\ndoesnt that make HER passive aggressive and sounding like she's hung up in the past?What does she mean by that? Implying that she thinks I wasn't happy when we were in contact?\n\nAnd do you think the stuff I said and did to her back in the day was at all bad? I feel like it was mostly college girl dumb behavior. thoughts?\n\ntl;dr: An old friend (f/34) from college who I (f/34) bullied just recently added me to social media and commented on a pic of me saying \"so great to see youre doing well, i remember you were pretty broken/cruel, having a baby must have made you softer.!\" Is she implying that she doesn't think I was happy when we were in contact? I used to make comments about her body like telling her she had a 7 year old boys ass; asking when boys started noticing her and I'd try to stir shit by telling her people at bars were criticizing her looks. Was that horrible of me? We lived together when I did this but the whole time she was secretly condo-shopping and intended to leave me stranded to find a roomie without giving me notice.",

E decides to drive and I let him, the drive back is 8 minutes. D tells me we should get an uber Bc we have both been drinking. I then remember that she didn't drink and ask her if she can drive us back, no. She says no because she's scared of driving downtown, she doesn't know the way, and is afraid with the one ways and the trains in the road(some lanes are public transit only). I live and deliver in the downtown area so I know every possible way back to my apartment and which lanes to stay on and off. I ask her again because I don't want to leave my car and have to buy another trip back there before parking fares start at 8, she refuses. I'm like \"ok E is driving\", I know he is good to drive. She then looks and me and tells me \"you hate me.\" and proceeds to ignore us. So I tell her,\" Look! You haven't had anything to drink tonight and you want us to pay for a ride back at 2x the rate with surge prices, I know the way and I know how to navigate through downtown. You're being really selfish right now.\" She gets even more mad and ignores us the whole night after that. I let E drive us home. Was I out of line to yell at her?

(A little extra information: I used to sight read when I played the saxophone and I struggled with playing notes below the staff even when knowing the notes just repeat.) I'm getting notes wrong left and right shes saying \"wrong\" \"what?\" \"that's not right\" as I'm struggling to play, you know not really helping but just making it more frustrating. I say I don't want to play anymore. She gets upset and as usual goes straight to her social media, I'm upset now cause instead of talking to me about it she's on Facebook and Snapchat. I get up and let her know I'm going to the bathroom I come back and ask her for the room key she says its in the locker I grab the room key and head back. We are leaving now and she stops me and ask me and head into another piano room and tries to talk about it I try explain to her everything from how she just seemed bothered with helping me and what not. She points out she wasn't bothered with helping me, and she wasn't trying to make it frustrating. I say okay with her interrupting every sentence and vice versa, she starts talking over me i ask her to listen i start to talk about how she isn't listening to what I'm saying and she gets up and says I need to go to work and starts trying to walk past me i put my arm out to stop her and she just tries to bulldoze me so this time i grab her by the waist and just start pushing her back she says why are you doing this I say because you think its okay to do to me (childish and dumb i know). she tries it again this time pushing me with force I'm only 140 and shes 200 (not an excuse just so you guys know) I get more upset I push back thinking shes trying to grab me by the shirt and push me which she did do I push her again (During this moment she said she was falling which I didn't notice) and shes falling I tried pulling her but fell down with her. She broke out in tears kicked me and said I pushed her to the floor.(It wasn't my intention, but it did happen.) Now she's extremely pissed off at me. (If your commenting please quote what makes me the asshole.) Things to point out I did not I repeat did not put my hands on her in a aggressive way. I feel like this entire explanation is being misunderstood.",

    "selftext": "Update: Thank you so much for the responses! I went and apologized to dad for being an ass. Mom's already in bed, so I'll talk to her tomorrow.\n\nI (M20) live at my parents' house, and my mom usually drives me to uni (she works nearby). The last two days I overslept, and my mom had to wait for me to get ready (10-15 minutes). I often have problems getting up in the morning, but I'm hardly ever late by more than a minute or so, and I've started getting up at 7 am every school day to try and get a more stable circadian rhythm.\n\nThis morning I heard my parents talking about my problems getting up in the morning while putting my clothes on, saying things like \"I don't know what we should do with him\", \"Maybe we should cut his internet at night\", etc. and I just got irrationally angry about it. I felt really disrespected, like, why couldn't they talk to me directly, or at least make an effort to talk about it at a time where I couldn't hear them? I know this doesn't really qualify as talking behind my back - it's not like they were talking shit - but I had just gotten out of bed, and ended up getting quite angry.\n\nAnyway, I went into the kitchen and started making my breakfast, and said \"Maybe you could talk *to* me instead of *about* me?\" to my parents. Later, in the car, I explained to my mom why it had made me so mad, and while I was raising my voice quite a bit, I think she could see where I was coming from. We agreed to discuss the oversleeping thing after we get home.\n\nWhen I got home I sat down with my parents, and my dad and I got pretty mad at each other. I told him the same thing I've told you, that I felt disrespected, yada yada, and he called me disrespectful for living at their place and messing up their daily schedule. I can definitely see where he's coming from, but he wouldn't agree that what they did was disrespectful in the slightest and said that it wouldn't even have happened if I had just got out of bed on time, and that, again, made me furious.\n\nI have this problem where I get along fine with friends, but easily get mad and act like an asshole to my family members, and I know that I definitely overreacted. Also, I understand that me not getting out of bed screws with everyone's day, and I'm really trying to better myself.\n\nAny tips/subreddits for dealing with angry outbursts?\n\nEdit: after writing this I realize that I'm probably the asshole.",

    "selftext": "So, about a month ago, I asked out my best friend. Let's just say it didn't go too well and she dumped me on Wednesday. That day, I didn't feel great and I wanted to get everything out. In speech, we are doing this relationship elevator model thing where we detail a relationship that ascended, and then descended to put it bluntly. It started with pre-interaction awareness, went up to intimacy, and ended on seperation, and subsequent Post-interaction to sum up the model. Anyway, mine took me 6 hours and ended up being 11 pages long (not double spaced). I literally detailed our whole relationship from when we met, became best friends, started dating, and then broke up. I was pretty proud of this, and my friend Sarah, who was in Speech last semester and did this assignment but shared it with the friend group wanted to read it when I said that I was doing it in our group chat and that it was really helping. After that, everyone else in the group wanted to see it, so I just let them all read it too. I took out all of the personal details that might make her uncomfortable that other people know that she pretty much has only told me before I did though. Anyway, I let her read it too and I guess she was under the impression that she was the only one who read it because she got pissed when I told her I let all of my friends read it. I tried to talk to her today (Friday) to give her a drawing she drew that I still had and she told me not to talk to her, so I just gave her the drawing and she immediately threw it away. My friend told me the next period that she asked him if he had read it and he said that he did and she said that was weird that I was letting so many people read it (really only like 10 people at the VERY greatest including her). So, I was kind of pissed that she was talking shit behind my back. I texted her that period and our conversation went like this:\n\nMe: So I'm not allowed to talk to you anymore?\n\nHer: Why are you going sharing that document with everyone? Like are you fucking serious?\n\nMe: Yeah apparently I'm weird because I wanted to get out the feelings of a breakup I wasn't expecting. You said you didn't talk shit behind my back and why does it matter who I share that document with. It doesn't fucking matter. Just because you're a closed book and don't like to talk to anyone about ANYTHING doesn't mean I'm like you.\n\nHer: I'm a closed book to people I don't know which is normal. I'm open to my friends and people who I want to talk to and it matters who you share that document with because it's MY fucking business too, not just yours. Just because you got your feelings hurt doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want.\n\nMe: You assume that I shared it with people to get at you. You aren't that fucking important. I shared it because I thought it was a cool story. Sarah showed hers with the group so I told her I used her idea and everyone else wanted to see it too. That's all that happened.\n\nHer: I never said you did it to get at me. I know you did it because you just wanted to because you didn't fucking care to ask if I was okay with that and fuck what sarah does. That's her choice and whoever she fucking wrote about.\n\nMe: Whatever. It's my business too so I didn't think I had to ask you. I honestly shouldn't have let you read it. Plus, I didn't share the really personal stuff because I have respect for you. I didn't think any of what I wrote was even that personal at all. People know we dated. People know we went to each other's houses.\n\nNo reply for 20 minutes\n\nMe: Apparently I can't talk to you anymore and you throw away papers I give you for no fucking reason and then talk shit behind my back in the same period so I guess we won't be friends. That sucks but if you're gonna be like that I don't care.\n\nIt's around 6 hours later and she still hasn't replied. So, I want to know AITA for not asking her if I could share the details of our relationship with my friends (also, it was nothing sexual. We dated for a month and didn't even kiss).\n\nTL:DR; AITA for sharing the details (nothing sexual) of my relationship with my best friend turned girlfriend who just dumped me with my friends?",

Anyways I got to the theater like 20 minutes early so I got my snacks and just walked into the theater and I sat in the handicapped section but not in a handicapped seat, then I went to the restroom but i left my snacks there. Anyways I got back to the theater and I saw a guy and a manager talking and walking into the theater I was just minding my business but the guy was really talking to him saying stuff like \"why would they fucking do that\" and \"That person is just shitty\" he said a few more things but I didnt catch it. I heard the manager say \"dont worry ill talk to them when they get back\" then it dawned on me, that guy was complaining cuz I sat in the handicapped section. I spoke up and said \"oh you guys are talking about me\" the guy looks right at me and the manager says \"im sorry sir do you mind moving\" I said yes and apologized about sitting in the wrong section. I looked over and that guy had a dude in a wheelchair there. I moved seats and the manager approached me I told him I heard everything he said about me and he said \"Yes im sorry about that sir, ill be right back\" then he came back and gave me a free popcorn voucher. Now heres the thing yes I was sitting in the handicapped section but I WASNT on a handicapped seat, also I have a prosthetic leg and I walk with a noticeable limp. I watched the movie and went home, I told my mom and she said \"you should have just sat there\" I told a friend of mine over facebook and he said the same thing. I mean I guess I could have told that guy who was ranting that I heard every word he said and that he should calm down, BUT I knew that would only escalate things and I didnt want that. A part of me thinks I should have approached that man and said \"excuse me sir I have a fake leg and I can sit there if I want to\" or \"hey sir do you want to say all of that to my face??\" I didnt tho, but now i wish I would. Oh well its over now and I got a free popcorn slip out of it LOL. Am I the asshole?  ",

    "selftext": "That's a super dramatic title, but I couldn't think of a better way to word it. I'm a bit unsure at the moment whether I handled everything in a mature fashion, and I feel like I need some advice on what I could/should *actually* do now. I am aware that this isn't the perfect subreddit for this, but I don't want to spam it on previous subreddits that the topic has been buried in. So I guess for this one I want to ask whether I'm an asshole for handling this immaturely.\n\nFull story:\n\nI started a program and became friends with a girl. We hung out a lot. I asked her out and she started, at least from my POV, avoiding me. This made me extremely upset (I don't want to say depressed because I've never been clinically depressed) and I ended up quitting the program. We did talk the last few days (and admittedly talked a bit even after that, but she did mainly ignore me and it felt awkward), and I told her that I was quitting because I wasn't a fan of the program. \n\nThis is almost 6 months later, and a couple of months ago I removed her from Facebook after just hiding her updates, because they did make me upset just remembering her (well, I'm not sad, I just don't want to be reminded). I was upset for a solid two or three months after quitting, as well as a couple of weeks before doing so.\n\nNow, to me it's almost obvious that I shouldn't have said anything. She did nothing wrong by turning me down and ignoring me, despite the fact that we were friends, I'm sure she didn't even notice me just removing her, and she should not be subject to my depression that's completely mine to deal with.\n\nIt's definitely too late now to write a message. I feel like that would be creepy and out of nowhere and make her feel anxiety that she has no reason to feel. But I never told her that I got upset that she avoided me. I talked to my friends about it, never said anything to her. Should I have said something to her or did I do the right thing not telling her the truth?\n\nAt this point it's too late, but I just started thinking about her again.\n\nNot constantly and in the same way as before, just for a little while yesterday and perhaps a couple of times before.\n\n---\n\nI quite honestly don't know that this is a relevant subreddit, but I don't want to post it to the same subreddit twice in a row and I feel like I need advice on what to do (I realise I shouldn't talk to her).\n\nAm I the asshole for removing any traces of her? We were great friends and she didn't do anything wrong on paper... I feel like I could've handled the situation a bit better and possibly said something to her the day I quit the program.\n\nTL;DR: I met a girl and became friends with her in a program. We were close friends for over two months, when I asked her out. She started avoiding me and we didn't talk until the last few days once I'd decided I was too depressed to keep studying. I didn't tell her that I was hurt, I just said that I didn't enjoy the program. After a couple of months of depression afterwards and a few months after I felt better and completely restored, I removed her from Facebook. Did I handle this immaturely? If I was an asshole for doing this, despite the fact that I'm sure she didn't notice it, is it too late to do anything now or should I talk with her?",

I never use to choose sides, but this time I did and I chose to side with the parent in jail. Other parent decided that they did not like this, and that they'll try everything in their power to make me homeless (I'm male, at the time 16) so I ended up staying at this house, that house, and sometimes even on the street.\n\nBest friend (call him John) at this time was there for shits a giggles, and I appreciate that, but he wasn't there at all emotionally whatsoever, nor did I expect him to be. So you know, I didn't care, I strut my own game and did what I had to do with the parent bullshit, and he was there for a laugh.\n\nAfter parent comes out of jail, they decided to get back together again, and this time I had enough so I left the country to live with other family. I had to move away from everything, this was the place I grew up in and of course, because I was the one leaving the parents, the parent that tried making me homeless blamed everything squarely on me. (Funnily enough, they've broken up again).\n\nJohn told me he's gonna miss me and all that, but it all felt forced. Anyway, I didn't care. In the last 2 years I've been back to that country and met him. Shits and giggles like the usual.\n\nLast year, however, he started chatting shit about how I'm being dickhead to my mother and I need to straighten up. And he said it multiple times - so I'm shook at how a dude who I grew up with cannot empathise with the fact that I went to hell and back because of my mother, and that had me doubting myself for days. I told him how much it impacted me and told him to clear up what he meant just to give him the benefit of the doubt (nobody, apart from strangers, tell me to respect my parents). Having asked him, he didn't reply, *waited around for roughly a month*, so I took that as a notice to end our 10 year friendship and block him off social media and out of my life.\n\nFast forward to this week, he's been getting numerous friends of his to tell me to talk to him, giving me his number so I could give him an explanation as to why I've disappeared. I thought about it and did just that. I told him why, and I LET IT KNOWN that I wasn't pursuing a friendship or anything, nor did I have anything against him, and I also acknowledged that I should have let it be known why I blocked him when I initially blocked John. He replied with insults and shit like 'you're so childish, how could you do this to someone who has been there for you and someone you've grown up with?' Then John decided to lecture me again about how I'm treating my mother is wrong.\n\nI was gonna reply, but then he blocked me. What it feels like to me is that he's manipulated the whole situation to make it look like I wronged him when really he wronged me. But I'm even doubting that now.\n\nI unblocked him on social media out of curiousity about an hour ago, and I seen that he's been indirecting me saying shit like 'some people are so irrelevant' and that 'people are temporary'. He begged me to contact him, didn't like what I had to say cos it hurt his ego or whatever, and twisted the situation completely to make me seem in the wrong.\n\nSo now I feel hella insecure and I'm not even that certain whether I'm the one who was actually a dickhead. Please help?\n\nIf he was the one who was a dickhead, my life has been spent being fucked over by people who should be there for me the most. I feel an unbelievable rage atm and if you can give me an idea as to what I could do in order to solve this, then it'd be appreciated.\n\nedit: what I meant by that last remark is, how should I get back at him? I feel like that's the only thing that will settle how I'm feeling.\nedit: that I waited a while before I blocked him.",

Which -is- technically true, but I think he's ignoring some key points:\n\nA) I never ask him to do any housework - he does it because he prefers a tidier house than I do (he likes a clear sink, I'm happy to let the few dishes we use stay 'til the weekend, etc.). Plus, he never asks me to do any chores for him before just going ahead and doing them anyway (and usually rejecting my help when I offer it because I don't do things fast enough or thoroughly enough for him).\n\nAnd B), he doesn't work or contribute to the bills at all, whilst I work a stressful job all day and don't usually get back until late evening. He's not a student either, though he's planning to go back to education soon-ish. I don't want to say that obligates him to do more chores, and I wouldn't dream of forcing him to 'earn his keep', but it feels like he expects me to both work and do all the chores for him while he plays his game for 30 hrs straight. \n\nWith those points in mind, I don't feel like he's justified in getting mad at me. But he's still sitting in the other room ignoring me and making me feel like a shit girlfriend, so I don't know.

    "selftext": "A bit of context, I'm currently in highschool and my brother is in University. We're both PC enthusiasts but he also spends long hours studying. In the past, while staying with our dad, we both got some hand-me-down office chairs that were, to put it frankly, beat to shit and not very good. They were uncomfortable and very bad for both my brother's and my backs.\n\nAt our mom's, however, which we recently moved back to, I have a much better office chair which is adjustable in several ways, most notably, the actual seat of the chair can be tilted forward or backward. My brother is exceptionally tall and needs a range of adjustment, otherwise he gets back pain or his legs fall asleep. \n\nMy brother has asked me to switch chairs, and I did refuse, but assured him there was room for consideration. I just was not prone to do so at the time. \n\nRecently, while I was sleeping, my brother took my chair from the basement and replaced it with his, either not expecting me to notice or not expecting me to care. I did notice, and care. This made me quite livid, which I believe is fairly understandable, as he instead of asking me again decided to go behind my back. I understand my brother needs the chair, but now I feel less inclined to give it to him.\n\nMy brother has the means to get a chair of his own. Our mom would likely be very supportive of buying or giving him one more suited to his needs, and he is far from being broke himself. This has been my chair for a very long time and it frustrates me that he would rather just take mine than get another. This is also after he stole shelves from my room, which I decided to let go.\n\nMy brother however has started to make petty threats, like saying he'll take his room back (I'm currently in his old room, he moved to a different one) among others. I understand that this would help my brother; however the manner in which he's handled this has made me less inclined to give it to him. Pardon the wall of text, but Am I The Asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: Brother has back problems and wants my chair because it's better. I said no, but was open to consideration. Later, before asking me again, he stole it from me and replaced it with his. I switched them back and he's now miffed and making petty threats.**",

That was a mistake. \n\nShe kept coming to me with anecdotal evidence and I had to explain that it was bullshit evidence each time. I got really fed up one day and said it was bullshit and that by supporting it she is helping to create an anti-science culture and that all her homeopath friends are either charlatans or idiots and that by supporting it she was no better than they are. I was pretty riled up and I obviously hurt her feelings but I also think I proved my point. She hasn't offered me homeopathy in months. \n\nIt was something she truly believed in and I systematically dumped all over it.

She speaks English very well, because she's lived in the States for the past ten years. She's originally from Chile and speaks Spanish as her mother tongue. \n\nUp till now she's always tried her best not to speak in Spanish in front of me whenever I was around, which is unnatural for her since she exclusively speaks in Spanish with her son. She must've gotten mad at me for something again, because the last time I was at their place, she completely ignored me and spoke to her son only in Spanish. The same thing happened yesterday. \n\nHer behavior makes me feel like she's not acknowledging my presence and she's doing it out of spite, because she usually gets mad at me and I would have no idea. For example, she admitted to my boyfriend that she conscientiously ignored me on my birthday because I forgot to wish her a good flight one time. This happens relatively often, and I'm wondering if this is just one of her petty behaviors. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she just doesn't have the patience anymore to translate the stuff she has to say to her son, because she's getting old and going through menopause and has rheumatoid arthritis, which she tends to blame a lot of her behaviors on. Maybe I'm being too sensitive and I should just brush it off. \n\nMy boyfriend brought the issue up with her already and she denies doing it completely, so I don't know how to solve this small problem. \n\n\n",

I'll be copying and pasting the EXACT transcript (no paraphrasing) so you don't just have to take my word for it or let my biased words change the meaning of the text.\n\nMy mom said that she was going to do some yard work while I was out of town. I asked her if she was also going to give the dog a bath (because she REALLY needs one). \n\nIn response, my mom said \"no,\" because, as she said, she had agoraphobia, meaning she was scared to walk out the door, and the little bit she had done was too much.\n\nI texted back saying \"okay, but that's not what agoraphobia is.\"\n\nEDIT: I got a reply saying that I knew what she meant so I started a fight over nothing. I neglected to point out that I sincerely thought she had gotten the phobias confused (I can relate - I once insisted that xenophobia was the fear of change before someone pointed out to me that it was the fear of people from other countries. Sorry about the miscommunication)\n\nShe texted back:\n\n\"Bullshit! Agoraphobia is a panic disorder where you technically have a fear of having panic attacks. It can get so bad that you can't even leave the house. I am not telling you that this is what I diagnosed myself with. This is what my psychiatrist diagnosed me with. I start having a panic attack as soon as I place my hand on the door.\"\n\nI replied saying:\n\n\"That's not what you said the first time.\"\n\nShe said:\n\n\"Just because I worded it in a simpler way doesn't mean it's not the same thing. I tried to word it in a way that was easier to understand. I was describing my symptoms for thos specofic situation, not defining agoraphobia.\"\n\nThen I said:\n\n\"But I know what agoraphobia is, and even if I didn't, I could easily figure it out. Since you said something that was technically wrong, I called you out on it.\"\n\nShe replied saying:\n\n\"The way you went anout it was rude and insulting, [name]. You showed absolutely zero sympathy for how hard this morning was for me. You didn't even acknowledge that I had a hard time.\"\n\nAt that point, I decided to stop talking and let us each cool off. I didn't want to escalate the situation any further. An hour later, she said:\n\n\"So apparently,  I'm not getting an apology. So fine, have a nice time with [name] and [name]. I'll talk to you when you get back home.\"\n\nI said:\n\n\"Now I'm in trouble for trying to give us time to cool off and not escalate the situation? That's what I was trying to do. I'm sorry if I came off as being \"rude and insulting,\" but all I said was \"okay, but that's not what agoraphobia is.\" I would have acknowledged that you had a bad time if you had just said that you were merely describing YOUR symptoms and not blown it into a huge argument.\"\n\nThere's a good bit of profanity in her reply, so I'm not going to include it, but she basically implied that I'm grounded when I get home.\n\nI don't think I'm the A-hole, and neither does my brother, but I want to know YOUR opinion. Sorry for the long post, but I didn't want any part of the conversation to be lost.",

    "selftext": "I've been chatting with someone from okcupid for a couple months now, we know each other pretty well, and have exchanged numbers and also talked on the phone quite a few times.\n\nIt started turning somewhat romantical, and I've basically started to accept polyamory as a concept for my own life because of her. She never wanted a relationship, and I stopped wanting it as well. Still, there was something.\n\nWe talked about pretty intimate stuff. Essentially we both knew pretty much knew at least the gist of each other's sex and romatical lives.\n\nI know she has a troubled past. She had an abusive partner in the past and has nightmares because of it. She is somewhat stuck at home having to care for her mother with alzheimers (or something akin to it, I don't remember what exactly it was), whose behavior is sometimes very erratic.\n\nWe've arranged dates multiple times and she always cancelled. Sometimes because of work, sometimes she told me outright that she didn't feel comfortable with meeting because she needs a lot of alone time - and because she lives pretty far away, a date would include me staying with her for the night.\n\nThis friday, to my surprise, she told me that I could come visit because she cancelled her plans for Saturday. That night, i.e. the one between Friday and Saturday, she cancelled again - because she was scared she'd disappoint me, and that she might not be in a good mood, and might need alone time.\n\nAt that point I was a little done, because I'd gotten excited to meet her so many times and it never worked out, and it was just too frustrating to continue like that. I wanted to end this relationship with her because I cannot deal with never meeting a person I'm as interested in as in her and essentially just text chatting forever. I was a little frustrated and said some things I wasn't that proud of, at which point she wrote \"That's enough.\" and turned off her phone.\n\nThe next morning, I sent her a message, wanting to say goodbye and part on better terms. As I said, I wasn't proud of the things I said that night, so I wanted to at least say some nicer words for a goodbye.\n\nAfter I sent my last message, she told me I could come over now. I wasn't excited. But I thought, I'm not the kind of person to just say \"no\" now on principle, so I agreed if she'd send me the address. And she did. And she seemed excited. She told me we probably wouldn't have sex because she's on her period, and she also told me we'd have to go shopping later because she doesn't have any vegan food for dinner (I'm vegan, she's vegetarian).\n\nSo I got up, got ready, did my makeup and stuff and drove over to her, two and half hours. I arrived, we hugged, and I was really happy to finally see her. We went to her room and sat on the bed as she finished up her laundry. We chatted. I looked at her a lot, I was really excited and content to finally see her and be with her. But me looking at her irritated her. She kept asking me what's wrong.\n\nWe continued chatting for a bit. I asked her if I could lean onto her. She said no. But I was so confused by this no, and it sounded a little like it could be sarcasm. Also, she said earlier that we wouldn't be having sex because she's on her period. This indicated to me that she'd be willing to otherwise, and I thought, because of that, and because of how intimate our chatting was, touching and cuddling would be okay. I asked her if it was sarcasm, she said no. I did not touch her.\n\nThen, she got up, storing something away in her closet, and this conversation happened:\n\n&gt; Her: Are you staring at me?\n\n&gt; Me: Yes.\n\n&gt; Her: Why?\n\n&gt; Me: Because you're pretty?\n\n&gt; Her: That's a shitty answer.\n\n&gt; Me: What else am I supposed to say?\n\n&gt; Her: How about \"sorry?\"\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, sorry, I'll stop looking at you then.\n\nShe sat down next to me again.\n\nWe talked a bit more, about everyday stuff. A little later:\n\n&gt; Me: I'd like to touch you.\n\n&gt; Her: -silence-\n\n&gt; Me: But you don't want that.\n\n&gt; Her: No.\n\nI thought about what to say for a moment.\n\n&gt; Me: That's completely fine.\n\nMore silence.\n\n&gt; Her: Do you know now why I thought this was a bad idea?\n\nI didn't know what to say. I just kind of said something like that I'm still happy to be here and that it always takes a little while to get comfortable with someone new in person and stuff.\n\nShe then asked me if I'd mind driving back home. She said she'd really like to be alone right now.\n\nI did not expect this. At all. I started thinking about what I could say to change something, and how I'd driven to her 2.5 hours, and how this would be pretty much over forever now. Upon her asking her how she imagined that this would go she said she'd only asked me over because I wanted to break off contact otherwise. And that it was a bad idea. She gave me a 50\u20ac bill for gas and very reluctantly, I left.\n\nI asked to hug her goodbye. She declined. I left the house, and started crying. I called a friend and told her about what happend, as I walked around the town she lives, my car parked about 20 meters from her driveway. After about 20 minutes or so, I arrive back at my car, and I'm still talking to my friend on the phone. I sit down in the trunk of my car and cry more as I'm talking to my friend. She comes outside, and asks me to leave because I'm making her nervous. I was completely destroyed at this point. I just mumbled something like \"Okay, I'm leaving.\"\n\nAnd then I drove around a few corners, cried some more while talking to a friend and slowly started heading home.\n\nNow, this morning she sent me a message about how it's not okay to try and discuss things after she told me to leave because I disrespected her boundaries. And she said it's not okay for me to wait outside her house for an hour after being told to leave.\n\nI responded saying how sorry I was. And I did explain I wasn't waiting for her or anything, I just had to process what happened. And I said sorry for not taking her worries about meeting seriously, and thinking it would turn out okay. And that was it. She blocked me.\n\nAnd now I feel terrible for having caused this reaction in her. And for it being over in no good way at all.",

Case in point, yesterday she gets back from work, seems in a perfectly good mood, we're lying in bed looking at something on the iPad and I have my hand on her boob. In this instance, although I previously stated we both engage in \"light torture\" that actually wasn't on my mind, however for what she admitted was half a second and what I think was perhaps 1 full second I ran my finger up and down her nipple to which I was greeted with (and you should read this in a very serious voice akin to someone genuinely accusing someone else of assault, this was not delivered \"light hardheadedly\" or as mere annoyance.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE, I DO NOT WANT TO BE NEAR YOU\" she pulls away and rolls over \"NO YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE\"\n\nI say woah, OK take it down a notch, was it really as bad as you are reacting?\n\n\"NO YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING ASSHOLE, LEAVE ME ALONE\" (or something to that effect)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, after a few minutes of receiving this I'm thinking \"OK well I know deep down I am aware she doesn't always love this, but sometimes she does and it's just good clean fun and sometimes this is how we interact with each other and also sometimes she does it to me. This to me feels like a reaction that would be more appropriate had I pinned her down or something and refused to stop, but I didn't? It was a single time, done quite innocently because hey, what boyfriend doesn't like his girlfriends nipples.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile I am still receiving some abuse and it is getting to me, she then starts saying to me \"PROMISE YOU WILL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN\" to which my reaction was \"well, no, I can promise to try my best to never cause you deliberate harm but then again, I was not trying to cause you deliberate harm this time either, furthermore you are treating me like I seriously abused you when in reality, though I accept you clearly did not like what I did, it was not abuse, it was part of the normal horseplay both of us involve ourselves in only this time you seem to be really really over reacting.\" I also feel that her reaction, ironically, is an abuse in itself. It feels like I punched someone but then get convicted for murder.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings cool down a little and she then apologises and said she knows she overreacted....this is then followed by her saying \"how horrible it was that I did that\" that I \"cant understand\" and that it was \"so so so horrible that I did that\" (she likes to repeat for effect) and that I need to \"PROMISE TO NEVER DO THAT AGAIN, YOU KNOW I HATE IT\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo which my reply again is, yeah OK but we have been through this, I didn't do anything to deliberately cause harm, though I can see it is easy to confuse the two, this was not an occasion where I had horseplay on my mind and even if it was this still remains something we both engage in equally without this end reaction. So what makes this occasion so special? \"should I just never touch your nipples again?\" I say - to which she says that is \"ridiculous and besides the point\".... but is it? If even by accident I can cause such apparent pain and discomfort how else can I \"promise\" to never do this again?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis argument went around and around in circles and as of 9:30am (starting at 6pm last night) is still ongoing (though she is at work now.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Her Side**\n\nShe feels that I don't acknowledge how she feels, that I do not understand her side and that I am lacking empathy. She feels that I do not accept how bad it made her feel and that I am not conciliatory and that I am not apologising properly nor am I promising to not do it again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**My Side**\n\n I do accept and I have apologised to her in a way that I think is suitable given the transgression. I said something like: \"clearly you did not enjoy this one nipple touch, and I am sorry it caused you discomfort\". The problem I have taking this apology one step further is that she makes me feel so strongly that the punishment here is not fitting the crime. I accept I did something she didn't like, but why am I being made to feel like I attempted a knowing, genuine and malicious assault? Every fibre of my being feels like this whole situation is so wrong, that I am being mistreated and that I cannot swallow her accusations or give her the apology she wants because they are not fair accusations. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know that I don't fully understand her because I am the sort of person that even if I experience something unpleasant will reserve the \"losing of my shit\" for when it really crosses the line. The problem I have with my dear girlfriend, is that her \"line\" appears to me as if it changes with the wind.\nFinally, I accept that I find it very hard (inwardly) to not think she is acting \"crazy\" or to belittle her feelings because to me, even the fact we are arguing this bad because I touched her nipple drives me crazy. Yes you didn't like it, but it was one touch of your nipple ffs. (I don't convey this quite so bluntly, but I'm sure it slips out)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAm I the asshole and should I just be apologising instead of arguing so hard?",

Both my husband and his mother (she lives with us) INSISTED she have a bath seeing as it is \"more fun\". My husband agreed he would do it, I said that was fine by me, I had to feed our younger one. \n\nA little while later he calls me upstairs because she splashed water all over him when he tried to wash her hair. I go up, interrupting our son's feeding, wash her hair and body (with much fighting and crying) then call him back up so I can continue to feed the little one and he can finish giving her a bath and let her play in the tub. I called him up in a sing-songy voice but he somehow heard an urgency in my voice and ran up. Apparently he just got the baby to sleep and he woke up when hubby yelled back up to me. I did not know that he was asleep. He got mad at me for wanting to switch back out when he couldn't do something he said he could do, that I knew wouldn't be easy so I wanted to do something different in the first place, but I got vetoed. Am I the asshole for switching back out so that he could finish the task he started, (that he said would be \"so much more fun\" if he did it instead of me) and so that I could go back and finish feeding our infant. \n\nForgot to mention, I was kind of already in a bad mood as I had a bit of an argument about her pyjamas with his mother when he took her in the bathroom.

    "selftext": "Alright I'll do my best to give as much context as possible.\n\nMy best friend/roommate and I have pets. We have 3 ferrets, and one of them is both of ours, while the other two are solely his. One of his, Trooper, had to have emergency surgery back in November for bladder stones and it was a hefty fee ($1500). He was not in the position to pay for all of it, so I covered half of it and also took care of all of the vet trips back and forth, and did all the medications and care afterwards. I told him I would help him the once but I cannot pay again.\n\nFast forward to this month. He had to have another emergency bladder surgery. Another 1600. He has the money as he's saving for a down deposit on a house this summer but expected me to cover half again. I told him that I would not pay for it again, Just like I wouldn't expect him to pay for my animals vet bills. They're his responsibility. However, I told him I would pay it up front and he could pay me back in chunks if that was easier for him.\n\nSo I paid the bill, did all the after care again and rearranged my schedule for the vet trips. He then decided that he is going to wait another year for his house so he can save more. Cool. So he has the money (more than enough) but has yet to pay me back anything other than 100 bucks.\n\nThis morning he informs me that he bought a second vehicle  (a used truck) for $1700. Now I'm angry. I used part of my savings to pay Troopers vet bill and I don't need that money right now as I don't have any emergency situations but I'm still angry that he has the money to pay me back but just hasnt. And then goes and buys a vehicle for more than he owes me.

    "selftext": "This is a long and sordid tale that has left me questioning myself and as I've nobody else to talk to about it I figure why not lean on that old cliche and rely on the kindness of strangers?\n\n(Names and minor details have been altered. And this is a long one.)\n\nI met this couple (Male and female, while I am male myself.) online. Let's call them Greg and Laura. I didn't pursue either of them, but I was a big fish in their small pond and got myself noticed. Over time, we became friends and got along great, I thought. Because of schedules, I spent a lot more time chatting with Laura than I did with Greg. Say, about every day with her, with him mostly on the weekends. Greg and I had a lot in common with interests and opinions, and, as I said, I was somewhat of an authority figure and he would come to me to discuss things. \n\nSo, I'd made a couple of new friends. Which was great for me as I don't do that often. I've been under the spell of severe depression for a long, long time and most of my real life friends had long since moved on. I went online to be a different, more outgoing person and that generally keeps people at a comfortable arm's length. However, Laura especially slipped under my guard. It wasn't too long before our chats became more general and not about what we'd originally met doing.\n\nGreg and Laura lived together. I knew that much. They'd been a couple for a while and I was happy for them. As far as I knew, that was the extent of things. I should add that they lived across the continent from me--there was never anything more on the table from the beginning, as far as I was concerned. I might visit one day, but that was always a what if.\n\nThey told me they were moving, this time even further away. For Greg's work. I was happy for them still. For me, it meant altering my schedule a bit to accommodate the new difference in time zones, but I'm naturally a bit of an insomniac and staying up a bit later didn't bother me. Then things started to change.\n\nBoth Laura and Greg, at different times, with different words, and for different reasons, told me they were having some problems. Mostly Laura, who had left all her old friends behind in the move and wasn't making new ones. She'd found a low-level retail job, but Greg complained that she did nothing but go to work, come home, and park herself on her computer. He told me he was worried she wouldn't ever socialize, leading to sinking into depression. He said she was spending what little money she made ordering frivolous trinkets online. It's around this time that Laura told me I was her best friend.\n\nI did my best to take a neutral position. I completely understood what Greg was saying, and I did what little I could to encourage Laura to be more outgoing. Mostly, she wanted to complain about the customers at her job. I was also very careful to keep strict confidence with both of them, considering my position. There was never a, \"Greg said X about you,\" or, \"Laura said Y.\" Greg told me that he wanted to help her because he cared about her a lot, and I believed him. \n\nAt one point, something happened and Laura snapped. She retreated into herself completely, stopped talking to me, removed me from her contacts. This lasted about a month until she came back and apologized. I knew she was taking medication for depression as well. Things happen. After that, things went back to normal, I thought. We continued to chat, possibly even more than before, started to add in semi-regular Skype calls as well. For me, as a total introvert, I knew I was putting a lot into our friendship and I tried to be careful about that. Half of that was selfish--I didn't want to scare her away. Just having someone to talk to made every day so much more bearable than it had been, and that she didn't know me, really, before then--that she came at me without bias, without all the disappointments that I thought had driven the other people in my life away . . . well, it was a singular thing that I hadn't even known I needed until I had it.\n\nSomething else happened, this time more direct. The three of us were doing something together and it all seemed normal until it ended. The next day, I couldn't contact Greg. I asked Laura about it, she kind of shrugged. Then she tells me that she'll probably have to stop talking to me for a while and disappears, too. I get the impression this is relationship stuff and I tell her to take as much time as she needs to work it out, that I know Greg cares about her as he's told me more than once, that I'm rooting for them. \n\nGreg has a distinct personality online. Not quite mean spirited, but definitely offensive. And I didn't mind that at all, because I could be the same. When we talked, it often went outside the bounds of good taste. This will be relevant soon.\n\nA good long while goes by without any contact from either of them. Greg completely removed me from his contacts, Laura is absent. Then, out of nowhere, I get an email from Laura. Nothing related to what we'd been doing before. She says she'd recently watched a documentary about something she knows I'm familiar with and wanted to ask a few questions. I answered. She asked more questions. I answered again. Things go on like this until we have hundreds-long email chains. During this, she tries to explain what happened, from her perspective. \n\nAs she describes it, Greg is very controlling in their relationship, and apparently has a jealous streak, too. He was the one who told her to stop chatting with me. To stop chatting with everyone, it seemed. She said she had one female friend she could still talk to, and she was busy going through her own relationship issues. Something happened during our last interaction that Greg took as flirting (from me), and that was the final straw for him. Like I said, Greg was no stranger to a crude comment, and though I couldn't give you an exact play-by-play of what happened, particularly because I wasn't paying attention at the time the same way he was, I am still to this day that whatever I said was a response to some comment he made. Not that it matters, really.\n\nLaura and I begin chatting on Skype again. Now she's telling me her problems the same way I had told her mine, and she's being very open. intimate stuff, too. Not quite sex, but sex-adjacent, you know? Like how he'd come home and see that the drawer where they kept their toys was slightly ajar, which caused him to accuse her of cheating behind his back via cybersex. That he doesn't look at her or touch her anymore, barely speaks to her. That sort of thing. No physical abuse, ever, but it's pretty clear who has the power as he's the one paying for everything and she's across the country from her family and any other real support.\n\nHere I am glad to have my friend back, but unable to figure out what to do beyond that. I don't know what to tell her, how to advise her, and I still tell her that, though I believe everything she tells me, I can't jump on a hate train against Greg without his side of things. Even then, I still thought of him as some sort of friend, too. I tried getting back in contact a few times, sending emails, small gestures of goodwill. He never responds.\n\nEventually, Laura and I move from emails to Skype chats. Mostly text, since she can use her phone for that. She's keeping her talks with me a secret from Greg. Then things went in a direction I never would have predicted: before the new year, Laura tells me that she loves me. Not only that, but that she'd had a crush on me almost from the first time we'd interacted. \n\nI start to put a few pieces together. Since getting back in contact with me, actually since just before she broke off communications the last time, she'd started to ask me questions about my personal life, my past, relationships, whether I was looking for a girlfriend, had I ever been in love. At the time, I thought that she was doing that to vet me for the exact things that Greg seemed to be wary of, trying to figure out if I was after something more than being her best friend. At every juncture, I thought, I'd assured her that wasn't the case. Besides one person for less than a month, she didn't know of any girls I'd been involved with for all the time we'd known each other, and I'd explained that where I was in my life at that time I didn't think looking was a real option. \n\nLaura told me she was going home to visit her mother for the holidays and that's what she feared the most. She expected Greg to start bombarding her with calls and messages about all their problems as soon as she was away from him. She wanted to end it--figured it was over anyway, but didn't know what else to do from there. I didn't know if any of this was because of me and didn't know how, or want to, ask. Had I lead her on by not immediately shooting down her friendship? That didn't seem right. I will say that I was 100% oblivious to all of it, though Laura claimed she'd flirted with me in some capacity more than once.\n\nThings seem to cool off a bit. We're talking, it's helping me deal with my own problems. Laura is a caring person who I'd already known was interested in me and wanted to help. I relied on that and tried to reciprocate. When Laura goes home, she asks me to write her a letter, which I do. I write out a dozen pages by hand (it's not really a love letter, I wouldn't know how to do that) and send it to her along with hand-made knitted cap. It's over between her and Greg, but she has to keep things quiet until she can figure out what to do. Probably move back home or figure something out at work. If she can get a promotion she might be able to afford her own place. Until then, she has to go back and she and Greg have basically become roommates. Until he finds the letter. He snoops through her stuff sometimes. They have a fight over that. Greg knows enough about me to know that I'm the one who wrote it, so I guess his paranoia is vindicated.\n\nI wish this story had a happy ending for all involved. Or any ending at all. It doesn't, not yet. Laura is still living in Greg's apartment, still indecisive about a promotion she's pretty sure management is only teasing her with. She might save up for another ticket home. I really don't know, because two weeks ago Laura missed our scheduled call and has been ghosting me since. I managed to contact her mother and find out that she's safe but not much more than that. Sometimes she shuts herself away. I'm trying to be patient. When she disappeared again, like that, it hurt in a way that I'd never felt before, and came at a particularly bad time for me. When she asked me if I'd ever been in love before, I said that I hadn't, but I don't think I can ever say that again. Sometimes I still feel like I should contact Greg again, try to explain myself, but it seems pointless and almost vindictive now.\n\nAnyway, this entire thing is outside my wheelhouse.

    "selftext": "Yesterday I spent the day at my girlfriend's house, but at night we were going to different parties. I would go to the house of a friend who was celebrating her birthday, and my girlfriend did not want to go with me because a friend of hers had invited her to a nightclub. So far so good, because everything was okay between us about the fact that each one would go to a different place. Before going to the party, my girlfriend bought 2 LSDs for her and her friend to use that night.\n\n\nAfter a while my girlfriend started sending me messages via Whatsapp asking for help, however I figured she was drugged (after a while she confirmed that she had taken it). I answered her messages trying to keep her calm, thinking she was on a bad trip, and that everything was fine since her friends were together. Then she called me saying \"there are only men here, help me, help.\"\n\n\n\n(In her whole life she has been betrayed by men. As a child, when she felt abandoned by her father, when her parents divorced, and her father assaulted her mother, and also when her father compared her body to the body of her classmates. As a teenager (12 by the time) and she dated a boy older than her (15), and he convinced her to have sex. Even as an adult, when she was drunk and raped by a guy she met on the first date. And that created a repulsion in her by the idea of \u200b\u200bthe masculine. In fact, I'm her only heterosexual man friend, she can not deal with men. Her only male friends are gay.)\n\n\n\nAfter the messages, she stopped asking for help for a bit. But she called me back after several minutes. She was desperate, said she was lost, that there were only men at the party, that they were all rapists and that she did not find her friends. So she decided to leave the party alone and walk down the street. We live in a country where it is very dangerous to walk alone on the street even more at night and in the center of the city, she was in a panic and called me. I was at the party at my friend's house and I tried to calm her down because I thought she was on a bad trip, after some time she seemed calmer and more sensible, decided to take a taxi to go home while I was listening to her on the way. She talked to the taxi driver calmly and got into the car and then hung up the phone.\n\n\n\nThen, she sent me a message that she had come home, and that she was laughing and watching adventure time (she loves it), so I imagined she was safe and calm. I asked if I could go to my place, and she says \"okay\" and and so I went. when I arrived, she called me saying that I should have gone to get her where she was.\nThe problem was that I was far from where she was, and she was in a dangerous place. I thought that if I came for her, she'd be in more danger by waiting for me alone on the street than if she took a cab and went home.\nI'm very much in doubt if I really should have gone to meet her, while her friends were with her, I was far away and it would be a long time coming, she did not know exactly where I was and I had no way of contacting her if I had gone\n\n---\ntl;dr: GF asked for help while she was on LSD.

    "selftext": "There is a girl I've known for a few years (before even meeting my friend) from university. We'd flirted here and there but nothing came of it, and we were full platonic when I had a long term girlfriend. My friend, her, and me spent a fair bit of time together in our final year of university, where he developed a crush for her. About a year or so later, he finally admits to her his feelings but she doesn't reciprocate at all, and is clear about that. A couple months later we invite her to stay for the weekend and after a night of drinking the now single me, and her get with each other (just making out). \n\nI believe the part where I may be an asshole is that I don't think my friend knows, and so I should have at least told him out of respect. He's a pretty sensitive guy, and so I thought I shouldn't tell him to spare him, but i've been told otherwise. I'm also not sure how this works with the bro code, but I'd like to hear your opinions.",

    "selftext": "So, this is cutting an extremely long story short. I have a very close friend that I'm very emotionaly attached to. I do have a thing for this person, but they don't feel the same, which is fine, we're still close friends. Until recently. The past week they've completly distanced themselves from me. I know that they have a lot of troubles in their life recently, much like myself, and I always check in on them to make sure they were okay, and if they weren't then I'd talk to them about it. And I could always tell them when something was bothering me or I had a bad day, just shit like that. Recently though, they've been straight up ignoring. They read my messages and not reply for like 8 hours. I'd understand if that happened once or twice, but this has been going on for about a month. But I still always try to ask them how they are and make sure they're okay. I usually don't get a response. I mentioned this to them, that it kind of upset me being ignored and they went on a huge tirade about how I don't understand and that I never do anything for them. A day or so after this, they apologised and thing went back to the 8 hour, no reply ignoring. Yesterday I sent them a message simply saying that I give up. And have gone on to explain that I think that I deserve to be treated better. Anyway, am I the asshole for doing this?",

    "selftext": "Edit: Thank you guys for being honest. Guess I am the asshole, but special thanks to u/abcdefg52 for giving me an insight into what must have been going on in my friend's head and see the situation through her eyes. It's hard learning that I was the asshole, but it's humbling and necessary so it was worth it. At least, my friend won't have to deal with me anymore, so there's that.\n\nEdit 2: You guys helped me see how it was manipulative of me, despite my intentions, to lie about my dad's offer. I know I was wrong to have gone on a rant about her being a bad friend. Those things, I agree, make me the asshole, but I disagree with me being the asshole for being a flawed human trying to help a friend who needed it despite inconveniences to me. I'm trying really hard for the lesson here not to be never to help again. I'm not an asshole for not helping her perfectly. If being an asshole is not wanting to be saddled with all the cleaning, communicating with her instead of secretly resenting her and expecting her to do the same, then I would gladly be the asshole again. Some comments here helped me see things from her point of view, but it's sad that I had to resort to internet strangers to guess how, what and why she felt. Thank you for helping me resolve part of this in my head.\n\n\nI wasn't sure whether to post this here or in r/relationships but my aim to get an outsider's perception on what I must have done wrong so here it goes.\n\nGrace and I have been friends since she was 12 and I was 17. She's 19 now and I'm 24. Last year, she had problems with her parents and had to move in with me twice. Honestly, It's ruined the friendship for me.\n\nThree weeks after she moved in first time, she moved out in anger because she hated and disagreed with my rules about keeping the house clean. She moved back home and we continued as friends. Two months later, she had problems again, asked to move back with me swearing she would follow the rules about cleaning and how I would not regret it etc. I didn't really want to because of what happened the last time but I wanted to help so I agreed. This time she was paying her half of the bills and things were better because I learned to overlook stuff. Whenever something (mostly about sharing the cleaning burden more evenly) bothered me, I'd talk to her about it and asked her to do the same for me. I got the feeling that she wasn't comfortable, didn't feel like it was her place too and my efforts and talks to remedy that changed nothing so I exaggerated the defects of the apartment and told her I didn't like it anymore and we started looking for a new place. I told her that, since I planned to leave the country anyway, she should choose the place and I'd move there with her so we could help each other save money.\n\nMy dad offered me a small apartment to live in rentfree but I refused because  I don't like the neighbourhood, I wanted to continue independent from my dad as he can be controlling and also because of my friend and our plans. I didn't tell my dad about the first two reasons, only about wanting to help my friend. I told my friend about my dad's offer but only my first two reasons for refusing it and reassured her I preferred finding somewhere else to live with her and sharing the bills.\n\nTwo weeks later she sends me a message saying she's moving the same day as she finally accepted her uncle's offer of an apartment. She said she didn't feel welcome at our apartment and felt judged etc., so she thinks it's better to go away. I told her that it was fine, I would return her half of the bills but I wanted to know if this was the first time her uncle had offered her the place and if yes, why she didn't tell me about his offer so I could be prepared whether financially or giving more thought to my dad's offer. I still don't understand what happened because sometimes she'd say it was a surprise but later she'd say her uncle had been pressuring her for a while and she told him to wait or she wanted to wait. \n\nI was mad and felt betrayed. I sent her messages and voice recordings telling her she was a bad friend, exaggerating her part in rejecting my dad's offer and how cold it was of her to listen to me talk for days about my dad's offer and all the while she had the offer from her uncle didn't breathe a word. She came home that day to pick her stuff up and shouted at me the entire time. Said lots of stuff about how she hated the cleaning rules, I was a goody two shoes who liked to judge her, nothing she did was ever good enough for me and she *HAD* told me about her uncle's offer. I didn't shout back, just reiterated that I wasn't mad about her leaving, I was mad about hiding her uncle's offer, not talking to me about stuff that bothered her despite me doing that and I would always be there if she needed me which only seemed to make her madder. We both cried a lot and she left very angry.\n\n I was sad, tearful and reflective for a while and thought about how it wasn't the first  time I'd felt that way because of her. I don't know if my feelings or how hard it hit me is an over-reaction but that's how I felt (still feel when i think about it now) and I sent her a message a week later saying I no longer wanted to be friends. We talked and she reminded me that she had casually talked about not wanting to go live in one of her uncle's apartments when she first moved in with me but I had forgotten. We kind of patched things up afterwards, apologised to each other but we've only spoken twice since with me initiating the conversation both times. She sent a message saying \"hi\", but I was cold in my reply.\n\nI watched 13 Reasons Why yesterday and I sent her a message telling her to watch it and that I was available if she ever needed to talk. This seems to have made her angry and has led to another argument about how I'm ignoring her, I accused her of stuff and lied. I reached out to her because even though I don't think I can be friends with her anymore I still care about her so I'm torn.\n\nI don't know if I'm angry or hurt or disappointed or sad at the things she said (especially because she didn't sit me down talk to me about  stuff, except to blow up when she left and say hurtful things) or the way she left.  I'm not here to ask if she's the asshole. I'm just a little obsessed with the idea that I might have been the asshole. I feel bad for not wanting to be her friend anymore and for feeling the way I do about everything. I'm biased about this and so all my friends who have been quick to demonise her so I'm asking internet strangers: Am I the Asshole? What non-asshole thing can I do now?",

Naturally, there's many scenarios of \"oh shoot, I forgot my wallet\", or \"one of us has to pay in cash\" etc. between any of us. The difference is that ANY time there's some form of money loan between me and another person (whether it's I owe them or they owe me), I always record it on a note. \nSo I have this list of instances where friends owe me money. I'm fairly good at paying others back, but my friends are not so good at paying me back. Because of this trend, I have a history of trying to remind them about when they owe me (because of the list, I obviously don't forget about it), but it's gotten to a point where they become legitimately upset about me even bringing it up, saying things like \"stop always nagging us about money\", \"you're super annoying when you keep bringing that up\", \"the more you bring it up, the less inclined I am to pay you back\", etc.\nI grew up in a lower class household, so I've always been semi conservative about money. I'm not afraid of loaning, but according to my friends, I'm being too uptight about it (despite having numerous accounts of friends having debts to me still). It should also be noted that these are all small transactions (paying for someone's dinner, splitting an Uber, etc.)\nAnyways, am I the asshole for the way that I'm trying to keep my funds balanced?

She carries a pair of kitchen gloves with her all around the world so she doesnt have to get her hands dirty. She also hates carrying anything that isn't essential to her travel (she threw my xmas gifts to her away we got when travelling together because she didn't want to travel with them).\n\nSo we decide to get each other funny /jokey presents for our 1 year anniversary and have a nice dinner out instead of spending loads of cash on presents. \n\nShe was going to get me a powerbank (a replacement present for an xmas gift she got me which broke), so i was thinking what can i get her that she will travel with (bearing in mind her flat out refusal to take anything non essential on her travels).\n\nI find a jokey pair of kitchen gloves on amazon. They are clearly a joke present, they have a fake diamond ring, fake pearls, feathers, and are bright pink. Very over the top.\n\nNow i'm not completely socially retarded, and i know this might be a little bit of a risky gift. So i start asking her vague questions seeing how she would react. After an hour or so she figures out what i was considering buying her and all hell breaks loose.\n\nShouting, screaming, cursing (all over whatsapp) etc etc for 3 hours. I tried to calm it down, apologised for a bad idea and asked her to apologise for (what i saw) as an overreaction to a gift idea. Predictably she refused and started bringing up other unrelated relationship stuff as often is the case with arguments.\n\nSo i really want to know, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to honestly think of information i have left out that might influence opinions, related backstory:\n\n- We have been seperated on / off for 2 months breaking up and getting back together.

    "selftext": "So... my 5 year old son does soccer, every Week at a large sports complex that I pay for. The class can have about 5-10 kids each week depending on how many show up. This week was a smaller 5 person class, which I love and my son does better in. Typically parents sit on the benches and watch, take pictures, or just play on their phone. A few of us like to sit right on the sidelines and encourage our kids and assist the coach with reminding our kids to spread out and generally cheer the fuck out of them. \n\nThis one kid, whose mother was a phone gamer this week, was totally disruptive. He didn't listen to any instructions from the coach this week. He, like his mother was off in his own world jumping on the inflatable dividers (which is forbidden), pulling in the coach's arm for attention, and jumping on top of the other kids while they were trying to listen to the coach's instructions. Typically, I let this kind of shit go because the kid is 5. I understand what it's like to have off days. But the kid was really disruptive. Towards the end of practice the Fuckhead, sorry, 5 year old walks up to my son and blatantly, without warning kicks him in the shin. They don't wear shin guards yet, so you can imagine the reaction from my son, who runs over to me in tears. At this point, I'm fuming, and I decide to talk to the mother. My other parents/friends suggested I let it go, presumably because of my mood but I persist. \n\nAfter practice as the absentee mother collects her Asshole Son, I calmly walk over and say \"Hi, Hello. So... I don't know if you noticed but your son was completely disruptive in class today.\" She of course had a shocked look on her face because she hadn't looked up all practice from her phone. I continue, \"He wasn't really paying attention, kept jumping on top of the other kids and at the end he kicked my son on the shin for no reason.\" She says \"Sorry.\" Just like that. Not \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, is your son ok?\" Just \"Sorry.\" So I conclude \"It's Ok. Maybe next week you could just pay attention and coral him. Thanks.\" So... Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all who responded. It seems the general consensus is that I'm not the asshole, but I should've let the Coach handle it. Something I should have added is that the Coach is a 15 year old kid who probably would never say something to a parent. That being said, in the future I will focus on what happened regarding my son only. Thanks a bunch. \n\n",

She rarely replies (she's said it's because of work and because she's rarely on facebook, I do trust her. Especially since a mutual friend pointed out the same thing when we were in school. I also don't know what her schedule looks like as she's working on a hotel, which might make the schedule a bit different from any other occupations). The responses most likely accurately told me that she isn't interested. I accept that, but I at least want her to give me a direct yes or no, or at least a response (she's close to 30, so it's not a maturity thing).\n\nShe usually responds after a long time. The last time she responded quickly was when she was at home and I apologized to her for sending a lot of messages.\n\nI don't mind that she takes a long time to reply. I accept that she's got work and I realise she can't make small talk. I haven't sent her a message yet, but I wonder if I would be an asshole to do so. It's the weekend now, so she could be off work for the week. She's already opened the message, so she wouldn't necessarily see in the messages that she hasn't responded. This is nothing new again, she's very slow when it comes to responding.\n\nBut I feel like this message is different. Now, it hasn't been as long as she usually takes, but right now it's the weekend. I don't think I'm asking too much when wanting her to give me a response right now.\n\nWould I be an asshole for asking her what her answer is? I am obviously a bit nervous despite it being likely she says no. It hasn't been an unnatural amount of time, but I don't want to wonder for too long either.\n\nI'm sorry if I've already gotten the response that I deserve, i.e. \"she's not interested, move on\".

    "selftext": "Just for some background: I work retail, and this weekend is of course Easter, meaning shops shut early for Good Friday. In the case of our shop, in the run up to Easter, we were told that we would shut at 6pm and not 8pm as we normally do. This was clearly displayed on our door signs, flyers and adverts. \n\n  Skip forward to today and it turns out that thanks to some manager bollocks there was a mass panic when it turns out we were opening until 8pm, and the realisation was that there were not enough staff. I was asked to do an extra 2 hours on top of my timetabled shift (2-6) to mean I'd be there to close up. I said no, did my shift as planned and went home. \n\n  I got home around 6.30pm, and got into a conversation with a family member I'll call Roberta. She asked me, as usual, about work. The conversation went roughly like this: \n\n&gt;**Roberta**: how was work? \n\n&gt;**me**: [tells them about the whole palaver with the opening times]\n\n&gt; **Roberta**: so why didn't you say yes to the extra hours then?! \n\n&gt; **me**: because I was told I was working until 6, and that's what I did. \n\n&gt;**Roberta**: your attitude is terrible you know that? You've gone through life getting things far too easily! Most people would be grateful of the extra hours! When I think back to when I worked, I worked such long hours, plenty of it unpaid and unthanked. \n\n*cue a small rant for a few minutes in the same vein* \n\n Now this really got to me. Was I given a lot growing up and now? Probably, but I never expected it or demanded it from anyone- as far as I was concerned, if I was given something then I was grateful for such, but at the same time if I was expected to pay my own way so to speak, I did. \n\n  Plus what equally irritated me beyond belief was the fact that in the past I've done more than my fair share at work- I've come in at stupidly short notice (my record being 15min), stayed behind for hours on end to cover for sickness and absences, gone halfway across the country at 12 hours notice as assistance at another store, often stayed way past my timetabled finish time to do stuff and so on. I've given more than enough to my job for free. Much of it was never acknowledged, much less rewarded with anything other than stress. \n \n\n Although I didn't say it, my entire rationale for refusing the hours was because unlike many of my colleagues, I don't see doing ungodly amounts of hours as some badge of pride, which Roberta did, and the sum total of my waking day isn't ever going to be about work. As the saying goes, I work to live, not live to work. Many of the people I work with literally get up, come to work and then go home again to repeat the whole thing again. That to me isn't a life. I honestly deeply considered asking Roberta as to what she'd gotten out of it other than some slightly higher numbers on a bank statement. \n\nSo, was I being the asshole? ",

Robert said \"Hey john can you stop calling them chubbies because i feel that's pretty damn insulting\"(please keep in mind we have been calling them like this for like 1month already)   but i responded  \"No im not, they don't have names yet\" in my mind i also thought if we called them humans we would confuse them with other characters.\nThen Robert said \"can you not call them chubbies though, i think it can offend some people\" and i said \"I don't see the word chubby as offensive, so no sorry\".\n\nthen Robert kept insisting and insisting and he said \"Can you call them the famous guys or the friendly guys?\" i said \"No\" Robert kept insisting saying\"Also calling them chubbies is just an insult when you could be calling them other things, you keep sticking to that rather then something not so insulting and offensive\"\n\n and at this point im really bugged that he keeps insisting even though i already gave him a decent answer so i responded \"The word chubby should not be seen as negative, i already answered you and you keep insisting, even if i stopped saying chubby it would be because of you, and that would make me feel that im not talking how i normally would just because you see the word chubby as negative and offensive\"       Robert then called me \"close minded and rude\" \n\n\n\nRobert is skinny. This is not work, but a team of enthusiast trying  to make a game.\nI don't see me calling them chubby as insulting, yeah he asked me to call them something else but i felt that was really not necessary. we have called them like this for like  1 month.\n\nill try to answer when possible.\n\nSo guys! do you agree to Robert's point of view or John point of view about this argument?\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                               CONCLUSION:\n\n\n\n\nSo thanks to you guys i realized an important thing, you must respect culture difference, the first problem was that i never thought it that way, i always thought saying chubby guys and chubbies was literally the same thing.  Second thing was that in latinoamerica saying \"negrito\" or \"gordito\" (blackie and fatty) is not a bad thing, it's even a kindier and friendly way of talking to someone, specially family and friends.\n\nbut i do see this was a CULTURE DIFFERENCE problem and that if im talking in english I MUST RESPECT and understand that when saying this things in english(blackie, fatty,chubbies),  can offend someone. \nWhen i argued with Robert all i heard was: chubby is something negative and if you are calling someone chubby guy or chubbies you are instantly offending them. and that's why i didn't want to stop calling them \"chubbies\", because i thought he just thinks being chubby person is bad, what he meant is saying chubbies is bad. \n\nThanks everyone for hearing this weird story. i must add that me and Robert are ok now, we talked about it and figured out we just misunderstood each other.  the team will keep calling them chubby guys until we have a name for them and Robert is fine with this. saying  the word \"chubbies\" will be stopped.",

    "selftext": "\n\nI'll start at the beginning. My best friend \"Ruby\", breaks up with her long time douche bag of a boy friend, only to soon enter into a relationship with a \"secret guy\". . . For about 5 mouths she's seeing this person and she won't let anyone know anything about them. I don't really know what to think. \n\nTurns out; this person is a guy Ruby works with who was on the outs in his marriage.  \" Jack\" was going through a divorce,  and thats the reason for all the secrecy,  they wanted to be discrete until it was final. Come to find out Jack's  marriage had really end privately much sooner. He and his former wife have two young daughters together. \n \nSkip to about two mouths later, she is now moving in with him and they have a one bedroom apartment already to go. Again a total surprise.  His two girls will have the room and they make the living room into a studio like place. Honestly the apartment looks amazing, it's really put together nicely.  \n\nHere's the catch,  Jack  doesn't feel like it's good for the girls, who are over Sunday and Monday nights, to know hes with Ruby yet. I understand that, it's a lot to take in, a new routine and a new house. Mom and dad aren't together anymore, this is dads place this is mom's place, dad picks you up this time, drops you off at that time. I understand need time for the to adjusts before introducing Ruby to them. \n\nSo Ruby now is stuck in a situation were although she pays for half of everything and takes on the majority of the house hold chores, she is without a place every Sunday and Monday night. And she has asked me to stay over on Sundays (since I always have Sundays off) and shell sleep with another friend on Mondays. I agree obvously because she my best friend.  I really want this to work for Ruby because this is what she wants. And I'm thinking if shes really going though with all this I want her meeting the kids, incorporating into their lives and routines to go well. \n\nI live in a single , it's decent sized but definitely ment for one person or perhaps a couple. But I'm a single 30 year old gay man, who now has his best friend sleeping in his bed every Sunday for the last 4 mouths. At 1st we'd still see eachother though out the week a few hours here or there. But the last month or so, we now only hang out and chill, on sundays. Which I actually totally understand. Ruby is a very hard working, honest and careing person. She has  now taken on two jobs and has started going to trade school. Her weeks M-F have turned into 20 days! It's wild and it's crazy and yet Ruby does it. Getting 4 hours sleep most nights.  She's incredible, I know I couldn't do it. Within this last month as well. on Sundays shes been meeting up with Jack and his girls at the park and is starting to get acquainted with them.  Needless to say by the time we meet up, shes normally tired and knocking out by 630.\n\nIt's kinda sucks beacuse Sundays are also my day off also and when we now meet up its specifically for her to get comfortable and to go to sleep. I started to feel like my Sundays were being hijacked and I had to be available to let her in. I also was leaving for a weekend trip to Mexico for a family party. So I decided to make her a set of keys. So she could use my place while I was gone. On Sunday and that Monday of she wanted. \n\nNow im back from Mexico,  of course Ruby is busy and can't see me until the next Sunday. Which is a bummer , but whatever. So Sunday rolls around and we text in the morning and shell be ready to meet up around 5pm. So I make plans and go out for lunch with some friends have a few drinks after and I realize its 6 and I haven't heard from Ruby. I throw her a text and grab some dinner before heading home without hearing from her. I walk into my apartment and there's Ruby and she looks kinda shocked. She says, ugh she called me,  ugh she means, replied to my text , but that accidently never sent,  and when she didn't hear back she just let herself in.. . Honestly it kinda bothered me she came in to my place without me knowing. Not that I think she is up to anything shady, but  it was just very inconsiderate.. .   I ask her if she wanted to go grab one more round with me across the street before going to bed but she had plans to go eat with another friend (Monday Night person) just as she says this, her phone rings she answers,  declares she'll be right out , and proceeds to leave. We say good bye, but I'm left feeling at odds about this whole situations now. \n\nI haven't actually seen her in over 2 weeks. I just had this epic adventure she cares to hear nothing  about, she doesn't give me the opportunity to give her the momentos I got for her. I haven't heard anything,  really about her life either. How it was going meeting the kids, how's your life balance right now, blah blah blah. I'm feeling annoyed as I go through  what happened and how I think her intention was to slip into my apartment drop her shit off and bounce before I got home. Only to come back and pass out. Which to be honest would be fine if she was up front.    But she lied and was acting all weird and I'm staring to feel really used. And as I go back through the last few weeks before my vacation I've been feeling taken advantage of. \n\nI text Ruby that id like to have tonight to myself,  if since she was already with Monday night friend, if she could asked if she can sleep over there tonight as well. She agrees and stops by to grab her stuff which i placed by the door. \n\nRuby text me a few days later asking if everything was alright, and I told her how i was feeling and that I didn't want to her to stay over on Sundays any longer.  \n\nWe exchanged words unfortunately mostly with  passive aggressive over tones. She's hurt I'm throwing her out, but I'm feeling like it's been 4 months. I agree it's soon to fully incorporate into their lives and routines  of Jack and his kids but you moved into a house together. I feel like she should sleep at the place she pays rent to have, and not mine. I mean I helped out but it's too much now, and I'm starting to resent Ruby and Jack for that matter for putting us in this situation.  \n\nRuby doesn't think it's any of my business the way they run their relationship,  and I'm inclined to agree, but take me out of the equation then. And I won't have an investment in it. \n\nI dont know, Am I being the Asshole?\n",

    "selftext": "Been going to the gym about a month now and there's this guy we'll call A. He struck up a conversation with me the second I entered the gym on my first day. He'd seen me in the halls at school and I figured I'd give him a shot because it's always easier to work out with someone as opposed to alone. Right off the bat I noticed that he just came off as wayyyyy too eager to be friends, but I'm a patient person and try to be understanding. \n\nWe're stretching, talking about our fitness goals because it's both of our first times at the gym. I knew I was in for a shitshow when he drops one or two comments about how he's considering injecting *synthol*, which is basically fake muscles and messes up your body a ton. We go through my full body routine and we agree to meet again in two days (Mon/Wed/Fri). \n\nHe texts me 20 minutes before we are supposed to meet at the gym for our next session and says he's not going to the gym anymore because it's \"too hard\" and \"the struggle is real\". I wrote him off right then and there. It's one thing to struggle with motivation, but when you start talking about injecting crap into your body you don't need and have no idea how to use on top of that, I write you off as lazy with fitness.\n\nThe following session, I'm there alone, stretching. He walks up to me in street clothes and asks if I forgot about him. I told him he bailed and he was like \"Nahhhh I'm just adjusting my routine and diet. I was just messing with you dude. I'll be back Monday.\" I knew instantly that he was lying, but I didn't really care.\n\nEver since then, he comes to the gym 2-3 days a week and just kinda walks around and bugs people. He does like 2-3 single sets of bicep exercises in like an hour and a half. The rest of the time is spent just walking around looking at stuff and talking to people clearly just trying to exercise (earbuds in, not engaging in conversation, etc.). He doesn't stretch, he does most of his exercises in jeans and doesn't even change, and just pesters people. He's not mean, but he's very annoying. He gives others unwanted advice, despite not knowing basic information himself.",

    "selftext": "So my buddy and I were hanging out and he is playing around and grabs a cup full of coins that I keep in my truck. He runs inside and locked the door but eventually let me in. So I am looking around trying to find it and he said it was in a cabinet (It was really in the refrigerator). So I jokingly say tell me or I'll get you in a rear-naked choke. So I grab him and he says you can't choke me out so I tightened it and like any untrained person tried to pry my forearm off. I didn't know how tight it really was until his hands fell to the side. \n\nHe was only unconscious for a few seconds and seemed fine afterwards. I am genuinely apologetic and even offer to let him choke me out and give him my back, but he didn't. He said he wasn't mad and even wanted to get food afterwards. I actually was late and had to leave and he tells me he thought he was pointing to the fridge but both his arms were on my forearm.\n\nFast forward to now and he hasn't texted me back once when I ask what he is doing. He doesn't respond in my friends group chat. He didn't even take my offer to buy him some alcohol (He loves old Jack Daniels). So AITA for accidentally doing that to my friend, and do you think I can repair our friendship? \n\nTLDR: My friend was messing around and took so coins from my car. I accidentally choked him and he passed out. He never tapped out and never took his hands from my forearm. He was only out for a few seconds and seemed fine. Now he won't respond to me. AITA? ",

I'll try to be as neutral as possible, but this can't be done perfectly.**\n\nThe story starts on April 5. I'm (I may refer to myself as $me if my name comes up in the third person) playing with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with my friend, we'll call him $friend. So we're playing CS:GO, and everything is going fine. However, mid-way through our game, he says, \"Hold on, $girlfriend is calling. I'll be back in a few,\" to which I respond with, \"Ok, I'll talk to you in a few.\" Fast-forward to 20 minutes later, and the game's over. He's still not back on the Discord server. I don't want to play alone, so I get off my PC and watch some TV. \n\nSince he's pretty busy playing music, we only get to talk to each other maybe 2 times during the week, and once on the weekend. Since he's busy during the rest of the week, I have no one to play with for the next 2 days. (So I'm pretty upset). On that Friday, I send him [this](http://imgur.com/a/cJDQ4) PM on Discord. He acknowledges his faux pas and I say it's fine and we go on. Again, we're taking the TARDIS to the future, on April 15. Same thing, and I, in an act of anger, torment him through a Steam message. Something along the lines of \"Remember when Rose wasn't gonna let go but then she did right after? Kinda relevant\". This was my fault, and I didn't think it through. So now I'm an asshole. \n\nToday, he comes back, and we play more CS. Now, in an allusion to Groundhog Day, it happens *again*. He says something's come up with $girlfriend, and he has to go again. So here I am writing this post to see your opinions. I have definitely made my mistakes and blunders with this, but I think he could have been a bit more considerate and said, \"Let me finish this game with $me, then I'll call you back $girlfriend. Is that alright?\" \n\nThanks for reading. If there is any clarification needed, I'll try my best to add without giving out privacy issues to either myself, $girlfriend or $friend. \n",

They are trying to fill the pots and want to pour the potting soil rather than use a spade to shovel\nIt in. \n\nThe problem is that the bag is heavy. So my daughter suggests asking me to lift it and do it.

The bag is not too heavy, but it is unwieldy and I don't trust how strong the plastic is. So I take the spade and shovel dirt in. \n\n\"No. I don't need you to do that. We can do that. We need your muscles.\" my wife interjects impatiently. \n\nWithout saying a word, I try to lift the bag, but I don't see a good place to grab it where I could control it. I pick up the spade  again to shovel more dirt in to lighten the bag. \n\n\"No!\" She says. \"I want you to lift it. I don't need you to mansplain how to do it!\"\n\nMind you, I haven't said a word at this point. Also, while sometimes mansplaining is sometimes a thing, the term is also usually used incorrectly to bully and demean men. \n\nI was very offended by this.

    "selftext": "First some background. The roommate was paired with me through a housing program. We're both in an affordable housing unit for poor youth. He's generally a nice guy, if frustratingly dumb a lot of the time.\n\nI do most of the upkeep/chores around the house, mainly because he's only here for a few days at a time. He clearly doesn't need this place as much as someone who's truly got nowhere to go.\n\nYesterday night he texts me to say he lost his house keys. This isn't the first time this has happened. The last time, I went out of my way to buy him a new key and get home ASAP to help him out. Turned out he left the keys in the bathroom. When we sorted it out he just went on and never paid me back. (In general he's pretty awful about paying me back or splitting costs on shared items.)\n\nAnyway, he texts me at 11:45 pm. No clue why that night late, though it's not totally surprising since he keeps weird hours and, again, isn't very bright. By rights he can't expect me to be up that late, so I ignore it. When I wake up I see a missed call from him at 1:30 am and he's sending another text. It's 6:20 am at this point. I still ignore him. (I should point out he's done this sort of thing to me when I've tried to reach him regarding a problem at the house or a mess he made.)\n\nFinally he calls me around 6:45 am and I feel obliged to answer. All this time the gist of his messages has been \"lost my keys, please help, at bare minimum leave the backdoor unlocked so I can get in.\" I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to help like last time, but I agree to leave the door unlocked. I encourage him to get a new key from management and we hang up.\n\nFast forward to tonight and I get a text at 9:15 pm saying, and I quote, \"didn't get a chance to get to the office.\" He wants me to leave the door unlocked again (possibly overnight). I tell him flatly \"no\" and leave it there. No followup texts/calls on either side.\n\nEdits: Since people were wondering/misunderstanding below, I'll definitely say that leaving the door unlocked was looking like both a dangerous proposition (risking someone sneaking into the house, not matter how unlikely) and just enabling the roommate to just subsist without actually solving the key problem. He wasn't standing right outside or suggesting a time to meet, he just wants the door left unlocked indefinitely. My feeling is he had all of yesterday to get new keys and blew it off. No clue why didn't do what any normal person would and get the keys ASAP, but he's made his bed at this point.\n\nEdit 2: I mentioned that he's dumb specifically because it speaks his behavior patterns, our roommate dynamic and his likelihood to understand or appreciate a more elaborate answer than \"no\" from me.\n\nTL, DR - Roommate uses the place like a flop house, lost his keys for the second time, was let in by me this morning and had a whole day to get things straight. He blew it and I won't help him again.\n\nWho's the a-hole?\n\nFinal Edit: Not sure if this is against the spirit of AITA, but I felt like I should offer a PS. For what it's worth, the guy came home Wednesday with no issue. We exchanged pleasantries Thursday night and there's been no bad blood. Make of that what you will.",

    "selftext": "I got rid of my Facebook account over a year ago. I am particularly private as my mother and I are estranged and I didn't want there to be a viral presence for her to find. Initially, I set things up to private but then got annoyed when MIL started with her constant tagging and shitposting. (She is a 60+ retired person who thinks that FB *is* the Internet.)\n\nSo flash forward, my husband and I have a kid. If my husband sent his mother a picture of the kid, it went on Facebook. I told my husband to not send her pictures if he doesn't want them on the Internet. He agrees. \n\nHe was excited about a particularly cute picture and sent it to her. So there it goes, immediately as her profile picture. I was on the iPad, so I saw her incoming message of \"Oh, how cute!\" and I immediately tracked down her facebook page. My suspicions were correct, as the timestamp showed that she updated her profile picture before she even responded to my husband's text message. \n\nSo I thought I was overreacting to the situation and I tried to get over it. When I went over to drop my son off today, she had gotten the picture printed on a canvas and hung it on the wall. To be clear, I have no issue with her printing the photo in question to hang in her home. What I do have an issue with is that she took a picture that was sent to her privately, and then posted it publicly. Additionally, she seems to think that because I don't have facebook, she NEEDS to share pictures of him and that I won't find out since I don't have facebook. It makes me think that she knows what she is doing is crappy, but thinks she can get away with it. \n\nIf she had taken the picture herself, during her time with my son, I wouldn't mind. I know that I can't control that aspect of her life. But I do feel that she lacks respect when it comes to my own privacy concerns. Looking for some opinions on this because I may be taking it the wrong way. \n\nEdit: Had a conversation with the MIL and expressed my feelings. She understood where I was coming from and offered an apology. I said it wasn't necessary to take it down, she shouldn't have to limit her posting since it's her \"thing\" and to ask permission next time. And to double check her privacy settings so her things aren't public. Thanks to everyone who gave their 2 cents. ",

She said it was for the entire family to share. Today, my younger brother came in with the last piece. It wasn't small. Seeing as I hadn't had any yet, I asked if I could have a piece. He claims he also hadn't had any until now, and started whining, saying it's his, he doesn't want to share. I'm annoyed because he always takes things from me without permission. I kept on insisting he give me piece, because mother said it was for everyone to share and I hadn't had any yet. Then he spit on the cake to 'claim' it, and I spit on it too to 'claim' it back. But then he threw it away. Fast-forward a few hours later, he sees I have this flavoured pretzels thing. He demands I give him some, I refuse. He starts attacking and hitting me, trying to grab it and just being unruly around my room, it escalates and I keep on fending him off. He argues that our mother bought it for both of us, even though she just gave it to me and didn't tell me that. Regardless, she asks me to give him some, but I still refuse, because of the cake.

His logic is that since it was bought for both of us, I should share. But so was the cake. He says it's different because that was 'his' piece of the cake, but that piece was the entirety of the remaining cake which still had to be shared.\n\nTLDR; brother didn't share cake with me, demands I share pretzels with him, both items were bought to be shared\n\n(I think the issue is of portion. To him, the entire cake is to be shared, but when he takes a (large) slice, that's his part. But that large slice was all that was left, and I still hadn't had any. So it wasn't a slice of a whole that he was entitled to, it was the (new) whole. Whereas the pretzels are still a whole that he feels entitled to a piece of.)",

Our plan is for me to follow her to wherever she goes to study and live together in the new city, since I'm not that attached to my current job or city.  I've been applying to jobs in the city where she's studying since she got her acceptance letter, but I haven't gotten a job offer yet.\n\nToday: she texts me and says she wants me to not be mad, but she already told a guy in the city she would move in with him. It's a guy who was looking for a roommate on Craigslist for a 1 bedroom apt. near the University.  He would sleep in the living room and she would have the bedroom. he's a student so he would leave in a year. Girlfriend would sign a 1-year lease.  I was kind of bothered when she told me that. I said I didn't think this was not good and asked why she only talked to me about this after she had already made the decision.\n\nWhere I'm coming from: I'm kind of today about the guy roommate thing, since I don't really know who this Craigslist guy is or anything.  And I'm kind of upset about the 1-year lease, since it means if I do want to go there to be with her we would have to live apart and it would also cost more.\n\nWhere she's coming from: she's an adult, and id this guy turns out to be shady she can always call the police. She will save money by sharing a 1-bedroom apartment with another person. And, if I cannot find a job in the city, it will be important for her to have a reasonably priced place to live without me.\n\nSo: am I the asshole for being unhappy about this news?",

    "selftext": "The relationship between myself and my in-laws has gone from cordial to non-existent.  My Husband and I have been married for 12 years; we met, married 6 months later, moved to Dubai 2 months after our wedding for 4 years and have lived in New York for the last 8 years.  I did not get a lot of time to get to know them so the relationship was cordial with his Mom but great with his sister (the one getting married) -- we got along well from the start and developed a friendship.  I considered Ann to be my little sister.   While in Dubai, I would send \"treat boxes\" back home to his Mom and siblings on a MONTHLY basis.  Inside, I'd include local snack items, jewelry, clothing - anything I found interesting and thought they may enjoy.  My goal was to 1.  Build a relationship and 2. integrate myself into the family by showing I was not trying to \"take\" Charles away from them.  As a reward, for our first Christmas, Elphaba (Charles' Mom) send HIM a huge box of treats from the States, clothing, knickknacks and I got a pair of underwear with the $1.99 price tag from Marshalls  still attached.\n\n\nFast forward 4 years and we are back in the States permanently.  My Husband (Charles) and I had tried, unsuccessfully, to start a family but it just would not happen.  We suffered through 3 miscarriages and many false starts.  Charles would share what was going on with Elphaba which was fine.  \n\n\nChristmas 2010 - We host the Holiday celebration at our home for both families.  There would be a total of 30 people staying at our home for roughly a week.  I spent months planning meals, activities, crafts and the like to keep everyone happy and in the Holiday spirit.  Charles Aunt, Jem, said she would fly out a week early to assist with prep work and just to hang out (LOVE HER).  Over dinner and drinks, Jem informs us that Elphaba secretly hates me and has told the entire family (all of which were on their way) over DINNER in a public restaurant that I was having problems getting pregnant because I was \"broken\" and that she wishes Charles would leave me and get with a fertile lady, that all I do is sit home and spend Charles' money (I am educated and had my OWN money before getting married). There were MANY other things said but these were Obviously I was heartbroken but it all made sense.  I always felt a coldness from Elphaba but I just assumed she was slow to warm up and since we were back from Dubai, we would have time to grow a relationship.  I took Ann aside and she confirmed her Mom hates me for no good reason and slanders my name at any and every given chance.  During Elphaba's stay at our home, I was very quiet and withdrawn from her, too quiet I suppose, so she decides to pour gasoline on the fire.  She tells me of all of the celebrities and family friends who are pregnant (I'd had a miscarriage in Oct), complained about the food, too salty, flavorless and ugly (?!?) Charles was LIVID and iced his Mom out during the entire trip.  On her last day, he (privately) confronted her about her behavior.  \n\n\nHere's the best part.  My little sister Ann?  She totally FLIPPED the script once she returned to Florida (their home).  She told Elphaba that Jem and I cornered her and made her say those things were true.  She accused me of destroying their family because Charles has nothing much to do with them anymore and gave him an ultimatum which, duh!, obviously he chose me.\n\n\n2012 - We get pregnant!  And it sticks!!  We are expecting triplets and are both, nervous and over the moon.  I never received a Congrats (phone call, text, pigeon post) - nothing from Elphaba and her flying monkey Ann.  Note:  These are the FIRST grandchildren in the family from her only Son.  They day they were born, I called Elphaba and told here that I am putting the BS aside, and that I wanted her to be apart of her grand kids lives.  I offered to buy her plane ticket but she said to hold off.\n\n\n\n2016- Ann texts Charles to tell him that she is engaged.\n\n\nPresent day - Our kids are turning 5 next month.  They have met Elphaba and Ann once for 1 whole hour.  There are no calls to check on their progress, no birthday cards, skype, nothing.  This really bothered me for awhile, but Im at peace with not having the crazy drama in my life.  \n\n\nAnn texts Charles in February letting him know that her wedding will be in early May (THE SAME WEEKEND OF MY KIDS BIRTHDAY) and that she wants the kids to be apart of her big day.  The kids and I are not attending. \n\n\nAITA? for not wanting Charles to attend? The wedding is on the same weekend we are celebrating our children's birthday and Charles would have to fly, rent a car, hotel etc. and I'd be responsible for setting up for OUR kids party -alone, not to mention this cuts into precious family time AND eliminates a few of the birthday activities we have planned.",

My group of friends at university always seem to have a whacky or crazy factoid that will totally shock me.

Now if you saw my last post you might remember I struggle with anger, not externally so much as being angry on the inside. I try actively to come across calm and polite when disagreeing, and I still think I definitely am quite gentle about it, but the moment I question it, they get aggressively defensive. Alot of the times this will happen I decide it isn't worth risking the friendship over me disagreeing with something, even if I do think it's wrong. I try my best to get this point across by telling them \"yeah I don't really know alot on the subject, just sounded odd, that's pretty cool\".

    "selftext": "I had a crush on this girl since freshman year of college. We got to know each other a bit over the years and I finally got her number when I was entering my senior year. We exchanged texts regularly for a month or two until she asked me out to lunch. I agreed (obviously) and drove over on the agreed day to pick her up. We got along so well that day and I felt a connection, almost as though she was also kinda interested in me.\n\nThat same day she brought up the idea of us seeing a movie together sometime. I was convinced that whatever was going on would lead to something between us, in my head all i had to do was make a move. The movie thing happened a couple of weeks later. We spent the entire day together and also had dinner together that same day. That night we ran into some friends of ours and had drinks together. Time came to drop her home, and I did but I couldn't find the courage in me to make a move that night. Something inside me told me that the time wasn\u2019t right and I thought that I felt a bit of disappointment radiating from her as she jumped out the car.\n\nI needed a third date, to redeem myself. She had left the country for about a month.  I mentioned to someone how much I liked this girl and how much we\u2019d been hanging out, and she ended up finding out what I\u2019d been saying. When she got back, she made it evident that we weren't as close as I thought we were. We shared a class that semester but she wouldn't even acknowledge my existence anymore for some reason. Almost as though we didn't even know each other. She would sit with another friend of hers far away from where I sat. This just left me confused and slightly hurt. She'd also leave class without even looking my way. Every time I tried to get her to hang out she gave some sort of excuse. It was tough but she agreed somewhere down the line. It was a dinner date. We had tons of fun and after when I was dropping her off, I made the move just as I'd planned in my head for a while. I thought she hesitated in the car for a while after saying goodbye so in that moment I went for it. I motioned her for a kiss. She agreed, And we made out for the first time.\n\nAfter this it went back to the mind games, almost as though we didn't even know each other. We still spoke through text though. I had asked her why she would act so distant when we were around other people e.g. pretended that she didn't know me but she only gave some excuse each time. Getting her to hang out again was near impossible to the point that I almost gave up but when she finally agreed to hang out it wasn't just the two of us. She invited another friend of hers too. That evening we had dinner, all three of us and after I dropped both of them off to her place. Of course nothing happened that night.\n\nAfter I'd given up on asking her to go on another date with me, she later asked me to take her out for coffee. This was about a month after the previous time we hanged out. I foolishly agreed. I was oblivious to the signs of disinterest as I thought all it needed was a bit of effort since nothing good comes easy. I took her out to coffee and again we spent almost the entire day together having a good time, and after it got kinda late, I dropped her home. I saw another opportunity to make a move outside her home, and just as I was about to, she revealed to me that she was in a relationship. And that she had been all this time, with another girl (she's bi). Now is when she was telling me. Like Seriously.jpg?! My mind was already set on kissing her and we still ended up making out, for the second time now. This time I escalated things slightly (lots of touching/foreplay/ fondling). She seemed into it at the moment although she declined to let me into her place. All this was happening in the car. We said our goodbyes and I headed home. I sincerely thought things were still going in an OK direction, even after she revealed this new information. After this night, virtually every attempt of getting her to hang out was pretty much impossible, unless it really benefited her like this one time I gave her a car ride to her friends place after dinner. She joked to her friend that I was her Uber (lol).\n\nNot long after, she had plans to visit another city. The friend that was originally supposed to go with her had something come up. So she asked me if I could take her, she wasn\u2019t from the country so she really needed to go with someone. I agreed to (of course). It was a 14 hour bus ride. During the ride turns out I wasn't even the second choice option as she had asked a bunch of people to go with her and all declined or were busy. Yet here I was being controlled by foolish emotions and doing everything she wished.\n\nWe finally got to our destination and would be staying at a friend's of hers who lived in that city. Her friend had to work in the morning so he went straight to sleep. Her and I were now alone sitting on a couch just talking. I said something along the lines of \"We haven't made out in a while\" and tried to kiss her. She turned me down. I was kinda surprised, confused and slightly upset. She said that what she needed was a friend as she was sad since she had recently broken up with her gf.\n\nI still couldn't believe it, I thought I'd give it another shot the next day but she shut it down again and was like \u201cIs this why you came?\u201d. At that moment I practically gave up perusing her for good (kinda late, I know). We went about the rest of the trip just fine, as friends. After we got back from the trip we didn't talk over text much. The next time I saw her was out at a bar where one of my friend's worked, we'll call him Josh. I guess her and Josh were introduced to each other through a mutual friend. Things were a bit awkward between us, we still partied that night though, together with a bunch of our other friends. Josh and I engaged in a conversation and he tells me that he heard from her that I was being aggressive. Apparently she told him this when he asked her how the trip was. They got to know each other just the other day yet she was already telling him this about me. I felt a sense of betrayal. It made me wonder who else she was saying such things to. I confronted her about it later that night when we went to spend the night at Josh's home but I just couldn't shake this feeling of anger/betrayal. I felt that my name was being tarnished.\n\nThe next day when I was home and sober I sent her an angry text message along the lines of \"So you went telling everyone that I was being aggressive? Nice. Give them half the story!\". She responded with \"I didn't say you were being aggressive, I said pushy. Isn't it true you tried something on the first night?\" And with that she swiftly blocked me and unfollowed me on social media before I even got to respond. I got upset. But I realized I had already suffered enough and decided to let her go. I made the decision that I will no longer chase. Later I heard from someone else closer to her, that she had told her she even felt threatened (the night I tried to make a move and she declined). I can promise that she didn't show signs of feeling threatened, as things went on normally after. I never forced her to do anything she didn't want to and I backed off the moment she turned me down. I sent a message to one of her friends saying how she is a POS and I also said things like I hope she dies etc. I was heartbroken and angry.\n\nThis all happened months ago and as I sit here I wonder if I was the asshole. Should I have apologized for attempting to make a move? Even though we had already made out like two other times? I was the pursuer, so am I purely on the wrong based alone on that? And also for lashing out and saying such horrible things about her? \nOr am I still just falling into her game?\n",

About a week into our relationship, I asked her about it. I was bulimic in college so I started by telling her my story and asking if she also had issues with food. Since then we've has a very open dialogue about her eating issues. I have learned so many recipes that she finds appetizing and have helped her find a good therapist. I have worked hard to keep her accountable without shaming her.\n\nImportant for later: One of the hardest parts is that she has an incredibly hard time talking about this stuff. The first time we talking about it, there was a lot of crying and long pauses as she tried to even get the words out. She couldn\u2019t even tell her therapist at first. I urged her to initiate with an email.\n\nOne quick side note is that Jane was a dancer. She was a modern dance major in college and movement is how she connects to the world most strongly. Unfortunately she has had bad knees since her senior year of college and is very limited. She can't remember the last time her knee's weren't in at least a little pain. The only exercise she can do at this point is yoga, and even that can be excruciating sometimes. She feels trapped in a defective body.\n\nSO, cut to Jane\u2019s best friend Angela, who is on this huge fitness kick. She has a whole separate instagram dedIcated to fitness. She can't go a sentence without talking about how she's \"doing the whole 30\" and she greets you like \"hey sorry I'm sweaty, I just came from xyz work out class.\" She is just a generally braggadocios person. Anytime someone talk about diet and exercise, it takes Jane\u2019s mind to dark places. Many of her early friendship ended because she and the other girl got weirdly competitive about their bad eating habits. Jane has worked really hard on trying to rewire her brain and grow and not let conversations like that affect her, but its still hard. It has all been exacerbated by the fact that Jane can\u2019t so much as go for a jog without being in pain. \n\n Story\nEvery time that Jane hangs out with Angela, she rants to me about how Angela dominates the conversation with stories of how sore she is, and how healthy she\u2019s been eating. I always tell her to confront Angela, but again Jane has a really hard time bringing this stuff up. This last time I offered to talk to Angela to get the ball rolling. Jane agreed and gave me permission to reach out.\n\nSo I called Angela and did my best to handle the situation as delicately  as possible. I started by saying \"hey theres something sensitive Jane deals with and the only reason I know about it is because I confronted her about it\" and I brought up the eating stuff and Angela very matter-of-factly replied \"oh I know\" (which, if you've known, then why never bring it up as a point of concern!?!? but whatever). I proceed to let her know that the fitness and diet stuff is a sensitive area for Jane and that while I do not believe Angela was doing anything wrong by talking about something she's proud of (&lt;- and I really emphasized this point), I thought she might want to know that this was hard for Jane, and I wanted to put it on her radar. At this point she becomes incredibly defensive. Talking about how fitness makes up a huge portion of her life and she can\u2019t just not talk about it. She then goes \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re asking me to do?\u201d. Its a weird conversation where my ultimate message is, \u201chey, I just wanted to put this on your radar so that you guys can have a conversation about this\u201d I really truly did my best to make sure it didn\u2019t sound like I was accusing Angela of anything. I love Jane and often do things like this that involve standing up for Jane, but the truth is I\u2019m almost as non-confrontational as she is and do my best to be diplomatic.\n\nThe worst part is what she does after. She texts Jane that she\u2019s very upset and wants to talk. Jane stalls for a while and as Jane is writing out a long text, Angela called and Jane reluctantly answers. As Jane predicted, the conversation starts off with Jane having to apologize. They spend an hour on the phone talking about how Jane handled the situation poorly and how its not my place (as someone who has only been in Jane\u2019s life for 1/6 the amount of time that Angela has) to get in the way of their friendship. She says \u201cI understand that this is hard to bring up, but there must have been a better way\u201d. She keeps saying stuff like \u2018understand what you\u2019re going through and how hard this is (which, no she f*cking doesn\u2019t), but think about me and my feelings and how this all makes me feel\u2019. She talks about how Jane didn\u2019t consider her feelings at all. She goes on to say that this situation just demonstrates the weakness of my character as a bf in thinking that what I did was appropriate. At one point Angela (with not context or background knowledge) accuses me of enabling K\u2019s eating habits. Jane has to defend aspects of her mental health issues to Angela in an attempt to have some sort of leg to stand on. Angela isn\u2019t hearing any of it, she\u2019s only out to prove how much she\u2019s been wronged. Angela basically sidesteps the whole original problem and made herself the victim in all of this. The whole conversation was made out so that Jane was the bad guy and when they hung up all Jane could do was cry.\n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\nAITA for reaching out to someone who supposedly cares about Jane and talking to them about something that is hard for her to put into words? We have spent a long time trying to see it from Angela\u2019s perspective, but we\u2019ve both come to the conclusion that if one of our friend\u2019s S.O.\u2019s reached out to us in this way, we would appreciate that this was a sensitive topic and understand that the comment was coming out of a place of \u201chey we\u2019re all on the same team in caring about this person\u201d.\n\n\nMy personal perspective:\n\nIt feels like she doesn\u2019t want to feel guilty so she\u2019s doing all of these were emotional/logical gymnastics to make herself the victim.\nI have never thought of Angela as a good friend. I think she is a narcissist and doesn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s feelings if it conflicts her ego. A few months Jane texted me this long essay about how she feels alone and how me and her mom are the only ones who ask her how she\u2019s doing and how her day is going and how even though she is consistently checking up on Angela. Angela only ever talks about herself. \nWhen Jane went to her Grandmothers funeral she came home and was super exhausted from her flight. Angela asked if Jane was coming to her Super Bowl party (which started only a few hours after Jane landed). Jane let her know that she was super tired and just wanted to sleep. Angela, who KNEW that Jane had been at her grandmother\u2019s funeral and spent the weekend with her emotionally abusive father, replied with a passive-aggressive \u201cok, whatever\u201d and didn\u2019t ever ask how Jane was feeling, not during the weekend, not before or after.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even want to be in the same room as her. I\u2019m not going to tell Jane which friends to cut of or which to keep, because I feel like that crosses the line between protective and controlling. I just feel like Angela is a toxic friend and Jane deserves better.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this became more of a rant than an AITA, but I would still love your feedback. While I obliviously think I\u2019m in the right, I\u2019m very open to different perspectives.",

Problem is, my vodka mix came in a full-size cup instead of the half-size I asked for. I immediately point out the mistake but, *I choose to keep it*, thinking it would be best to keep the drink instead of demanding the correct size, as the one the bartender brought would most likely end up in the trash.    \nSo time goes on and it's time to leave. Everyone paid for their drinks and now it's my turn. The bartender is now trying to charge me the *full-size cup*. Again, I said it was his mistake and he shouldn't charge me full price. He tells me I should have requested a new drink instead. I ask what would he do to the first one. Yup, he would throw it away.\nIn the end I got it my way, but now I'm getting this sense of guilt.

    "selftext": "So long story, my father passed the end of last year and because of that, I inherited about 45k that HE was intended to inherit. \n\nMy father was not a particularly good father, he was barely ever around, never financially supported me. Just made pretty shitty decisions his entire life. Ive always had a very good and mostly normal relationship with his family, especially my long been divorced grandparents. \n\nOnce he went away for a few years when I was in HS our relationship really just became non-existent. He had another son right before he went in with a batshit crazy nutcase who lost custody of all her kids including my \"half brother.\" My aunt (his sister) and uncle adopted kindly his son and he has a WAY better life then he ever would have had. \n\nAfter my dad got out and up until his death we had an OKAY relationship but not too much contact. Meanwhile he was staying with my grandmother. She had always made some pretty bad decisions also, especially financially which is why she now lives a very modest life. \n\nAnyway, to get to the crux of the matter, I inherited this nice little nest egg. I have debt from when I put myself through College, just bought a house with my SO, have $0 savings, and would really like to get married and have my own family. \n\nSince I received that $$, I paid off some high interest debt from school, and put the rest into a savings account. \n\nMy grandmother, whom I love dearly has been hinting at money problems ever since I got this windfall. She had also mentioned a few times that my father would have wanted BOTH of his sons to split the money. My \"brother\", or in the real sense, cousin is now 9 years old and barely even knew my dad as half his life he was in jail and the other half my aunt and uncle were always fighting about it. Also, legally because he was adopted, he isn't legally entitled to anything. \n\nI could put some money in an account for my \"brother\" and help my grandmother out with a couple thousand but that would virtually leave me with very little left. \n\nAnd personally the way I see it is that my grandmother is responsible for her own financial instability and I should definitely not be responsible for trying to rectify her mistakes. If I were a millionaire then I could, but Im just basically starting my life. And my \"brother\" wasn't really even my father's son. He didn't have to put up with all the bullshit. He has a good life with my aunt and uncles family. \n\nAITA for not giving my grandmother and brother some of my inheritance? \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice and insight. It was good to see that the majority of you would do the same as me. Ive paid off a good chunk of debt and I can now breath month to month without the student loan police knocking down my door. The rest will stay in savings until I make a decision on bow best to invest/or save for my future. Thanks  Again!",

    "selftext": "So i have always gotten along perfectly with my friend until i disagreed with one of his political views. I'll refrain from saying what it is just in the interest of keeping the discussion focused on whether i am the asshole or not. \n\nIn truth i am pretty apathetic on the issue. He sent me a political meme along with a laughing emoji. I say \"really? i think (insert opinion here)?\" He replies back to me: \"Dude. you really think that? Like honestly? That's ridiculous.\" He then sends me a handful of angry paragraphs with links after each one. I skim it and reply \"I guess i can see your point\" in hopes of defusing the situation.\n\nI didn't think much of it until the next time we decided to hang out. He asks if I agree with him after what he sent me, and i say no, i do not. He says that he cant believe i would think something so absurd. I tell him i really don't care all that much about the issue, and i think it is fine if he has another opinion. He demands that i explain my reasoning, which i agree to, but am interrupted in absolute rage after a few seconds. He rants about how wrong i am and how stupid it is to hold such an opinion. Trying to be reasonable, i again say that i see where he is coming from. I then make multiple attempts to casually shift the conversation in another direction, to no avail. After the casual route doesn't work i straight up say \"dude, can we just talk about something else? I'm sorry we disagree but i came here to have a good time, not argue.\" He disregards this. Hours go by before i finally make up an excuse to leave.\n\nWe decide to hang out again the next week. After greeting each other the first thing he says is \"Look, about last week dude. I just get really heated when it comes to that topic.\" I reply \"no worries, we have all been there man.\" I am relieved that all is well before he immediately says \"Ya i mean it's just (insert random opinion) really doesn't make any sense to me. Like how can you really believe that and still call yourself a good person?\" \n\nMy stomach turns as i realize what this is about to snowball into. And it DOES. Once again i remain calm and nod my head as he rants (though this time i am getting really mad internally). I ignore the little jabs at my intelligence and questions of my sanity.   He yells he is not done yet when i try to change the topic (At this point i really AM questioning my sanity). When nothing changes after about 40 minutes i once again tell him that i have to leave. He looks at me in disgust and says: \"You're really gonna disregard all the points I've been making?!?! I guess I've been wasting my time here. Go run away again like a fucking COWARD! I though you were better than that!\"\n\nI....freaking....lose it. \"BETTER THAN WHAT?\" i exclaim. The next raging barrage of insults i screamed was something along the lines of \"I'm better than you in every fucking way possible! First of all, you're dumb as fucking rocks! You flunked out of class because you couldn't understand basic fucking courses. Not to mention i have had 3 different girlfriends since we have know each other and you STILL bitch and moan about how lonely you are. I had to stop bringing Sarah (not real name of ex) over because she thought you were a creepy fucking loser. Sucks not having a single ounce of social skills, doesn't it? What more can i be 'better than that' at? The fact that i wipe my ass with your salary? You had daddy's trust fund to fall back on and you still haven't amounted to SHIT! You think i had it that easy? Oh and you got a problem with me saying this? Then throw a punch man. Oh wait, YOU'RE the coward and you KNOW id kick the shit out of you! Don't ever fucking disrespect me like that again! You will always be dirt.\" Absolutely livid, i then stormed out of his house.\n\nObviously i feel terrible about saying all that. If i could take it all back i would. I hate egotistical people, so it was really cringy writing that all out! Though part of me still feels it was justified. I tried my best to conduct myself in a reasonable manner. I gave him every opportunity to chill out, to take the hint, to agree to disagree. Hours upon hours. Eventually i completely blew up and said the worst thing i could to him because he just would...not...stop. So who is it gonna be Reddit?",

    "selftext": "This happened about an hour ago, and I don't know if I was being an asshole in this situation-\n\nTo start this, I'm going to mention that I used to use online dating sites; mainly for a bit of banter to see who was out there (a la \"The Den\"- minus the murders) and then as a form of looking for hookups like I used to do on tinder. I wasn't looking for anything serious, just a bit of fun.\n\nI met this one person, we chatted, exchanged kik usernames (I don't disclose facebook info to people I don't know), and we started talking on skype. There was a bit of webcam stuff (as we live a fair distance apart), but I noticed he was a little bit more serious than I was about it. I was a little bit uncomfortable with that as I really wasn't looking for anything serious at the time. Eventually college, coursework, spending time with my family and issues with my friends ate up a lot of my time, and I didn't have a lot of free time. I told him this and he did message me every so often but the conversations were short lived, so I didn't think he was interested/that bothered as it wasn't serious, and left him alone/moved on (and also got into a relationship)\n\nI got a message from him today saying \"baby\" I sent him \"?\". I also sort of forgot who was messaging me as it had been a while without contact. Had I not noticed the chat logs, i'd have asked who it was and how he got my contact information.\nHe tells me he misses me, I ask him why. He says that he got feelings for me. This kinda annoyed me because him taking something, that was essentially a hookup, over the internet seriously. I told him \"this may seem a little bit dickish, but you only know me over the internet\". He tells me things like \"I enjoyed the time we had even if it was just over the internet\" and I reiterated the point of that fact that it's the fucking internet (and not even a relationship either)-  that he's taking it way too seriously/got attached\". \n\nHe tells me \"I'll leave you alone I guess I'm just being a nuisance\". This one sentence pissed me off more than anything. to me it comes off as playing the 'I'm going to blame myself more than ever to make you feel bad about what you said\". It felt like a guilt trip and I wasn't having it.Then goes on to tell me he didn't take anything seriously, despite what was said while we were chatting previously over skype/kik.... And having told me he has feelings for me 10 minutes prior. \n\nI'm really done with this so I tell him the cold hard truth, that is the fact that A) He barely knows me (if at all) and B) he only knows me online, on ONE website, and TWO apps. That's the extent of the ways we could communicate.\n\nI tell him that getting attached to someone isn't a good idea in most cases. I mean online relationships working out don't really turn out well a lot of the time. He asks what the big deal is, and I tell him it's because it's the motherfucking internet. People don't even take threats online seriously for god's sake. There was some back and forth in which I talked down to him for taking what was going on seriously because in reality, he knows very little about me, if anything at all. \nI tell him to stop messaging me about it, or I'd end up blocking him, and the conversation just ends.\n\nI guess the only thing to ask is was I being an asshole for doing this as I'm in two minds about it.\n\n((Just bear in mind I'd never said I was serious at all, nor had I expressed an interest in having a relationship with him. I feel like if he took our conversations that way, even though I didn't say anything of the sort to him that would make him think that, that's on him and not me))\n",

I have social anxiety and the party was super crowded and I could feel myself beginning to have an anxiety attack. Obviously, I wanted to go home. So I told one of the friends I was with that I wanted to go and she agreed with me because she wasn't feeling great as well. The other friend was furious that I wanted to go home and tried to make me feel guilty and kept saying that I would regret not going. Finally she says it's not fair because she wants to stay downtown and I was going to ruin her night. \n\nI'm arguing back and forth with her on the way to the bus stop, trying my hardest to find a compromise. I told her that I would stay with her until her boyfriend got there and then I would leave but she refused and demanded that I stay the entire time. I said no, I'm having an anxiety attack I need to go home and she just was not having it. For some reason she decided to focus all of her anger on me rather than between me and the other girl who wanted to go home. \n\nFinally, she gets in my face and starts screaming how I'm being selfish and that I'm ruining her night. I'd had it at that point and was crying and super drunk so I yelled \"stop screaming in my fucking ear\". Then she got in my face and screamed \"HAH? Stop screaming in your ear? Stop being so selfish\". So I rolled my eyes, yelled again for her to stop screaming at me and got on the bus. A minute afterward she and the other friend got on the bus and sat as far away as possible from me.

    "selftext": "   Infidelity and dishonesty are my two biggest fears in dating. They are my Achilles heal. Within half a year both of those fears were thrown at me by my girlfriend, who I still love deeply but am very angry with.\n\n   After dating for six months my girlfriend and I had hit a rough patch. I was jealous and insecure and constantly afraid that my girlfriend wasn't being honest. She was in a depression, an alcoholic  and anorexic during this. She only became aware of the alcohol and anorexia two months before we split up. She became very distant and very hard to speak to. I was scared and anxious and acted irrationally by hovering and smothering her.\n\n   A day or two before a big Christmas party with all of our friends she decided a break was in order. During the party she was very snarky with me and refused to open my Christmas gift. I don't bother talking to her the next couple days and on Christmas Eve I'm invited to her mom's house for dinner the next day. After that dinner, which was wonderful, she told me she loved me and that I should come over so we can exchange gifts. Everything was great. The next day she came over in a fuss and broke up with me.\n\n   After about a week and a half she says she misses me. She goes to a residential program for eating disorders, changes drastically for the better. When she came home I had heard from someone that she slept with her roommate (we'll call him Guy) and my friend of many years. I was upset and I confronted her. She told me it was one night and nothing else. I confronted him and he said the same thing. I try to move on and it's going well. During one of my nights of tossing and turning my girlfriend, who is fast asleep, rolls over, moans and says Guy's name. I got very nervous and upset and in my sleepy mind I found it right to look through her phone. I saw that she had cheated on me Christmas night, within an hour of us exchanging gifts. She had been contacting other guys as well. I went back further and saw suspicious texts from an ex and read them. I ruined her privacy and I felt horrible. \n\n   The next morning I woke her up and explained everything and how sorry I was that I went through her phone but that didn't change the fact that I needed answers about everything. Over the next few days I found that she cheated, spent more than one night with Guy in his bed, was doing cocaine behind my back during the beginning of our relationship (she was aware that my father died of a cocaine overdose and that I have a very big problem with it and most hard drugs) and had lied about all of it. \n\n   I had the biggest gut feeling when we started dating that she wasn't being honest and that I had to be careful trusting her. This whole ordeal only reinforced my fears and made me even more inclined to trust my intuition and go with it. She's unbelievably apologetic and wishes she could take it all back. She never wants to hurt me again and doesn't want to spend another day without me.\n\n   The angry side in me is saying, \"you ruined a friendship and created a rift, you lied and cheated and I cant trust you ever again. \n   The optimist in me is saying, \"she's remorseful, she was in a horrible place and Guy was there for comfort, and maybe I can learn to trust again.\n\n   I'm still very angry at her. I know it wasn't HER doing it but her depression and alcoholism that lead to self destructive behaviors. I'm aware that she didn't consciously do this TO me but did it to herself.

No problem, I pick her up from school and I even buy her coffee on the way there. Once we get there she says she'll be 15 mins tops, and I say I'll wait in the car. She says okay, leaves, comes out around 15 minutes later and we drive home. A couple days later my mother confronts me about this, and raises a stink about it. She says she told all of her friends at work (all middle aged women) and they all agreed that it was weird I did not go in with my sister, and tries to cite this as an example of me not caring about people. I try to explain to her that (a) Doctor's Office waiting rooms are disgusting and uncomforatable to wait in (b) She was going straight into the doctors office and coming straight out since we arrived at the scheduled time. If we had to wait an hour I would have gone in with her (c) She is almost 17, and able to do this thing by herself, and did not bat an eye when I said I would wait outside. If she asked me too, I would have come in. (d) It was really nice out, and I would rather finish my coffee in the car. I feel like my mother is always trying to interpret meaning from things I do where there is none. Or maybe I am an asshole, and if thats the case I will apologize.",

I take care of a family member full-time, so that long weekend is my only break out of the entire year and it's super important to me. \n\nLast time I attended with my friend we made an agreement that they would watch for the tickets to go on sale the following year. Well, they never contacted me and the tickets sold out.  It wasn't until several weeks later that I randomly visited the event site and realized everything was sold out.  \n\nI'm not a person who cries easily but realizing my 'treat' wasn't going to happen hit me HARD.  I mean full-out, ugly sobs. My friend didn't seem to get why I was so upset. They said they had been having personal issues and had been depressed, and as a result hadn't personally felt invested in attending the event.\n\nNow, I would have been disappointed but sympathetic if things had ended there.  Then my friend revealed they DID buy tickets for themself and their SO.  So they somehow found the mental fortitude to check the site, get out their credit card, and secure their own trip, but picking up the phone to call me had been just too much to handle.  Even if my friend hadn't been sure if they were attending or not until the last minute, they still could have given me a head-ups so I would have known I needed to keep an eye on the site myself.  Instead they didn't even bother to let me know they had their own ticket until after I brought the subject up. So my friend not only screwed me out of going with them, they screwed me out of going by myself too. \n\nMy friend eventually seemed to realize I was well and truly pissed and offered to buy a second hand ticket.  By then all of the hotels in the area were booked and sharing a room with them wasn't something I wanted to do.  I really just felt like they just didn't want me to attend with them, though they kept insisting that wasn't the case.  \n\nSo am I the asshole for not accepting depression as a reasonable explanation for this?

It just makes me so bitter that he is going out frequently when that is not an option for me because of his back.

    "selftext": "So, this is a really long story. I started working at a pizza place about 9 or 10 months ago, and this really cute girl started working there around the same time as me. I had a crush on her for a while, and then a co worker outed me. She would ask me to buy her things, and then after a while, I realized that it wasn't doing any good, so I stopped being a yes man. She would start getting jealous when girls would flirt with me, or at least, when she thought girls were flirting with me, and then I had enough and told her that I wanted to just be friends with her. She started becoming super sexual towards me, asking me to grab her butt and stuff like that. So, despite my better instincts, I did. A day later, I told her that I shouldn't have done that, and that I still wanted to just be friends with her.\n\nSo, she would do things like grab at my crotch and stuff, and after a while, I began to go after her again. We sexted a few times, and it became a weird sort of semi-relationship.\n\nThen, this one guy who we were friends with got a crush on her. Now, I could be wrong, but in my mind, he thought that he could just move in on her and I'd be pushed to the side. He would say weird things to me, trying to get me to be jealous, and honestly, it worked. He was in the position that I was in when I was a yes man, he'd literally do anything for her. He was basically her personal chauffeur.\n\nI think he really hated me. He was jealous. He was literally doing everything right, and nothing was working, meanwhile I was sort of trying to get out of it (again) and she liked me more than him. So, I was planning on taking two months off, and two days before I was going to leave, he asks me \"Why does it seem like you keep going after her if you say that you want me to be with her?\" or something like that.\n\nSo I explained to him that she's told me she doesn't like you in that way, and that she's gotten mad at me for \"pushing her towards you\". Which is 100% accurate. And I guess I said something like \"She told me that she liked me\". Which isn't true, but for some reason I thought it was. And, while it was technically a lie, it wasn't inaccurate as literally two days before, we were sexting each other.\n\nShe lies to him and tells him that she never said that. I asked her why and she said it was because she didn't want him not to be her friend. He thinks I'm an asshole, so whatever. I work with him one more day, he's makes it clear that he hates me, and I leave.\n\nCut to two weeks later. They both quit, and I still talk with her. One night, a week after I got baptized, she tells me she wants to sext with me. I tell her I don't want to, and I shouldn't, and she convinces me to. Now, let me make it clear, that's my fault, not hers. I don't blame her for that, I do blame her for asking me in the first place when she knows that I don't think I should be doing that.\n\nSo we do, and the next day I tell her that I'm not doing that anymore. She tries to convince me that I didn't do anything wrong, etc. Okay, fine. Then a day after that, I tell her that I'm applying to this grocery store in our area. Here comes the problem.\n\nShe tells me that I can't do that because she's applying there. And that's not insidious in itself, the way she said it is. She said \"You will not apply there\", and the way she said it was the way a parent would say it. So I say \"Fine, I'm not applying there\" and she says \"Good, don't apply there. If you do I'll tell my friends who work there to tell their boss not to hire you.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm livid. I don't know why, but I took stock of our interactions. Groping me when I'm not interested. Begging me to do sexual things with her when I tell her I shouldn't be doing those things. She has utterly no respect for me as a person, and frankly, if she's not willing to work with me two days after she's willing to sexually open herself up to me, she's not someone I'm interested in being friends with.\n\nSo I said \"Well, you know what, I'm applying anyway. Goodbye.\"\n\nAnd I blocked her from all communication access.\n\nThen the dude I talked about earlier texts me, tries to convince me to unblock her, tells me that \"at least I actually care about her feelings\" and all that jazz. He was basically talking himself up to me. So I blocked him, too, not long after he sent me messages that were from her. A screencap of her talking to her friend who works there about how \"So and so is an asshole and nobody likes him\" and then her saying that she's going to \"Make my life hell\".\n\nWell, here I am 2 and half(ish) weeks later, my life isn't hell, and as a matter of fact, I think I'm in a better position.\n\nAm I the asshole? Are they assholes?\n\nFor context, we're 17/18.",

    "selftext": "This story is one that stretches over 15 years..fair warning, I guess. \n\nSo there was this girl, I'll call Eliza.  She and I met when she was 10, and I was 12. We were each others' first, terribly awkward kiss and the best of friends who told each other everything...almost. Throughout the years, as she and I dated other people (neither of us ever date each other, but one of us was always in a relationship when the other was out of one), our respective partners at the time began to realize that we got involved somehow in said relationship. Eliza would often show up at my house or attempt to start up a friendship with whoever I was dating, which my gf would typically say made them uncomfortable. Whenever Eliza was having bf troubles, she would come to me with them, and the bf would often come to me and \"make sure\" there was nothing going on between us. A few of her bfs would say that they felt like the 'other man', and my gfs would echo their sentiments when I dated. \n\nI was 23 when I finally admitted to myself my feelings for her.\n\nA singular issue Eliza and I often butted heads about was the fact that she frequently invited me to hang out with her plus her bf, which was agonizing, if I'm being honest...which I wasn't with her about my feelings. So I would often make up some excuse as to why I couldn't go.\n\nHowever, by that time our intrusions into each others lives were too far gone into toxicity.  In a move I regret to this day, I encouraged her to expose herself to circumstances under which she cheated on her then boyfriend who was about to go into the military (we knew each other well, and I may have been able to prevent it if I hadn't been a douche...her bf was a good guy), and she showed up when my then gf (who suffered from severe bouts of depression and was bipolar) came up from Florida to visit and surprised us by waiting for us at my apartment, when I had expressly told her that my gf was deeply uncomfortable with Eliza in my life.  \n\nWhen I finally confessed my feelings for her, nothing changed. She still invited me to hang out with her and whomever she was dating at the time, and I would often still make up excuses even though I had explicitly told her why I didnt go. I did not expect anything to change between us in favor of affection, and even though I kept a ghost of a hope that we might work out sometime,  she was in a relationship with a good guy that treated her right, and far be it from me to throw drama into the middle of that. \n\nUnforunately, on the night of a party she and her sister we throwing, I had had a good bit to drink, and was planning on crashing there. I was sitting with her, and my memory fails me, here. She said soemthing about her bf, I said something back, and she bluntly stated that she and I would never work out, or something to that effect. Suddenly,  in the middle of a party in which I knew literally one person, I felt utterly alone, and made the utterly stupid decision to drive home buzzed. She tried to stop me, and I tried to explain myself, but things escalated and I left. I got home without hurting anyone by taking back roads and the like, but it was a rash and dangerous decision. \n\nWe met up the day after, talked about it, and then she invited me and my roommate via FB message to hang out with her...and her BF in the mountains for a weekend. I said no. Things escalated. She told me to go ahead and do what I want,  and I said I gladly world.\n\nThat was the last we spoke. \n\nHer friend group (which included her, my roommate, two of her exes, her only female friend), who I DMed for all left her and took my side, though looking back I'm not sure that exactly spoke in my favor. \n\nI'm happily married, now. I live in a house. I was bitter towards her for years until recently, when I sent her a message apologizing for the idiotic things I had done and wishing her well in all things after I watched my wife patch things up honorably with a relative that had done her considerable wrong. \n\nI still have dreams about us talking things over like we used to, but I know it'll never happen. \n\nA long read,  I'm sorry. There are a hundred other things that happened, but none so pivotal as the few incidents mentioned and the slow burn between us for 15 years. \n\nWhat do you think? ",

He walked out--looked directly at the car and went back inside. Mind you, this same car, the same car he calls dibs on every other week to drive when he gets his license.\n\nI thought maybe, just maybe, he didn't recognize the car, it's dark.

Mind you this was a YELLING match. \n\nI told him that what I'm wanting to tell him (that he should actually listen) will help him in his \"game\" not just with girls/women but life in general. Instead of listening, he's constantly yelling and saying \"I don't want your advice! Etc etc etc\".\n\nAfter trying to get a word in edge wise, I responded with \"Fuck it. Get the fuck out the car since you know everything.\" And left him about 5 miles away from the house (in a safe area, city bus applicable area).\n\nAm I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "I got married in August. Right after I got married there were some cuts made at my workplace and I lost my job. Thank God I saved up and was able to not go hungry. I ended up being jobless for about 3 - 1/2 months. During that time my wife told me that we could maybe borrow money from her mother and that she was cool and could let me pay her back in installments. Up to this point I never really had much interaction with my in-laws, but they were pretty neutral about me. I talked to my mother-in-law and she was really nice about it and kept saying things like \"It's all good, we are family now.\"\n\nSidenotes - my wife is currently studying full time and is about to finish up her degree which is why she couldn't help with the inflow of money. Also I have a crappy relationship with my family for other reasons which is why I never asked for money from them.\n\nFast forward to when I started my new job. I start off working 40/w at minimum here in Texas (7.25). I then start getting messages from wife one morning saying that if I had the money to pay her mother back. I obviously didn't because I barely got the new job, plus I was told I could pay with installments. So I tell my wife that and she texts back \"alright.\" So that's that. I get home after work and I noticed that there were a good amount of groceries that were missing even tho I had some groceries the day before. Well, it turns out that my wife's mother wanted to make a buffet or something that day and needed groceries, so she visited my wife and took everything that she needed from US!\nMy next reaction was \"Well, why the hell did you let her take it?!\" And my wife started crying and telling me that her mother needed the money she let us borrow at that precise moment to buy groceries and since we couldn't pay her back she was going to take our groceries. That is just crazy but she helped us when we needed it so I let it slide. But ever since that day every time that lady needs something she pretty much harasses us into doing it by \"asking for favors\". Ex. Taking her to the airport in Mexico (we live in the border), taking her younger kids to school, walk into our apartment whenever she wants, tutor the kids, etc. And now there is no schedule for payments, whenever she wants/needs the money she calls us until we answer to ask for a payment. \nBut here is the kicker! not only do we do every little thing she asks, every time we see her she reminds us of that money that she let us borrow. With mothers Day approaching my wife has a whole day a festivity in mind to spend with her mother, but I don't want to hang out with her family. I always leave those family meetings upset, because of every thing that they say. even one time I was explaining that we needed a set day for the payments, because I have other payments too and my mother-in-law said \"Well, if you hadn't lost your job for being lazy, you wouldn't have needed a loan in the first place.\" I have the shittiest relationship with my family, but I would rather 1000% more spend it with them that with my mother-in-law.\n\nMy wife loooooooves her family to death and wants to hang out with them as much as she can and I am now \"part of their family\" but I feel like a slave when I am around that family.

To. The. God. Damn. Letter.\n\nnow. after a nice apology, Stacy has gotten into contact with me. She had never actually seen the list of \"damages\" sent to me by james, and agrees on the ridiculousness of it.\nand it appears that jenny and james have lied about moving out to get the others to leave, so they could move in more of jenny's friends hassle free.

    "selftext": "My parents own a house in my college town where all my siblings and I have lived while we attended college. We add up the utilities and cost of the mortgage, taxes, and insurance and then divide by 3, and that's how much each person pays for rent. The utilities has always been paid as a (slightly elevated) flat rate based off the average payment cost the previous year, for convenience sake. My roommates give me money, I give it to my parents, they pay all the bills. \n\nIt's never been written down anywhere what those utilities are, I just keep a spreadsheet and have for several years. \n\nI've paid for internet out of pocket the past year. I decided I wanted to upgrade to a faster speed. Since it's been my luxury, I stopped including it in utilities and just paid for it myself. Yard work is the only other utility that's on my dime (neither on my parents or on the rent). \n\nSince I've got an internship out of town for the summer, I'm not going to pay for it. It's $70/month for the high speed that supports several devices streaming for all of us. They can pick a cheaper rate for just them. One of them is apparently going to be gone and paying rent for a room she's not using since she couldn't find a sublease, so she's getting an extra fee for a service she's not gonna use either. So it'll just be one roommate paying for her own internet I think. \n\nIt sounds fair to me but they don't think it is because they were never informed of the fact their rent didn't go towards internet anymore since there's no list of utilities, and there was never any net change to what they pay me (around the same time I started paying for internet as a utility myself, the price of electricity in the city went up and I had to pay for preventative termite treatments). I still have the fact that internet has been on my credit card &amp; not my parents and blah blah, so in the end I can prove everything I'm doing. \n\nThey just feel like the rug got swept out from underneath them and that it's a dick move over a couple hundred bucks.

But try as I like to ignore these so called trivial issues I can't help but either speak up and receive flak or let it stew and breed passive aggression. an example for context, my friend and I were talking at around 7 am , we talked about a bunch of stuff but decided \" hey wana play some games later? \" I mean he asked me and I haven't had time to play for ages so obviously I say yes. he says he's home at around 6-7 I say \"rad, lemme know when you're ready \" so I chill, get some stuff done, then hop on and practice a bit since im rusty, then he gets online around 8, only he says he's playing with another group of people. \"alright lemme know when you guys are done\" .... this keeps me waiting maybe an hour or two .... then he finally hops on the game we are going to play, heck yeah .... except he's playing it solo ... not heck yeah, so, this is where I feel I become the asshole, rage comes outta know where when this stuff happens, and I either have to confront nicely or stew passive aggressively, I confronted him saying \"why play alone? you aren't playing with the others why not invite me, this irks me pretty bad dude\" but he assures me I'm wrong to feel the way I do and basically mocks me trying to express how I feel (he might also be the a hole me thinks). so two questions really, AITA ? and if so, what the heckin heck do I do, everytime I start thinking I might be the asshole here all I can do is feel incredibly down.",

    "selftext": "AITA for being pissed that my(40f) husband(45m) and teenage son (16) did not acknowledge mother's day? \n\nA little backstory- married 20+ years, our teenage son lives at home, and our 6yo daughter was killed in an accident a few years ago. So needless to say, mother's day is kind of hard for me. \n\nSo, husband and I get up in the morning, no acknowledgement whatsoever of mother's day. No \"Happy Mother's Day\". Literally all I wanted to hear.  I think maybe husband is just waiting for son to get up. Cool, whatever. Son gets up. Again, nothing from his mouth either. Then, the three of us talk about going to my MIL's house to take her HER MOTHER'S DAY present. So, at this point I know that they both know it is mother's day.\n\nOn the way to MIL's, we stop by the store so I can go in and get a gift bag for her gift. So, at this point, my husband has access to a store. Just saying. Go to MIL's, and I actually said that I had not gotten a \"Happy Mother's Day\" from either one of them, IN FRONT OF MY SON. Hey said he had to get to work. Ok. Thanks dude. \n\nHusband was counting on sex last night. Him and I get in the car to leave MIL's, told him it wasn't going to happen because I was pissed. And told him why I was pissed, becuase neither one of them had said \"Happy Mother's Day\". Honestly, that was all I wanted. A card would be the cherry on top. \n\nActually, until the last year or two, husband used to be pretty good about acknowledging MD and my birthday. \nBut, last fall, on my 40th birthday, husband did nothing. (It's in my comment history.) Seriously hurt my feelings, and I made sure he knew it. So you would think he would at least try. \n\nBut, as the final piece to this little puzzle, I honestly don't know whether I'm overreacting or not. (For the record, I haven't yelled or anything. Said my peace and haven't talked to husband since.) I ran out of my anti-deppresent last week because I forgot to get my refill in time, but I should receive it today. So my emotions are all over the place anyways, and I straight-up bawled for hours last night.\n\n (I couldn't even call my own mom to tell her HMD, texted her a little stretch of the truth and told her I would talk to her today.\n\nFinal note: found a MD card in my purse this morning saying he (husband) had this card, but he was waiting to give it to me, but then \"I decided to hate him\" so he couldn't. I know what kind of cards he usually buys. This was not it. This was one of the last ones on the rack (because I was there hours before and they were pretty much all gone). He grabbed it when he ran out to get himself McDonalds earlier. It seriously isn't the point of the actual card. Still have not the words \"Happy Mother's Day\". Am i being an asshole?",

    "selftext": "I am a gamer and my latest gaming obsession is NHL 17.  Several of my friends and acquaintances also play with me, daily.  As a group we pit ourselves against other groups of players and, more often than not, we lose.  I do not like losing and when the less experience players make a mistake, I use that for positively-framed teaching moments.  The game is hard and it takes practice, so patience and dedication is required to be competitive.\n\nHowever, the other players do not take the game as seriously as I do.  I play with an intense, singular focus. The rest of them, varying degrees of not so much.  And when I see one of them make a mistake, again and again, after learning how to avoid the mistake, positively-framed teaching moments take a back seat to immediate and unfiltered criticism.  Nothing abusive of course, no name calling, just a \"you're fucking up, fix it.\"\n\nTwo exchanges come to mind where I feel *may* be in the wrong:\n\n1.  My brother (relationship is relevant because familial relationships come with historical context), when he makes mistakes, is a \"the game is cheating!\" kind of person.  After I make a mistake in a recent game, he mockingly parrots back a criticism I have levied against him.  I go *ad hominem* and respond with something to the effect of, \"coming from a person who blames the computer for every mistake he makes, you don't have any right to criticize anyone.\"\n\nTo his credit, after that he has stopped blaming the computer and owns his mistakes.  This actually makes me really happy, because this is a learned behavior from our less that ideal male role models growing up.  Anyway, AITA?\n\n2.  Myself and another player are in a game while two others, not in the game, are having a conversation; they are attempting to engage the other player in this conversation. I boot them from the party and lock it down.  I feel extraneous conversation is distracting.  After the game I joined up with them and apologized, as I obviously should, and explained why.  But not before they (rightfully) booted me to give me a taste of my own medicine.  Turnabout is fair play and we all had a laugh over it afterwards.\n\nFast forward to last night...\n\nSame situation.  Me and another player are in a game.  The same acquaintances are having a side conversation in the party.  One suggests they move to another party.  The other acquaintance says \"nah I just muted them\" apparently joking which I did not pick up.  I say \"if you're going to mute us please go to another party so we don't have to take the time to mute you two.\"\n\nThis set acquaintance 1 off.  He tells me I am an asshole for getting on people's case.  That this is a game, not something serious like work, and that if he was with me right now he would kick my ass.\n\nI tell him I may have misaligned priorities, but it's none of his business what I care about or how much I care.  And if he did try to kick my ass over this he would be even more wrong than he already is.  He unfriends me and tells me never to contact him ever again.  After an hour or so I text him, apologizing for behaving like an asshole.  Which he accepts, and apologizes for his behavior as well.\n\nWho is the asshole here?\n\nEdit:. Thanks everyone.  I'm inclined to believe I am the asshole.  Glad I apologized.",

I honestly do love her very much, and I can't imagine being with anyone else.\n\nThere is one thing, though. I am way more active than she is. I always want to go to shows, go out drinking and go to different events, and she's always tired. I can get her to come out once or twice but if it's two weekends in succession she won't come out. I'm basically going out with a cat. An adorable cat that I can't help fawning over, but is kind of a pain to convince her to be active. I do understand that in relationships you recognise the good and bad in your other half so I don't resent her for not having as much energy as me, not one bit. It's just how she is, and I'm ok with that.  \n\nHowever, it has an adverse effect on me. I used to be able to get her to come out a lot more, but after a chat I knew she felt I was dragging her all over the place, so I started to go out on my own. When she was in another country for study, she got mad at me for hanging out with a bunch of girls (it's complicated. I put a message up in a group chat and only girls responded and I was in a position where I couldn't call it off.) Just for some drinks and a chat. I can understand that, and learnt my lesson about that. After a while, things settled down and she seemed to be more comfortable with me going out on my own. I became a bit more vocal about it, and she doesnt seem stressed. But all this time I've had a little voice in the back of my mind nagging me that I'm leaving her out. I find myself feeling guilty for not bringing my girlfriend along to social occasions or events, because I'd know shed have fun. \n\nToday, the line up for this small festival go released and I told my girlfriend I read wanted to go. Last year we went it was only two days but this year it's three. I told her that I had a lot of fun last year and I want to go for the whole thing this year, and she said that last year after two days she was exhausted, and the food was really expensive. She's also not that into music as much as I am, I do freelance work in the industry and run a community. So I suggested that I get the tickets for the whole weekend and I'll get two day tickets for her, she discovered that there arent two day tickets, only one day and the whole weekend. So she said she'll get the whole weekend ticket as well. Bringing into account the stuff she said about last year and our difference in enthusiasm levels towards music, i felt really guilty about it. But if I say \"its ok dont come then\" it night guilt trip her or come across wrong. So...I just don't know what to do now.\n\nSo I guess this isnt solely an AITA. \n\nIt's an AITA for going to more events than her, and a kind of \"what should I do\" in the future about these feelings.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "This incident happened a while ago, but it's bothered me since it happened. I'm a yoga instructor, and last year I had a girl who attended my classes fairly regularly. She was a good student who listened well, and it was clear she was pushing herself each class. However, she never showed any interest in me - she never stayed after class to talk to me, never got to know me on any level, etc. I got the impression that she just wanted to work out and nothing else. I didn't even know her name.\n\nThen one day, I matched with her on Tinder, not recognizing her because she had makeup on in her pictures, as opposed to in person. I talked to her a bit online, and decided to ask her out in person, but the next time I saw her, she left as soon as class was over, not even giving me a chance to ask her out. A week later, she wound up being the only student in the class. I asked her out afterwards, she said yes, and we set up a date. She cancelled on me the first time, but rescheduled for the next night.\n\nIt wound up being one of the worst dates I have ever had. She looked visibly nervous, and conversations felt like they were going nowhere. She rarely commented on anything, never had anything to add to the conversation, and the whole time I felt like I was talking to a wall. Eventually, to try and get her to talk more, I started asking more questions, which led to this exchange:\n\n\n\"Have you seen any good movies lately?\"\n\n\"No, I don't really go to movies.\"\n\n\"Any TV shows you have been watching?\"\n\n\"No, I don't really watch TV.\"\n\n\"Any books you like?\"\n\n\"I don't read much.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you like to do for fun, then?\"\n\n\"Aside from yoga, I don't really have hobbies.\"\n\n\nShe absolutely refused to open up to me. And yet, I still tried, because I've said stupid things on dates before. People tell me I'm judgmental and need to be optimistic, so I asked her out again, hoping she might relax a little bit. Instead, she kept making excuses, and claimed she was busy or would just refuse to respond to my texts.\n\nEventually, I had had enough. I asked her to stop coming to my classes. I felt like my emotions had been toyed with, how I had opened up to this girl and gotten absolutely nothing in return. I felt like I had been lied to, because she was attracted to me but did literally nothing to indicate so, forcing me to do all the work. The whole experience was so miserable that I couldn't stand to even look at her. It's become my go-to story when I'm trying to explain to someone how painful dating is.\n\nShe didn't respond to my last texts, but she stopped coming to my classes. I knew she was still at the gym, because she went to the class before mine, but we never spoke or even made eye contact. I never heard anything from management, so she must not have submitted a complaint, which is good. There was no incident - the whole thing stayed between the two of us.\n\nI'm probably an asshole on some level because I'm denying her a yoga class that should come with her gym membership, but was my response justified here? Or should I have been able to put my feelings aside and let her keep attending my classes?",

    "selftext": "**Overview:** I (26 y.o.) am married and have a 3 y.o. boy (fake name Timmy). My parents (live nearby) took in a guy who used to bully me when we were teenagers and he (28 y.o., fake name Chad) still lives with them. They have considered him their own kid ever since his mother killed herself in 2012, since his dad is remarried (but just got Chad a job where he works, so they're on good terms) and his stepfather remarried as well. They treat my need to improve my life as a flaw, but defend him with every fiber of their being. He has lost his temper at someone practically every day that I've seen him. In January, that was Timmy. Chad got mad at Timmy for playing with his face (not hitting or pinching, just being a goofball), so he spanked Timmy in front of the whole family. After months of counseling with me, my wife and my parents, they decided that they will never get rid of Chad (Because he's family now) and that all my issues with them (see clarifications below) are \"important\", *BUT they were doing their best, so there's nothing they can do about it.* I haven't seen them in a month, and obviously neither has Timmy. My younger sister is getting married next month and I told her we'll be there for the ceremony but not the reception and photos, because I can't pretend to be okay around my parents and Chad.\n\n#Clarifications:\n\n**Me &amp; My Parents:** They believe we\u2019ve always had a great relationship, but growing up they always told me to be happy no matter what. I was getting bullied at school, and they\u2019d tell me it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, or I was making it up, or that I need to think about how the bully feels. Maybe *the bullies* have troubles at home. (Gee, I wonder what that\u2019s like!) So I learned to bury emotion and smile, because that\u2019s what made them happy. They thought we were close, but I\u2019ve been faking since I was 7 or 8 because I was convinced that that\u2019s what they wanted. I was convinced that my feelings are inconvenient and unimportant, but my *parents* actually matter, so I should just make them happy. We had a relationship that seemed perfect on the surface, but I always craved an actual, meaningful connection with them. I tried confronting my mom about things in 2007 (specifically using examples of times I needed their help and they shut me down and shamed me instead), and she told me I was making things up to spite her and she made me apologize to her for even bringing that stuff up. In the years that followed, I tried to voice concerns about crappy people in our lives (each of which ended up causing problems), but they don\u2019t want to see bad in anyone ever, so they told me I was wrong or shouldn\u2019t judge. But when I got married and my wife was struggling with depression (which has now been under control for 3 years with doctors, sertraline and a **genuinely solid marriage between us**), they told me repeatedly to leave her.\n\n-\n\n**Chad:** We met in Junior High and he was condescending and dominating, but he was willing to come around, liked the same stuff (Bionicle, DBZ, etc.) and I had no self-esteem, so I started hanging out with him. Every time we did anything, we\u2019d do what he wanted and he\u2019d shoot down my ideas. His older brother treated him pretty badly, so I guess he was taking it all out on me. But it was better than being alone. My parents only saw a nice friendship, somehow. In 2009, his stepmom kicked him out of his dad\u2019s house and his stepdad kicked him out of his mom\u2019s house. Before that, he had been living in an apartment with 5 other roommates, 4 of which had no jobs so they mooched off Chad, who was working 2 fast food jobs. I invite Chad to stay at my parents\u2019 house (I was away at college) for a few weeks until he got back on his feet. He stayed there for WAY longer than that. He moved out about a year later, then his older brother committed suicide out of nowhere in 2011. Chad moved back in with his mom. At the end of 2011, I was still firmly believing that my feelings don\u2019t matter and I need to take care of everyone else, because that\u2019s how I was raised, and I had gotten really good at taking care of everyone's needs but mine. I invited Chad to live with me and my roommates, as we had an open spot in our apartment. He did. 2 months later, his mother killed herself, having never stopped grieving the death of her other son. Chad\u2019s bipolar disorder started to show more and more. He destroyed his laptop, his phone, gaming consoles/controllers, punched a hole in the wall, etc. My mom convinced me to take him and go do summer sales together in a different state. While we\u2019re out there, he freaked out multiple times and I started to be afraid for my safety. We drove out there in his car (which my parents helped him get, but never bothered to even discuss a car with me after I moved out), so I flew home early. He came back shortly thereafter and moved back in with our roommates (neither of us sold our contracts when we left for the summer). In 2013, I met, dated and married my wife. Chad couldn\u2019t stand her and openly made fun of her. (I'm assuming he felt threatened by someone else entering the family that he was so comfy in, but I can't be sure) While dating, we stopped going to my apartment because if he found both of us there, he\u2019d awkwardly sit in the room with us just to assert his position in our living room, he would stomp off like a toddler having a temper tantrum, yell and scream in his room, or he\u2019d throw dishes and food across the room where we were. We started hanging out at my parents\u2019 house a bit more (20 minutes away), and Chad started showing up while we\u2019d be there. Normally, he'd act vaguely grumpy and then leave. In the years that followed, we voiced our concerns with Chad (amongst other toxic strays my parents took in) to my parents, and they just wouldn\u2019t see any of his negative traits as being that big of a deal. They saw someone in need of their help. They were (and still are) convinced that they ***can*** and ***must*** help him. He later moved back in with my parents, and has stayed there until the present day. Since then, my parents have been ***emphatic*** that they have had regular talks with him and are trying to help him get on his feet. They claim he is trying out different counselors so he can find one he likes. *They genuinely seem to believe that he is improving, and it's clear that they really care about him. The relationship that I have seen them have is the one I was always so desperate for.* So, my wife and I tried our hardest to just accept that he\u2019s \u201cpart of the family\u201d and we put **exhaustive** effort into building a relationship with him. But in every conversation or interaction, he just complained and whined about anything he could think of. We decided to be pleasant around him still, but we stopped putting in as much effort, as it physically and mentally drained us just to try to be okay with him. This continued until when he spanked Timmy. The next day, we confronted him in front of my mother, and explained that he will not be allowed to see Timmy, because Timmy shouldn\u2019t have to be told \u201cOh don\u2019t go touch him, it\u2019s not safe\u201d. My wife, admittedly, ranted at him for a while. Chad told my wife she was done talking and tried to start his piece. My wife didn't take that well. He rolled his eyes and stormed off, claiming that he\u2019ll move out. (That never happened) My mother understood our concern for Timmy\u2019s safety, but thought we still should have been kinder and more understanding. She was upset with us for **telling** Chad what was going to happen instead of having an **open, loving conversation** with someone I can only see as having been an abuser ever since I met him.\n\n-\n\n**Counseling:** I saw a counselor individually, and another with my wife and parents. At first, the resolution was reached that my parents would make sure Chad is out of the house whenever we are going to be there. This \"worked\" for a short amount of time, but Chad's items were still there in the house, reminding me that he is welcome by my parents. It made me miserable that I had to involve Chad in our decision making process whenever we wanted to take Timmy to Grandma and Grampa's house. We could no longer turn up out of the blue. Their attachment to Chad restricted my ability to see my family. **I became less upset at Chad (who in my eyes is just a remorseless opportunist who comes from a crappy background) and more frustrated with my parents (who have still never taken me seriously when I need their help with an issue they don't want to address).** *It's important to note that they have always been eager to help with happy things, like DIY projects, babysitting or job searches, but they have tended to make me feel like I'M the problem when I bring up a topic they don't like, even if I'm suffering because of it.* In later meetings, I explained that if Chad is living at their house (or considered part of the family), I can't come there at all. It's too painful to see them act all happy like nothing is wrong, while thinking they're doing the right thing harboring someone who's caused me *nothing but pain for 15 years.* I've spent too long faking for THEIR sake, and I'm worn out. They didn't take this well. **They have tried many times to convince me that we have always had a great relationship. They are convinced that I'm somehow wrong about the way I've felt my entire life. Not only is it arrogant, it's completely demeaning.** Subsequent meetings were generally fruitless, as my parents came back at everything with \u201cwe\u2019re trying\u201d or \u201cwe were doing the best we could\u201d and wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for anything. They claim that they don\u2019t really remember the first 10 years of my life, while simultaneously telling me I\u2019m remembering things incorrectly from that time period. On the final meeting, they finally admitted that they did not listen to me growing up, and if they HAD listened, Chad would not be in the family, I wouldn\u2019t have struggled with bullies for my entire public school experience, and we\u2019d have a better relationship. But despite this confession, they still see no reason to remove Chad from their home since, in their eyes, **he's improving. They say he's been learning to remove himself from the room before he loses his temper.** They talked about how they will miss Timmy and how it would break their hearts for us to not see them anymore, but they still can\u2019t/won't believe most of the things that I say are issues. I told them goodbye.\n\n-\n\n**Aftermath:** Since then, Chad still lives with them and I have not seen my parents. None of my siblings want to remove Chad from the family, despite him losing his temper at each of them various times. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a pet, and I\u2019m telling them that dog has to go. I've talked with each of them, and they claim to understand my side of the story (Chad was always a jerk to me, my wife and child and he has the relationship I always wanted with my parents), but they still don\u2019t think he\u2019s *that* bad. One sister is getting married next month. She asked me if I\u2019ll be in pictures with the family. I re-iterated that mom and dad make me feel worthless and I can\u2019t stand the sight of Chad. My wife feels similarly, but her depression also adds physically arresting panic attacks when forced to be around these people. I explained that I would not miss the ceremony, but I don\u2019t want to introduce that awful atmosphere into her wedding reception, and that I cannot simply pretend to be okay, as that\u2019s what I did for most of my life and I can\u2019t do it anymore. Sister is currently furious with me for \u201cholding on to pride\u201d and \u201cnot letting this go\u201d.\n\n-\n\n#***AITA for wanting Chad removed from my family, and for not wanting to see him or my parents, even at my sister's wedding reception??***\n\nEDIT: Clarified some phrases to ensure accuracy.",

    "selftext": "So I met this girl only a few months ago, when she started working at the same place as me. I didn't really think too much of her until we walked home together from work about two weeks ago, and then ended up hanging out at my house twice, her house twice and went for dinner once (all in the past two weeks). Well yesterday I was on a short local hike with my friends and we hadn't made it very far before she started texting me that her mom (we both still live with our parents) was freaking out at her and she needed to see me right away, she seemed really worried at the time. I decided to walk back the trail that we had taken so far and catch the bus to a park near her house, where I met her and she explained that her mom was angry about not rinsing off a plate before she put it in the dishwasher, and began complaining about her broken fingernail and how much it would cost to fix. In that moment in the park, I realized that I didn't actually really want a relationship (with anybody, not necessarily just her), and that I should probably end this before it got more serious between us. I ended up telling her this and that I didn't want to have a girlfriend at the current time in my life. She definitely didn't take it very well, and went silent for a minute before she started questioning me about why I didn't tell her earlier. I didn't really have a good reason (I do feel like the asshole for this) and just ended up leaving and going home. Other than a few texts back and forth we haven't talked, and it's pretty clear that she's still mad at me.\n\nSome extra details I don't know where to fit in:\n- She just got from a weekend away and I knew she bought me a T-shirt, which I never ended up recieving from her\n- I saw she just posted a brand new pair of mens shoes in my size on a local facebook buy/sell group, that I can only assume were meant to be a gift for me\n- She told me earlier that her last ex (from about a month ago) was crazy and angry at her for seemingly no reason, but told me yesterday that she had actually been trying to come see me at work when she was with him and talking about me towards the end of their relationship (this made me feel bad for this guy)\n\nSo what do you think reddit? I need your help on this one. If I think of anything else that might be important I'll add it in the comments below.\n\nAlso, any advice for what I should do next? We don't go to the same school, except we do work at the same part-time job and I'm worried it will be pretty awkward now to be around her.\n\nThanks so much everyone.",

    "selftext": "About a month and a half ago I broke it off with my partner because she was becoming increasingly passive and complacent in our relationship. I found myself pulling all of the weight and doing a lot for her, while she became increasingly flaky, unavailable, and generally making me a low priority. It was a point of multiple arguments throughout the latter months of our time together. Her side was always that she wanted to be with me but felt as though she met me to soon after her last relationship, which was abusive and volatile (about a month), so a relationship was too much pressure too soon, and she wished she had more time to be alone before meeting me. (About 3 months into us seeing each other I essentially told her that either she was all in, or I had to go, and I later learned that she took that as pressuring and manipulative. I'll let you guys dissect that one. I also responded to these concerns on multiple occasions by backing off and giving her more space, but she didn't like that either. It was very confusing. Her major fear was labeling things in any way, because it built some series of standards in her head that she felt she had to meet all of a sudden.) I told her I was sorry I pressured her into a relationship as she felt, she told me she was sorry for treating me poorly, and we ended it amicably. We also communicated that neither of us planned on seeing other people for the time being. My reason being that I still cared a lot about her but needed to be away from it for a while, and hers being that she needed more time to be uninvolved with anyone while she got her life back on track after her last shitty relationship. The night we broke up, she asked if I was going to cut her out, and I said not at all, but that we shouldn't speak for a little bit. We ended things amicably.\n\nA week later, I call her to get in back in touch, and I'm met with coldness. She is mad that I didn't speak to her, even though we agreed to not speak. I try to reason with her that this was what agreed on, but her coldness continues. Finally I ask that we meet up and discuss this disconnect in person. She tells me that she is also mad because she thinks I broke up with her to make her come crawling back, her reasoning being that I wouldn't have gotten back in touch with her if that weren't the case. I'm incredibly confused at this point, because, again, staying in touch was something I thought we agreed on. She was mad that I didn't talk to her, but also mad that I talked to her. Eventually I reason her out of this way of thinking. During this discussion we also reiterate that we are not planning on seeing other people, and discuss the vague possibility of trying things again down the road at a better time. We continue communication at a minimal level for the continuing weeks. Communication consists of her sending me things that made her think of me, music recommendations and general small talk with one or two mutual \"I miss you\"s speckled about.\n\nFast forward to a week ago (three weeks after prior discussion), where I discovered, against what she had me believe, that she's been involved with someone else, the capacity to which I am uncertain. All I know is that they met shortly after we broke up. To me, this negated all of her excuses for why she treated me poorly (needing time alone etc), and I felt used, lied to, and strung along, after a relationship where I did all of the work. So I kind of snapped. I contacted her, told her how I felt, and finished off with a \"fuck you\". She replied by saying I was the one who broke up with her, and she didn't have to tell me her business anymore. To me, this missed the point completely, and my patience was so tried at this point that I didn't even reply. We haven't spoken since, and I don't see us ever speaking again.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her off, even though I technically ended it and we are both technically free to see whomever? Or is she the asshole for misleading me, acting in confusing and self-contradictory ways, and making me think the way she treated me was ultimately my fault? I thought we had an understanding and I feel shitty and confused.",

I understand this. Unfortunately, this also means that he doesn't wear deodorant.\n\nI don't know if he can smell himself but I can and sometimes his odor is pretty potent. He had a big launch event for a company that he works for two months ago and when I arrived to this big event where he was networking, he reeked. REEKED. He is very sensitive and gets very upset when I bring up issues. I can't tell if he is simply hard on himself or if he is being purposefully or inadvertently manipulative so that I stop bringing things up. For instance, me making a simple request turns into him having a meltdown about being the him being the most terrible person ever. \n\nSo I attempted to approach the stinky issue very delicately. He was training for a bike trip and decided to start biking to work. I suggested that he maybe start wearing deodorant so as not to offend people with his odor when he arrives to work after the workout and throughout the day. He was VERY upset by my suggestion. I clarified that I am not suggesting this out of malice but mostly out of a pursuit for professionalism and out of concern for him. He eventually took my comment as it was intended. Since that time we purchased some natural deodorant. I've experimented with it myself and it works pretty well but I'd noticed that boyfriend hadn't used it. The other day after we'd both showered I offered him some and he put it on. I even remarked at how good it smelled on him and how much I liked it.\n\nWell, a few days later, I guess he skipped a shower for a day. His boss is a little...hipstery and takes pride in only showering once every two weeks. Somehow, that works for his boss as he doesn't seem to smell. On a day where my boyfriend was kind of stinky his boss made the comment that it was getting hotter and that maybe they'd both need to start taking more frequent showers. My boyfriend laughed about this but I was really mortified for him.\n\nTonight after his shower I again offered him some deodorant. He had already been kind of crabby and we'd been bickering a bit. He made the sarcastic comment that he's sorry that he's not hygienic enough for me. And I got pretty frustrated. I told him that I shouldn't have to walk on eggshells to communicate with him. And that it shouldn't take HIS BOSS telling him that he stinks to do something about it when I tried to help him out with that a few months ago.\n\nHe said that I was cruel for using something that he shared with me against him.\n\nUgh. Can't win.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

We had been together for 7 months and planned on moving cross country together this week. \n\nFor a few reasons, I was hesitant about moving with him. The main one was that he is fiscally irresponsible. In my last year, I had a full load of courses in two fields as well as 3 jobs (two laboratory jobs, one mentoring job). He had a total of 15 hours of work (unpaid internship for his master's) per week and 0 outside work. He did not take it upon himself to get another job or three like I did, and as such I ended up paying for his last semester of school because he couldn't get approved for a loan and wouldn't graduate without that. I would also have to buy him a car in our new home, and pay for all of the apartment expenses by myself until he could contribute. I feel like I'm a 21 year old mom of a 25 year old child who isn't working for himself. \n\nAside from the financial fiasco, I feel like we had some general incompatibility issues. He has few hobbies and lacks ambition to try new things. I'm super motivated to do things and try things and whatnot, and whenever I've tried to get him to do things with me or work hard, he accuses me of nagging. It is discouraging to say the least, and I've found myself staying in to play video games with him more and more which makes me feel kind of cooped up and depressed. He also has very little experience with relationships, and I've had to take on a sort of \"teacher\" role with him on even the most basic aspects of being in a relationship. We have talked about this stuff a little bit. Like I said he accuses me of nagging for the first bit, then the last half isn't his fault as the only way to learn is through experience. I just don't like having to teach him how to romance me. \n\nSo, today I broke up with him. I know he was blindsided as I didn't really give much notice that I was unhappy in the relationship. I was as honest and nice as possible, but firm in my decision. Am I the asshole for not wanting to keep trying/give him more notice on breaking up? ",

    "selftext": "This is kind of complicated. \n\nSo our apartment rental period is coming to an end. Me and two other guys. Over the years, I had become frustrated with their carelessness / laziness in the house. Stuff like leaving the bathroom super messy, leaving the kitchen super messy, leaving food out, general untidiness, etc. \nIt got to the point that I just gave up with the housework and only tidied my room, I couldn't be bothered being the only one to clean up the living room, kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI had moved out entirely like, 2 weeks before the move out deadline. In our \"moving out agreement\" from the letting agent, it stated that we could leave some furniture behind for the landlord to sell, but upon actually visiting the letting agent's office a week before the moving out day I learned that the clause isn't exactly what it says, it means that anything the landlord deems to be sellable (i.e. pristine condition) can be accepted to be left behind, if it is not, then he contract a mover to get rid of it and pass the fee to us. In a panic, I quickly took the advice of the letting agent of contacting a contractor to get rid of our bed frames, fridge, shoe cabinet, coffee table etc. and to throw out rubbish as well.\n\nAt this point, one of my housemates had managed to come back from his business trip, partially move some of his stuff and then go on vacation for some reason. The other guy was packing his stuff up. The vacation guy told us that in a few days his parents would come in and help him with the other stuff that is left. On the day the contractor comes, I ask for a quote and they tell me that the sooner they start the better because theres frankly not enough time to get rid of everything and they normally work with that letting agent, so they know what has to be left behind and also that the agent will charge us if everything isn't thrown out in time. I could only get in contact with one housemate at this time, and he tells me that everything in his room can be cleared out, only the stuff in the living room he needs to sort out what stuff to take. With this information I told the contractor to just start dismantling the bed frames, and leave everything in the living room until monday, which is the date my housemate told me they could start throwing stuff away, and I give the contractor my keys. Later in the day, the vacation guy sends a message that he hasn't finished packing up yet and doesn't want anything thrown out from his room. When I was in the apartment, I didn't see anything valuable in his room and thought it was ok for the contractor to just start dismantling the bed frame. I call the contractor in a hurry and tell her to leave everything as is, and they tell me that they found some stuff in his room and put it all on the living room table. Later on in the day the other housemate reports that a coin jar is missing from the living room, and apparently they moved some of his clothes and hes mad. He tells me that he's put his stuff in a corner of the room and doesn't want it to be touched on Monday. I'm not gonna lie, I already don't know how to handle a situation like this. The vacation guy adds it's poor form to just give someone keys to the apartment when there's still stuff to be moved in the house. At this point there are four days left. \n\nI feel guilty and call the contractor to ask about the coin jar. They say they haven't touched it and everythings piled on top of the table for them to pick out, and they haven't thrown anything out yet, only dismantling furniture. \n\nA day later, now three days left until moving out day, I call the contractor and ask again about the coin jar, which they reply they haven't seen it. They also tell me that the agent is pressuring them to get the apartment ready for inspection on moving out day, and if it isn't done then money will be deducted from our deposit, so the contractor gave me a deadline of the next day to take everything out and everything left will be thrown out, otherwise they won't be able to finish the job on time. \n\nThe guy that hasn't gone on vacation tells me that everything of his will be out by the night. I feel sorry about his coin jar and tell him I'll give him some money for it, which he declines. \n\nThe next day, now two days left until moving out day, the vacation guy complains and says that if he knew everything would've been thrown out he would've made an effort to move everything. I tell him that I was only told everything would need to be thrown out five days before the moving out day and was being pressured already, and I already told them that at the time. I told them also that I did what I felt was necessary, and if it was left up until today (two days before moving out) there was no way it will all get done in time and we would have to have our deposit deducted. I get no response.\n\nThe next day, which is the day before moving out day, the letting agent messages me to say that the contract caught the vacation guy's parents trying to move some of the landlord's appliances and told them to put it back. The letting agent wasn't sure if the contract made it clear which appliances were the landlord's so they told me to tell the housemates (they don't have good communication with the letting agent, only I do) to put anything back that's been taken. At this point, I'm thinking there's no way they could have taken anything because the vacation guy would know which appliances are the landlords, so the only logical conclusion was that the vacation guy was not there. When I got to this conclusion, I was absolutely fuming that he would tell his parents to pick his shit up for him and not be present himself and instead rather be on vacation. A close friend tells me it's none of my business and I should calm down, so I do. I send a message to the vacation guy and tell him that if his parents have taken anything or are going back to take anything, put it back or don't go back. I get no reply, he doesn't pick up the phone, VoIP call, facebook, nothing, so I assume he's still on vacation, the day before moving out day. \n\n\nI will admit that I made a mistake in giving the contractor keys to the apartment while there was still possessions in the house, but if I left it up until later then there wouldn't be any time for the furniture to be moved out and the apartment to be cleaned as well. I just didn't know what to do and made a snap decision, trying to save our security deposit. So Am I The Asshole and what should I have done? Or how could I handle a situation like this in the future? \n\n\nUpdate: Today is the day of moving out. The letting agent called me to ask why the other two hasn't dropped their keys off at their office. I contacted not-vacation guy and he's at work, so he can't do it. However, he's moved all his stuff out. I told him to complain that the contractor they suggested has stole an item, and that I would be doing it too. The agent also tells me that yesterday, while vacation guy's parents were in the flat and the contractor was there too, the parents told the contractor that they want all the stuff on the table, so the contractor has left it alone until today. The contractor has been to the flat and apparently the stuff is still there, so they are unable to move the furniture out. I have tried to facebook message, voip, text and call the vacation guy with no response. I'm pretty mad but it's out of my hands. ",

    "selftext": "Ok so quite alot of context is needed for this. My girlfriends one of them typical young age smokers (been smoking since she was 14) so already there is that hypocrisy thing going on. (Im 19, shes 18). Now i do understand she cares for me alot. Like so much its almost annoying haha. But this is the thing. Now i struggle with mental health and have done since the age of 12, Ive had my suicidal times and on top of that i find it extremely hard to contain my anger. When my head gets bad, which is often i become a completely different person. I get extremely snappy and say things in anger and even (NEVER TO MY GIRLFRIEND I MUST STRESS, ID NEVER LAY A HAND ON HER) become prone to fighting. Yes, my girlfriend helps however not often enough. Which is purly because of my mental health. \n\nNow during a show at college of which i had lead part, i played a boy called William in a show called \"punk rock\" (look it up its a great play) which deals with mental health and during which i had like a mini mental breakdown and since then (been a year now) i havnt been able to get back on stage or even continue my college course. Back to my anger, i have much to be angry about. I had a reject alcoholic father, an alcoholic mother who failed in almost every way to be a parent. I got a way out into two family friends whom i thought to be loving.  If i piss em off even just a little (which is never intentional and often im innocent but thats an entirely different story) i get death threats and all that. My own mental health which i struggle with in so many fucking ways. A college tutor who understands nothing. And literally so much more but if i was to type it, itd lose the point of the post and it just isnt relevant. Point is i have much to be angry about. \n\nSo far then, i struggle with mental health. I have gone from a shitty parent to even shittier. I had a breakdown which continues to hold me back. And my girlfriend can only help so much. I realised cigarettes actually take all my anger out of me. This stops me completely fucking up my relationship. It also calms my head down considerably. \n\nNow, this is where it gets even more of a pisstake. She has no problem buying backy for her underage friends. Giving fags to people who dont smoke (twice) and even when in in absolute tears, and hurting so much shell only reluctantly allow me a single toke. Which of course does nothing. A few times ive smoked and she found out and it nearly ended my relationship. I could be suicidal and still not allowed one which i know would help. \n\nDoesnt end here. I have finally managed to compromise for a vape. Althought nowhere near as helpful im greatfull its something. However she treats it like its \"ours\" (its not, was given by a friend for me for my head. She has fags) and she can again, use it whenever she wants. I cant. If i do she gets once again, very shitty. \n\nSo am i the asshole for getting extremely frustrated because i cant have a fag to help me calm down no matter how bad i am (shes even seen me in absolute tears till she reluctanlty gave in and wasnt happy about it) but she can give fags to underage friends who she also cares about, and fags to people that dont smoke?\n\nEdit: Sorry quite important. Ive never smoked before. I just found out it helps\n\nConclusion: I am the asshole, sorry baby girl :/ thankyou everyone i now have some making up to do \n(Mobile isnt letting me flair)",

    "selftext": "About a year ago I became fwb with a girl who lives five blocks away from me, we'll call her Willow. Willow isn't all there. She has terrible depression, social anxiety, and what we both thought was undiagnosed asburgers syndrome. After a few weeks Willow told me that she loved me one night in bed. I pretended to be asleep.\n\nThat summer I started working at a Renaissance Faire. It wasn't really my speed. The Faire was held at a park two hours away from my parents suburban house, but as I'm a 20 somethin' struggling actor I decided the gig might give me some needed experience. One day on the long drive to a rehearsal I was stuck in traffic behind a terrible car accident. When I finally saw the crash it was my exact make and model car, same color and everything, but only half the car was recognizable as a 16 wheeler crashed into it.\n\nWhen I got to the ren Faire I immediately got on the phone to Willow. I told her I was quitting the ren fair because life was too short to die on my way to ren fair, and I told her that I loved her, probably out of fear or the adrenaline of thinking about death...\n\nAs I went to my director to tell him I was going to quit he offered me a higher paying position to work with children, two things I love, children and money.\n\nSo I forgot about quitting and I continued for several weeks to work at the ren Faire.\nWhen the rehearsals were over and the Faire started I met a stage manager named... we'll call her Carrie. I was really happy to talk to her and she was one of the few friends I had there.\n\nBecause it was the ren Faire and we were all sleeping in tents we never looked our best, so I never saw Carrie as anything more than a friend. One night while we were drinking by the fire (what else is there to do at a ren Faire off hours?) she was showing me pictures on her insta, she swiped past a stunning mirror picture of her in a sexy black dress that framed her slender figure, without giving it any thought I just let out \"Dayumn!\" I was so embarrassed, but I realized she was absolutely gorgeous, and I could never unsee it. Then she showed me pictures of her military boy friend who was stationed over seas.\n\nBecause I wasn't an asshole at that time... I still saw Carrie as just a friend. The last night of ren Faire, four of us went to a diner, we got soup and coffee and hot cocoa because it was really cold that night. Carrie excused herself to the bathroom. A few minutes later another friend at the table pointed out to me that I kept looking at the bathroom, and they all reckoned I had a crush on Carrie. I fought them on it, when Carrie got back we started talking about how we would all miss each other. Everyone always says stuff like this at the end of an acting gig. I've always distanced myself from it. Everyone at the table cried into their coffees... but my hot cocoa stayed dry. That is, I didn't cry into it.\nWe all got in our cars and went our seperte ways. I reflected on my time at the Faire on my two hour drive...and my brain just kept going back to Carrie. Every time I saw Carrie walking up the hill to my area. The times before faire would start and we would blast music and sing from the tops of our lungs. All the awkward early morning, hung over waiting in line together to go to the communal showers, and the late night drinking... the thought finally hit... \"I'm never going to see her again\". A single tear rolled down my cheek...more started rolling down my face... I pulled over. \"I love Carrie.\" I sat in my car thinking about it. Carrie is the only person who made me not feel alone.\n\nThis revelation got me to call things off with Willow. Not that I was expecting to peruse a girl that lived two hours away from me, but just knowing there is someone out there that I have so much in common with gave me the hope that I could find someone else.\n\nCarrie and I kept in touch, that was common post acting gigs, and usually things would fizzle down. So October came and Carrie was working at a haunted house. She invited me to go, I said sure, then last minute I told her something came up. It was the first of what I thought would be a series of broken promises until we stopped talking to each other (that's normal as well... for me anyway).\n\nSo December came. I was taking improv classes in the city an hour and a half from me (only 30 minutes from Carrie) and I invited her to my class showcase, I figured she wouldn't come. The show started and she wasn't in the audience. No one came to see me. Then right before the second part of the show stared (the part I was in) I saw Carrie and her friend (Call her Abby) walk in and sit off to the side. I was so touched that she made it. After the show I gave her a huge hug, and we went around the city, we got burgers, went to the big Christmas tree in the middle of the city, and it began to snow. I got a beautiful picture of Carrie right in front of the tree... she still has it as her profile picture all these months later. It was a magical night.\n\nFebruary comes along. And she invites me to her birthday party in her basement. That night in December was so magical... I was willing to do anything to catch that feeling again... so I dragged my best friend along, call him Mario, two hours for a simple little basement party... I caught it again. Carrie barely talked to any of her other friends. It felt just like me and her... at one point she brought up how she keeps going out with assholes... and that she needed a sweet guy, because her bf was being an asshole. I didn't want to be that guy, you know? Talking about the guy who's over seas... serving our county... it didn't feel right... so I called it a night before anything else could happen.On the drive home I told Mario how much I enjoyed myself, and he told me how he really \"vibed\" with Abby, Carrie's friend. It was a good night for the both of us.\n\nI just needed to tell her how much she meant to me. So while I was at a bar a few nights later... exactly at midnight, the beginning of Valentine's Day... I send her this text,\n\n\"I wanted to tell you this at your birthday party the other night, but the right time never came up, and I'm no good at being serious, but... I've always been sort of a loner, But getting to know you has made my life feel a lot less lonely. Knowing you gives me hope that I don't have to be alone for the rest of my life. If it takes me another twenty-three years to find someone half as special as you I'll die happy. Thanks for being my friend! And you should never forget how awesome you are!\"\n\nI sent that text without knowing she had broken up with her boyfriend twenty minutes before. She was gracious... and it was a win for me. March came around! Carrie and Abby invited me and Mario to the city for a few drinks on St. Patrick's day. It was a no brainer. We got to the bar a few hours before the girls. So we walked around in the snow for a bit. We went in the bar right before happy hour ended, and we drank. Waiting and waiting. I sent a text telling them to hurry up so I could buy them a round... I kept drinking. They finally said they were almost there. I ordered a round of Jamison... they finally arrive and Carrie didn't want to drink. I was already so far gone, probably the drunkest I've been since the time I blacked out and woke up in the hospital... Abby said Carrie was freaking out, that she hadn't eaten, and she wasn't going to drink. Carrie said she needed some air, so I ask if I could go with her. We got outside and Carrie was looking around really hard, trying to find someone. And suddenly she got visibly upset... even visible for me, an almost black out drunk guy... \"He's making out with another girl, oh my god! Don't look! I hate everything, I hate life.\"\n\nShe rushes inside, and I'm trying to process what the fuck is going on. She's crying on Abby's shoulder. I go up to Mario, and I tell him \"I think she's here for another guy. I was her back up plan.\" And for the second time... I cried over Carrie...\n\nCarrie was inconsolable the whole night. Complaining about this guy, she was denying herself any pleasure of having fun. I couldn't leave either I still had to sober up before I could make it back to my train, let alone drive. And I was being a good bro, being wingman to Mario... listening to Carrie- leaving Abby open for Mario to put the moves on. It became miserable... but toward the end of the night I snapped, I wasn't going to deny myself any pleasure. The band was playing... everyone was dancing... I started jumping, my heart was racing.... I just started smashing the ground. I saw the guy Carrie was crying over and I smashed into him, I smashed into Mario... and at this tiny little Ren Faire themed bar I started a mosh pit on St Patrick's day.\n\nThe four of us left. We went for a walk... Mario and Abby lead, and I just listened to Carrie. I was cracking jokes, trying to make her smile... but nothing. Misery. Mario and Abby walked into a convenient store, Carrie and I stayed outside and talked... I got fed up, and still drunk I asked, \"you do know I really love you, right?\"\n\nHer face turned red, and she timidly said, \"yeah\".\n\nI told her I just didn't understand why I was invited at all. The others came back and we started our way to the train station, but Carrie and Abby didn't understand the subway system... so I had to figure out for them how to make it back to Carrie's grandmother's apartment. They were still concerned... so Mario and I Had to take them back to Grandma's... 30 minutes out of the way. Carrie tried to \"pay me for my troubles\". But I couldn't take it.\n\nMario and I finally get back to the train station... we were ten minutes late... and the next train wasn't for another four hours. It was a defeat for me... but Mario got a kiss...\n\nMay (this month! We're almost there, thanks for reading this far!) I get a text from Carrie, asking if I was going to be at the ren Faire auditions. I wasn't because I already had my role secured from the previous season. I told her I wasn't, but my Improv class is in the same building, so maybe we could meet up after. She said yeah.\n\nBut I forgot I didn't have class that day, we were off for Mother's Day. But I was going into the city anyway to see some improv shows... and the past month was tough... I took Willow to the improv show. We forgave and forgot anything that happened in the past. And I really tried to move past Carrie.\n\nThe thing about dating a girl with emotion recognition problems is that you have to learn to live with it. I had to continually remind myself that she loved me even tho It was hard for me to see it. Another issue with Willow was she didn't give herself enough love. She constantly joked about suicide, she's been in and out of special hospitals, she's on pills. It is difficult.\n\nSo while out with Willow in the city, I got a text from Carrie asking if I wanted to meet up. I told her I forgot, my class was cancelled... despite being on the same block as her. I didn't tell a lie... but it also wasn't the full truth... just another broken promise.\n\nThis week, my birthday! Last minute I decide to throw a party, my birthday/ Memorial Day, and I decided to invite anyone that ever meant anything to me. All my friends, and all my family. That included Willow and Carrie. I didn't expect Carrie would come. I'm probably the only person stupid enough to drive two hours just for a birthday party...\n\nBoth girls RSVPd yes. But I didn't think Carrie was actually going to do it. I figured it would be another broken promise. The day comes, all my friends, and family show up. Willow is one of the first guests (as she lives a few blocks over). Two hours into the party I look at my phone. It's from Carrie \"We're here\".\n\nI go out front, Carrie and Abby come out of the car, Mario is running to catch up behind me... and Carrie is wearing this breathtaking thin white dress. Her back was exposed... and when she came in for a hug she felt as delicate as a small bird.\n\nThe magic came back... but it was different, because before she had always been far away... but now she was here. Present at my residence.\n\nI grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to introduce her to everyone. I was so happy. We began to drink. I tried to be a good host and talk to everyone but in between visits to grandparents, co workers, and old high school friends, every stop I'd go to Carrie. I'd spend 10 minutes with Carrie and 5 with anyone else. Until I just didn't talk to anyone else. We were a couple drinks in...\n\nWillow tugs me by the sleeve. I totally forgot her father was an alcoholic.

    "selftext": "I moved out of my parent's house a few months ago. I didn't ask for any help financially, but my dad offered to buy me two tires for my car when I needed a new set. I thanked him for the offer and told him I'd let him know.\n\nWell, I'm at the point where I need new tires. I called a few places and got some rates, giving them to my dad. He sent me some websites that sold tires cheaper than a lot of other places, and he recommended a couple brands.\n\nHis top recommendation was General. Now, I don't know much about tires or cars in general, but the reviews online were promising. After some research, I found some Goodyear tires that were cheaper than General. Originally I would've had no problem buying the more expensive tires, but my medical bills have been through the roof. I've been sick on and off this year (pink eye, flu, bronchitis, hand foot and mouth, and strep). I also had to make a late night trip to the hospital after a bad reaction to my birth control.\n\nSo basically I have to cut costs somewhere, and tires are one of the view things I can budge. Hell, I'm already cancelling therapy sessions because I can no longer afford them.\n\nI told my dad I'm probably going to get the Goodyear tires once my next paycheck rolls around. He insists that that's a bad brand and I should get the General tires and cut costs somewhere else. I already buy basically ramen and pasta for groceries. Sure, I keep some money around for leisure because I'd go nuts if I couldn't do anything fun once in a while. I told him that while I appreciate his advice and him helping me buy the tires, this was not in the original agreement and I feel like he's not letting me make my own decision.\n\nI could understand if he was saying \"Hey, I'm buying you these tires. Can you pay for the other two?\" But no, he asked me to let him know when I was going to purchase new tires so he could help foot the bill. He never once said it had to be this brand or that.\n\nAnd if Goodyear is a shit tire that'll only last me a year, that's fine. A lot of my bills just recently went down in cost. Auto insurance just went down because I JUST hit three years of driving. Medical bills should go down because my immune system will (hopefully) be leveled out by then (it's my new job that's caused all the illnesses. It's a daycare). My phone AND car will be paid off by next year, so those bills will be gone. Simply put, I SHOULD have more money next year. Yeah, shit might happen. But shit's also happening now.\n\nI've half a mind to tell him I don't want his help anymore with the tires and that I'll buy 4 by myself, but that doesn't save me any money. And I don't know if I'm financially in a situation to do that. I don't have a credit card to put them on. My boyfriend does, but I don't like to ask him for any help financially. We cover our bills ourselves and split things 50/50.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: Here's the conversation between my dad and I.\n\nMe: I think I'm gonna get these ones. They cost the same to ship down here as they do in [his town, an hour north of mine], and it'd be easier to get them put on down here. [insert link to tires online]\n\nDad: Not to dictate what tire you get but I wouldn't buy these tires. They get really bad reviews. Go to Goodyear eagle rs-a tire reviews at www.1010 tires. com (491 reviews ) As a rule Goodyear tires don't get good reviews\n\nMe: On other sites they have good reviews. Dad I don't have a lot of money.\n\nDad: Some of those other reviews are more about the site than the tire itself\n\nMe: I'll have to see\n\nDad: Good tires are important \n\nMe: I know they are, but my budget is tight.\n\nDad: Skimp elsewhere\n\nMe: I can't. Dad, I appreciate that you're willing to help me out with tires. But I feel like I'm not allowed to make my own decision on this.\n\nDad: Those generals can be found reasonably priced \n\nMe: That's not the point.\n\nDad: The point is the difference between the Goodyear and General for you is $27.62 for a far better tire. Small price to pay for assurance. \n\nMe: I have never heard of anyone say Goodyear was a bad tire.\n\nDad: [screenshot of a bad review for Goodyear tires]\n\nMe: [screenshot of a good review for Goodyear tires]\n\nThat's all for now.",

(I  also know that when a woman constantly accuses you of cheating, and you know you're not, then they're probably the ones cheating.) 2 days after that, she came over and we talked so she could have closure. I guess she construed it as I want to get back together, which is far from the case. So she wants to give me a second chance that I didn't ask for. So this morning, she calls me and asks if I want to hang out with her, I say no, I have things I need to take care of. Rent's due and such. And she goes on this tangent about how I'm an asshole and how she was so in love with me, and I betrayed her and all this hoopla.

I'll call my housemate with the dog Rachel, and my other housemate Holly.\n\n* First of all it was \u201cTrixie might be staying with us one night some time soon\u201d. Cool. Fine.

I wanted a chocolate cake. \"Your cousin can't have chocolate, pick white\", my dad said. \"It's my birthday and I can't have a chocolate cake? We could just get him a smaller cake or cupcake or something or at least that for me\", I said back. \"No, that's too much food, we'll just get white\", he said.

    "selftext": "So last year I got to know a girl through a common interest, lets call her Lucy. She was great and we really hit it off early on, so much that I started crushing a bit on her. About a week later I get the chance to make a move while following her home from a bar. I am rejected as she makes it clear that she has a boyfriend and that she lives together with him. At this point I'm obviously a bit disappointed, but decided to continue the friendship as just good friends, and after a while this friendship feels pretty platonic.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I become acquainted with Lucys boyfriend, a very nice guy who's also (somewhat) interested in the activity I met her through. We get along quite well, but never get to the point where I would call him a good friend of mine. We all go to the same university and meet eachother regularly.\n\nBoth me and Lucy finished our exams early this year, and because of this we had decided hanging out basically every day for the last two weeks (first for an event that lasted four days, later for drinking etc). We have a great time together, and I notice that I start having feelings towards her again, but surpress them, knowing she has a boyfriend. During this time her boyfriend seems rather absent, until one day he turns up at a party together with Lucy and gets drunk. When outside smoking he opens up to me and explains that he's been going through the death of a close family member just a month ago, that he had quit school for the time being and was having a really rough time. I try to comfort him as good as I can and I still feel really bad for him.\n\nHere's where things get pretty shitty. Lucy is very touchy with guys in general, even with good friends of her boyfriend. Earlier when I'd been to parties with her and her boyfriend together he doesn't really seem to mind it. He's a very confident, good looking guy in general so I honestly wasn't too surprised that he hasn't felt \"threatened\" by this. Due to his absence at our parties for the last week though, and due to the situation he was in, I had decided I would not come close to Lucy physically as it felt really wrong.\n\nOne night we're at an afterparty together with some other common friends (once again without Lucys boyfriend) and we're all sitting/laying down in the hosts bed. We're all drunk, and Lucy starts laying very close to me. I started feeling uncomfortable and decided leaving the bed and started talking to some other friends in the living room instead. after the party Lucy and I walk home together, and we end up talking about the episode and she seems a bit annoyed at me. I tell her \"Sorry, I know I'm being weird and I know that you mean nothing by what you're doing, but I feel really bad about it anyway\". She tells me it's OK and that she understands, and we split up for the day.\n\nTwo days later we end up at an afterparty at my house, now with the boyfriend present. I get extremely drunk and end up passing out in my bed with Lucy and another friend sitting beside me. It turns out that Lucys boyfriend was mad after arguing with one of his friends about something unrelated. This had ruined the mood and everyone except Lucy left the party without me knowing (laying drunk in my room). I wake up next to her in my bed and she starts cuddling with me. This time I end up obliging. I knew it was wrong, but I also have a crush on her and had a weak moment. She starts looking at me and tells me that she's in love with me, and I tell her I feel the same way. We kiss for a second, but I immediately feel really shitty about it and tell her to leave. On her way out she tells me she's sorry, that I shouldn't worry about this and that it's not my fault, but I'm very unsure about the whole thing personally.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but how do you guys feel about this? Am I the asshole for letting things go this far?",

When I check Facebook yesterday and see all of the pictures posted from the party I find out that not only did my old friend show up, she brought people with her. People that, even if we were still friends, I would never let her invite or let near any of my family functions and my mother and sister know that.

We were friends from the beginning of high school up to about 2 years out of high school. I noticed that she did things that friends shouldn't do. Things like if I liked someone and she knew, she would end up sleeping with them and she only wanted to hang out if I promised we'd be drinking. It's been 4 years now since I've last seen her but this whole time, my mother and little sister have continued to not only talk to her but actually hang out with her. And I really didn't give a shit, I honestly thought it was kind of sad that my mom would still hang out and party with someone her own daughter cut out. I started getting upset when I found out that this person was going to my family events that I couldn't make and she was invited by my mother or sister because they knew I wouldn't be there. Now, my sister is having her open house this weekend and I found out that this person will be there. So I called my sister and asked her if she was really going to be there and my sister decided to throw a fit, crying about how it's her party and she can have whoever she wants there and that I'm being a child if I'm really not going to come because someone I don't like is going to be there. So I just said yeah, I'm totally the problem and decided that I'm staying home that day.  So am I really the asshole here?",

At this point, he asks me what I want to do, and I say that I just want to spend some time together this evening before he leaves. He tells me that he'll tell his friends that he needs to leave soon so that they'll hurry up and finish their food, but obviously I don't want him to rush their meal on my behalf, so I ask him not to do that. He asks if it would be best for him to grab an uber to his place, where I can meet him, and I say yeah, that'd probably be ideal.\n\nProblem is, I feel like an asshole for hassling him, but I also feel pretty strung along.

On this particular Friday evening, my husband agreed to watch a particular movie with me. This is weird, because I am notorious for not having seen a lot of movies. However, I fancy the ones I have seen and remember are pretty good.\n\nI suggested said movie because he said he wanted to watch a movie that I would like. Also, he tends to feel like he has to spend a chunk of money on us going out, which I feel guilty about, and he's a bit of a natural homebody. I don't want to be stressful -- though a movie might not be my first choice for every Friday, it's a great compromise since I understand he has to recharge some weekends.\n\nI also have wanted to share this movie with him for literally many years, because it's one of my all-time favorites. So, I figure, low-stress, low-cost Friday night full of snuggles. Hey, if he's asking my opinion on what movie to watch, let's watch this one he's heard me rave about.\n\nWe also had friends online, on voice chat, playing some games. Fair enough, it's good to interact with people we both like! We do that most weeknights but there's no quota for friendship!\n\nBoth of us played a few games.

We joke and laugh on voice chat about it, I hope gently. Our movie date was asked about, since I had said, \"hey, it's great to hear everyone but after this we're probably going to watch a movie.\"\n\nEventually husband starts yawning and says he's going to log off/go to sleep.

That he's promised to watch movies with me in the past and hasn't followed through. \n\nHey gets mad because he's\u200b tired right now, and what is he supposed to do about it other than sleep.

He starts the movie because he feels he now has to watch it, over my protests that now he will fall asleep and miss most of it/resent me for it, and I'd really appreciate it if he'd just save the energy to watch it sometime... And falls asleep midday through. I'm pretty mad at this point and say that it's no surprise he fell asleep and that's why I wanted to take a rain check but that I'm pretty disappointed in how the evening had gone, considering. He threw his glasses on the ground and I'm sleeping on the couch.\n\nI feel like an asshole because a movie should never be a huge commitment. A movie should be on the lowest rung of priority on a Friday night. And I get that. From my point of view, a movie *was* on the lowest rung of commitment, but I saved energy for it.\n\nFrom his point of view I get that he's tired, that he will fall asleep during this movie, and that when he's already tired it's probably unfair of me to berate him for not having saved the energy. I don't want to be that person who is super vigilant/quizzes people around me about the movie I made them sit through in the first place. But he suggested it, which makes me conflicted?\n\nOf all the things I have energy for in my life, movies are on the lowest rung/are a fallback that I hope other people would be able to let go and forgive me for.\n\nBut I'm pretty upset that he has chosen to not save enough energy to follow through on the most low-energy plan I can think of, when he agreed.\n\nAt the same time, I totally get why friends in voice chat might take precedence. Friends &gt; movie, for sure.\n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole? Keeping in mind of course, and as I'm sure you know, that while I'm trying not to pile on the person I'm mad at, because I definitely could be in the wrong, I have probably biased this post strongly in my own favor.\n\nEdit: oh shit I forgot a tl;dr!\n\nTl;Dr: I might be an asshole getting upset about a movie, because movies are a weird thing to prioritize on date night. But, it was my husband's suggestion that I pick a movie, so now I surrender to Reddit's judgement on relative assholery.",

The last time I saw her was at her wedding, and the time before that was probably when we were children. She's maybe 10 years older than me. So someone in her family, either her mother or aunt (so one of my mother's aunts, my great aunts) threw the shower I believe. An invite was sent to my mother's house addressed to my mother, my sister (who is 19 and lives with my parents), and myself. I am and have lived in my own home with my fianc\u00e9 for 2 years. \n\nI thought it was terribly rude that I wasn't sent a separate invitation. I understand that because I am not very close to her, she likely doesn't know where I live. I don't know where she lives, I didn't even know she was having a baby, and I don't know what's going on in any of my mom's aunts personal lives so I certainly don't blame them for not knowing that I've gotten engaged and moved. Given all of that, I would not invite them to something intimate like a baby shower. If we haven't spoken in so long that we aren't aware of each other's life circumstances, I don't think that's genuinely a person you want celebrating with you. I feel like it was just an afterthought, or even a gift grab. My mother's aunts (who sent the invitations) speak to my grandmother frequently enough that they could have reached out and asked for my address, although I think an invite was unnecessary at all. My grandmother and mother disagree that this was rude. I don't think anyone was the asshole... So I guess AmIPetty? Or was this rude?",

She listened and revoked her offer, much to his disappointment. \n\nMy question: If this would have gone down exactly as he explained (he sends the money and she sees it in her PayPal account), is there any way this could be a scam &amp; he could take the money back?

    "selftext": "To start, this isn't me. This is between my sister (16 yo) and my father's girlfriend (Late 40s, unsure of exact age). I'm the brother (18yo) who is just trying to study for exams and shit's happening in the background.\n\nMy sister has always been prone to moon swings and stuff, and even moreso since our mother died a bit over 2 years ago. My dad has recently met his first woman since, he met her back around November time and she and her daughter (12 yo) moved in about 2 months ago. My sister doesn't like her, although the exact reason I can't pinpoint. Regardless, its not like she goes around picking fights, so its tolerable.\n\nThe issue normally comes when the girlfriend tries to tell my sister what to do in a 'strict motherly' way, which my sister doesn't like so she talks back, then shit kicks off. One observation I have is that my Dad's girlfriend has the maturity of a teenager it seems. Whenever anything goes down she leaves the house in a strop and drives around for a few hours before coming back, there are some cases in particular I'll refer to later.\n\nOkay, so as a result of mood swings 'n' shit, the family as a whole have convinced my sister to go to therapy. My sister didn't want my Dad's partner (Who I'll call Anne) or her daughter to know (Especially not the daughter as they go to the same school. The daughter seems fine but she just didn't want her to know). Anne was getting pretty aggravated about being kept in the dark on everything, which is basically where the main issue lies. So my Dad told her, she in turn told her daughter despite being told specifically not to, then shit broke loose (Although my sister never found out). An example of Anne's immaturity is when my sister did something to upset her, nothing major by any means just some snide comment or something, and she spent the entire weekend giving her the silent treatment and generally acting like a bitch to everyone until my sister apologised. Like come on, you're acting immature for a teenager, let alone a fully grown woman, grow up.\n\nSo anyway, my sister went to councelling for the first time earlier today. Nothing particularly interesting happened, but she doesn't want Anne knowing, which I think is fair. So my Dad comes home from work, A asks him how it went and my Dad tells her that my sister doesn't want her knowing.  So Anne is now currently having another strop that she and her daughter feel out of place in this house and feel excluded. She's currently out on her drive now, so we've come to this position and I'm posting. I feel like my sister is refusing to tell her out of spite, but I don't think it should matter why she doesn't want A to know, its her information to give.\n\nI'm looking for a way to resolve this issue with causing minimal harm to my Dad. He's a really great guy and A is alright most of the time, and he's just getting torn in half. \n\nThis is probably the wrong sub, but I can't see any other subs that fit the bill and I could really do with some help on this.",

    "selftext": "Update: She got home from work and wants me to apologise \n\nTLDR: My job requires me to sleep early, partner prevented me from sleep. She's mad at me for pointing it out. \n\nSo first some context. I work early mornings and have to be awake for work between 02:50am and 05:50am, so getting a good night's sleep is important to me.\n\nMy partner likes to watch TV before bed and won't do it in the living room as she likes to fall asleep to it too, we've only been living together 3 months and I could tell I was going to have to get ear plugs straight away. However, often I feel like the TV could be a little quieter as I can still hear it relatively cleary. Whenever I ask her to turn it down she responds with \u201cI can't hear it\u201d but what I think is happening is she just wants to keep it at a comfortable level. When the roles have been reversed I've turned the TV down to a level where I can just about here it so she can sleep, bearing in mind she never has to be up super early. \n\nSo last night I wanted to start trying to sleep at 9pm, I put my ear plugs in and turned over. The TV though was very loud, at least for that time and when someone is trying to sleep. It was at the level I have it on in the day sometimes. I ask her to turn it down and she says \u201cCan we not do this again\u201d and I respond with silence to try and keep the peace. I try for an hour to try and get to sleep but I just can't, so I start playing with my phone hoping she'll get the hint. \n\nShe asks me why I'm not sleeping and I gesture towards the TV. It's at this point she gets really defensive. Now I'm a little grouchy, but she seems offended that I'd even ask. The subtitles are on, so why not turn it down if you can read it? I didn't ask this as I thought she wasn't going to listen. \n\nI get up and say I'm going to go sleep on the couch, to which she becomes more agitated and eventually says she'll go sleep on the couch instead. While leaving the room she says it's not all about me and \u201cwhat if I can't sleep!?\u201d and slams the bedroom door. \nShe eventually comes back in and goes to sleep, I'm still up as the altercation made me very awake. \n\nIn the morning I'm leaving for work and I hear her ask me \u201cno kiss?\u201d (I usually kiss her before leaving) and I respond with a no, and walk out the door. \n\nSo I get home from work and it's still morning, she's at her work. After an hour I go to turn the TV on to find the remote had gone missing, I thought maybe it had fallen beneath the sofa. To my surprise I find the laptop under there! It's at this point I knew she'd hidden the remote/taken it in her bag and she'd also hidden the PS4 remote. Then she messages me later on saying \u201cHope you're having a whale of a time with no remote or controller\u201d \n\nSOME OF THE PETTIEST SHIT EVER! ",

Let's call her \"Picky.\"\n\n\nPicky is a juvenile/sheltered eater: plain chicken and rice and pasta are her main meals, takes lettuce and tomato off her burger, minimal seasonings and veggies, didn't know what a kiwi was in person and never tried hot chocolate until she was well into her 20s. Weird mix. I can never guess what she will or will not eat because it varies wildly. She has no medical dietary restrictions. Despite this she never makes a fuss of her food out loud, if she does its a meek whisper to Roommate. She's a nice girl who fits with our friend group well.\n\n\nBack to the birthday party. Most guests are mutual friends with Roommate and Picky too. The time comes to order pizza from my fianc\u00e9's favorite pizza place where we crowd around the computer looking at their menu and deciding what toppings to get. Normal pizza topping decisions are discussed and made by all. (If it matters, I think we decided on a veggie, a pepperoni and sausage, and a cheese.)\n\n\nRight before we call to order, Roommate has us add a specific chicken finger meal for Picky. I do not recall the exact exchange of words. This is for her only, not to share by the other guests. She could have expressed her pizza preferences along with everyone else, but didn't. I don't think she had any pizza other than sampling a bite at Roommate's coaxing.\n\n\nI paid for the entire order myself as it was the main food for the party. However, I and my fianc\u00e9 both felt I should be paid back for Picky's specific meal.\n\n\nLater in the night Roommate and I are alone in the kitchen where I matter of factly ask him if he/Picky has cash for her meal or if he'd Venmo to pay me back. (I worded it this way on purpose to avoid any sort of \"Where going to pay me back?\" awkwardness) He paid me back and that was the end of it. I had no resentful vibes from him or Picky at all for this, but then again they're both very non confrontational and could have grumbled about it in private. Did they complain or didn't they?

I sent him a few chagrined messages when I found out asking why he wouldn't try to let me know what the actual delay was, and I feel like I might have been too harsh.

    "selftext": "Okay, I just found this sub and think it will help me with something I experienced today. I have a new job, three weeks in, at a grocery store chain I used to work at. The last store was super relaxed, so I kind of assumed this would be similar. Today I was scheduled to work till 6 and it hits a quarter till, so I don't have time to load up another cart and stock because by the time I get it to the floor I'll have to clock out and it's rude just to leave a full cart in the back room. So I track down my co-worker, who isn't technically an assistant manager, but the managers trust him and he kind of has seniority when no one is around. I tell him I'm taking off, and he says, \"You're scheduled till 6.\" \n\nI check my phone and the wall clock thinking it must be nearly five, not six, but nope both clocks say it's 5:48. I mumble something like oh okay. I'll find something to do. I go and get ready to clean the produce cooler, but I forgot the broom and it's back over by my coworker. When I walk past him I ask if our manager is strict about things like this because at m- (he cuts me off before I can finish explaining that they were pretty chill at the last store.) \n\nHe says, \"Why would he schedule you to six if he didn't want you to stay till six. I'm not mad at you, but that's what the schedule is for.\"\n\n\"Okay, I was just curious because I'm new and if they don't like me leaving a little early I need to know.\"\n\nHe says \"Yep.\" and doesn't look up from the corn he is cutting. \n\nI go clean the cooler and then help him stack some things off and around 6:11 he says I can leave if I want. The thing is he was scheduled to leave at 6 also. If the managers care so much about the schedule won't they car about him staying late?\n\nI also think he might have just been short with me because of another incident. So a week prior to this I ran out of some prescription meds and was having bad migraines as a result, but he and another worker called of sick because one had the flu and the other (the cowork in question) had poison ivy. So my manager comes in to help out even though he was on vacation, but ultimately he asks me to stay late. Even though I have the migraine I stick with it because, you know, shit happens. No big deal. The next day I'm working with the coworker who was out with poison ivy. I just have a six hour shift from one to seven. A couple hours in my migraine comes back and I think well he was off yesterday, and I had to cover for him and stay late. He'll understand. I admit that is ass hole esqu of me. I should have toughed it out. Instead of tough it out I wait till I have two hours left when I know the store will get slow. Then I tell him I have a migraine ( I didn't mention the prescription meds because he doesn't need to know my medical business) and I say I'm going to take a long break and hope it goes away. If it did I would have stayed, but it didn't So I tell him I'm going home. He stops what he's doing and sighs, \"So what's going on exactly.\"\n\n\"Uhm.. Well I have a migraine.\" You know like I told you. He just stares at me and I feel nervous, so I say, \"I can try and find some one to cover for me.\" I felt bad about calling someone, but I was pretty sure they just wouldn't come in. I also though he would just tell me not to worry about it. Well he says nothing and goes back to what he was working on. I walk over to the schedule to see whose available and start entering in a number.\n\nHe shakes his head and says, \"I wouldn't worry about it.\"\n\nI say, \"Okay. Well have a good night sorry about this.\"\n\nHe waits till are turn to leave and lets out a large sigh that I would refer to as exasperate. \"I just wish you would work the last couple of hours, but go home if you have to I guess.\"\n\nI didn't think either of these things would be that big of a deal to him because both times there were hardly anyone in the store. Maybe it's just because I'm used to the bigger store I used to work at getting a lot more traffic, so it didn't seem bad to me. Maybe I'm the ass for leaving. Maybe he's the ass for his reactions. I'm trying to paint him as nicely as I can. I'm trying to be as objective as possible so here are the events. see any assholes here.\n\nedit: sorry for messing up the title\n\nEdit 2: well I guess I'm the ass hole. All I can do is change my behavior moving forward. At least it seems like this is the only guy who I've been an ass to. ",

    "selftext": "Today my girlfriend was upset she wasted $8 on a skirt she couldn't wear for various reasons. We were originally going to go out to eat and take a walk, but since she was torn by this she had me come to her place. I told her I was gonna buy the food first and that I'd be 20+ mins. She responded passively aggressively and acxused me of only going to her part of the city to eat. We argued a bit, I didn't buy food because the argument went on too long, and went to her place.\n\nShe started crying about wasting the $8 when I got there and I did my best to comfort her. After about 40 minutes I glanced at my watch during a hug to see the time and then adjusted the position on my wrist slightly. My girlfriend jumped back a bit and asked me if I was looking at the time. I said yeah and she bursted out crying.\n\nI checked the time because I was anxious about missing the tram I needed to get home without a 1+ hour walk after midnight. I explained this to her and she kept crying really hard and accusing me of not caring for her and etc. I tried to comfort her again but it just got worse.\n\nEventually I remarked that I didn't want to walk home alone so late at night and referenced a previous argument we've had because I left her a minute before we arrived at her apartment building (because she was acting awful at the tinr). She went into absolute hysterics. I'm not kidding when I say this is the absolute loudest I've ever heard anything cry or even scream out in pain. I was sure she was going to wake up the entire apartment building including her mother (who takes sleep medication and wears ear plugs). I'm almost convinced she was trying to be as loud as humanly possible. I know this is a weird thing to focus on but this was genuinely disturbing. She literally sounded like she was dying.\n\nAnd I know \"I'm almost convinced my girlfriend was trying to cry as loud as possible\" and saying it nonchalantly really makes me sound like a piece of shit but I have no other explanation for it. I'm not exaggerating at all. She has taken the death of family members better. I almost suspect she was being as loud as possible just to wake up her mother and put me in a very uncomfortable situation. All in all I feel this was a gross, gross overreaction and if intentional despicable. I don't think she WOULD do it just to get back at me but I don't know how she could've been so loud without intentionally trying to wake people up. Lile she was sitting there mouth wide open absolutely no attempts to cover her noises and generally not wake up the building (she can hear a cough from the neighbors).\n\nAnyway understandably - at least to me - I panicked the fuck out. She sounded like she was dying. At first I was like \"ok shit I'm leaving\" because I was clearly not helping the situation at all and generally panic. After the first few seconds I decided against it for obvious reasons.\n\nShe... \"calmed down\" a bit after that. Still crying profusely because I was worried about missing the tram. It was a bit before this point where there was no way in hell I'd be able to make the tram. Talked a bit yeah yeah she's still pissed I looked at my watch, etc etc, still maintaining crying for hours over wasting $8 and me looking at my watch wasn't an overreaction.\n\nSeveral times during I brought up that I didn't want to walk home so late. To which she replied that she would've paid for a taxi for me. Which is bullshit because she just got done crying for 40 mins over wasting $8. Mind you $8 that she likely could've gotten back from returning it and if not that reselling it. And she seemed almost offended at the idea that me not walking home alone late at night on mostly empty city streets was more important to me than consoling her over $8. Like yes, my satety and arriving home before 3am are more important than your minor inconvenience\n\nIf I seem cold or uncaring, I'm really not. Just tired and not in the best of moods and walking home right now. ",

    "selftext": "So... This happened on my last birthday. Some background. My wife and I are in our early 30's and married close to 10 years. We have an almost 1 y/o daughter that was going through a stretch of really struggling to sleep that was effectively sleep depriving both of us. \n\nMy birthday is sandwiched in between Xmas and New Years so it's normally kinda an afterthought throughout most of my life. I'm used to it though, and really never cared that much about birthdays anyways-(usually small scale, quiet simple nights out). My wife's parents were also in from out of town for the holidays. \n\nWell about a week before they got here I looked at our calendar and noticed her family was flying back home the night of my birthday. I know one or both of us normally takes them to the airport for their flight home (it's like a 40 minute drive). No big deal. Figured we would probably just pick a different day/night to celebrate anyways (we often do this when birthdays fall in the middle of the week and celebrate the weekend before or after). Mind you we obv still tell each other happy birthday when the day comes.\n\nWell, morning of, she doesn't say anything about it. I make a point of asking her multiple times before leaving for work that day what our schedule is for the evening and the upcoming weekend. Never a mention. I leave kinda sad/shocked. Day rolls by at work and we always periodically text each other while we're working. She reiterates to me she's just gonna take her parents to dinner/airport after she's done with work, asks me to pick up our daughter from daycare and that she will be home late because their flight is pretty late.\n\nAt this point I'm torn between feeling pretty crushed my own wife forgot my birthday or she's running some con on me and planning a surprise party. Rest of my day at work rolls by slow as molasses, pick up the little girl from daycare, and head home to what I'm holding out hope is some sort of surprise party at our house.\n\nWalk in to an empty house. Have fun playing with the little one, get her ready for bed. Lay around a bit and get a text around 10 that she's on her way home. Fall asleep before she gets home.\n\nNext morning goes by as if nothing has happened. She's sad/crying from her parents being gone, baby not sleeping great etc. Both of us leave for work with no mention of my birthday that just passed. Around noon she calls me crying/ apologizing. Says it just slipped her mind and why didn't I say something about it and tell her?\n\nReally I think she finally figured out she missed my birthday because she probably saw people commenting on my Facebook page saying happy birthday. Without that, I feel there is no way she ever would've even known. I just told her it wasn't that big of a deal, we're both sleep deprived, her family being in town had schedules out of wack, and birthdays aren't a big deal to me anyways. Was I sad? Of course, but there's not really anything at that point that could be done to fix it because what hurt was her completely forgetting, not the missing out on whatever run of the mill celebration we would've done.\n\nNow Father's Day is almost here. Again it's not a huge deal, but we're a day away from it and I virtually know she doesn't have anything planned and seems like she has no idea it's tomorrow. Should I just tell her instead of being quiet? AITA for not telling her about my birthday when I thought she might have forgotten? AITA for not reminding her it's Father's Day this weekend?  \n\n",

    "selftext": "I hope you'll forgive the super longevity. This is kind of a two-part story in a retail workplace environment and some of the detail is important. I work in a small 2 story building (w/basement) that has very limited parking for both employees and customers. I kind of adopted the 'parking lot nazi' role as my job includes maintenance of the property, and because I would often hear stories from the retail people that customers would often complain about lack of parking. This is mainly because random people will use our lot to park and then go and go to a nearby festival for hours, or have lunch elsewhere or whatever, despite multiple, very prominent signs alerting them that they will be towed.\n\nThe first of the two-part event occurred around October several years ago. There was a mystery car parked in the section of the lot reserved for employees that worked on the 2nd floor, and it had been there all morning. No one on the retail floor recognized the car, nor did two different employees on the 2nd floor, so I called the tow company. They answered the phone, but our tow guys are notoriously unreliable. I think I might have even called them twice, but they never showed. Sometime that afternoon, the car was no longer there and another employee from the 2nd floor was alerted to the fact that the tow company was called to remove this car. It turned out to be his wife's car, and he was very upset, even though the car wasn't towed (the tow guy has to come in to get a paper signed if a car is removed, and that didn't happen). I went upstairs immediately, feeling awful about this situation, explained what had happened, apologized profusely and said it wouldn't happen again as I decided I wasn't going to monitor parking any longer.\n\nAn hour or so after that back on the retail floor, one of the workers away from the counter had heard the update to the situation and proceeded to berate me in a very loud voice. She went on for a good 20 or 30 seconds shouting about how upset the guy on the 2nd floor was, how I must certainly have better things to be doing, how she should speak to our supervisor about it, what was I thinking, what was the matter with me, etc., loud enough that everyone at the counter and in the lobby could hear it. There was a second girl who was apparently speaking to the first girl before she started shouting at me, and the second one stood there with her mouth open as the scene seemed to drag out forever. There was a surreal moment after she finished; save for the elevator music at the counter, no other voices for several stunned seconds.\n\nI was numbly mortified; embarrassed and humiliated. I'm not a confrontational person in the least, and I slunk off after the girl was finished, saying nothing, went downstairs and cried. I was physically sick. I spent the next few weeks avoiding any contact whatsoever with this girl with a single-mindedness that bordered on fanatical. The event was never brought up again. On the rare occasions that I happened to be in her unfortunate presence, she pretended nothing was amiss.\n\nWeeks pass. Now it's Christmastime, and we come to the 2nd half of my two-part story. I looked forward to this season with dread now, as this girl made a point every year to present everyone with a little Christmas trinket, and I prayed that, this year, she would not give me one. It was not to be. I found my trinket among my paperwork table one day, and I stared at it, talking to myself. Then I picked it up and walked it to the break room where I knew she was at this time of the day, and that she was alone. I put it down in front of her and I said I could not accept it. She asked me why, and I studied her for several seconds to see if I could tell if she really had no idea. I could feel my chest tightening up already, so I knew I had to finish this quickly. I reminded her that a couple of months ago she had humiliated me in front of everyone within earshot and those that craned their heads around to see, and that I was very uncomfortable accepting a gift from her. She avoided eye contact, said okay, and I walked out. \n\nFrom that moment forward she was pissed at me, and made every effort to show it; speaking to me through intermediaries if she absolutely had to, or leaving me notes. Otherwise not speaking at all, which was fine. \n\nIt's been a couple of years now since that happened, and though she never apologized for that scene, the sharp edges have dulled quite a bit. There's conversation between us on occasion, but she's never again given me a Christmas present. I still wonder though. Was I an asshole for what I did?\n",

    "selftext": "Ok so here's some background. Let's call the girl who's the other part of this situation Carly. I am 15 and Carly is 16. Carly and I have been sort of a thing for around a month. School got out on May 26th and I asked her to be my girlfriend on June 1st. She said yes. The thing was that I leave every summer to visit my dad so there'd be a 2 and 1/2 month long amount of time where we couldn't see each other at the very beginning of our relationship.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and she starts telling me that I'm too mean to her and that she's contemplating breaking up with me. This is news to me because I don't even know what I've said to her that's mean and I know if I said a mean thing that I was kidding. As an example, I said that her laugh was the ugliest laugh ever but I thought she could tell that I was kidding because I was laughing. She said that there were other times that she says that happened when I wasn't laughing and sounded very serious, but she couldn't give me an example. She says she doesn't remember what I said but remembers how it made her feel. Anyway, I ended up breaking up with her because I'm a jokey guy and if she was gonna be this sensitive, I thought we probably weren't compatible. I immediately regretted it and spent the next week begging her to take me back but she always said she was thinking about it. She said that her mom insults her a lot and it hurts her self-esteem, so she couldn't take it from her boyfriend too. I still didn't know what I said that was this insulting but I understood. I promised that I wouldn't joke around anymore and I stayed to that in our phone conversations and such. This brings us to yesterday.\n\nI had decided that yesterday would be the day that I would ask her to be my girlfriend again. That evening, she texted me saying she wanted to talk and that she was drunk. I called her and found out that she wasn't lying and was, in fact, very drunk. This upset me because she had said to me before that she wasn't gonna drink anymore because of a prior situation where she accidentally sent her nudes to some creep who, after that, kept sitting next to her on the bus because he thought she wanted her.\n\nAnyway, she brought the video call with her into the bathroom. She started stripping off her clothes and she said she was about to shower which is pretty much our code for she's going to send nudes. We've never done anything live before. I said no. You're drunk. I'm not going to take advantage of you. Call me after you shower and get dressed.\n\nShe was pissed! She started sending me nudes on snapchat with captions like I hate you, etc. She also starts sending me pictures of her crying with similar captions. She started posting about me on instagram with captions like \"HRS A SBAKE!!!! DONT RUTS HIM!!!\" which means \"He's a snake. Don't trust him\" in drunk teenage girl. I told her to calm down and just call me after she gets dressed. She responds with a video of her with scissors on her thigh because she knows I know she's depressed and suicidal. She eventually just starts saying \" I hate you\" \"Kill yourself\" \"I'm going to go back to *ex's name here*\" \"*ex's name here* would love me\". I just kept saying that I loved her.\n\nA few minutes later, I see that our mutual friend has started a live stream and I join. She says that I should leave Carly alone, so I say \"Wtf she needs to leave me alone\". She screenshotted that and sent it to Carly. Carly got sad that I said that and posted some weird ass videos on her instagram of her like drinking water and crying and listening to Khalid. It's hard to describe. Just know that they weirded out everyone who watched them. The same friend who sent her the screenshot started asking me what was wrong. I told her that she was pissed about me hanging up on her on a video call but I hung up because she was getting naked and I didn't want to take advantage of her. She just says that she wants her to be ok. I start calling Carly and deduce that she had fallen asleep. I send her a text saying that I love her and will always be there for her, so that she'll have something nice to wake up to.I hope that she'll have came to her senses by then.\n\nI wake up that morning to Carly posting the screenshot of me saying that she should leave me alone and saying that she hates me. I text her saying that I didn't mean it and that I should've put if anything before it. I was just mad because she told me to leave Carly alone and Carly was the one bothering me. i told her I was just trying to help and she said that I just made things worse. She wasn't having it and told me to lose her social media and number, so I do. I block her on Instagram, snapchat, and her number. I post on instagram detailing what happened the night before because I know most people saw what went down. I included that part where she was stripping in the bathroom because I thought it was an important part of the story and the reason why I ended the video call with her, but I wrote it to make it seem like I had never seen her nudes before. Keep in mind that this was on my spam account and there's like a close-knit community of 15 or so spam accounts who all follow each other and like and comment on each other's posts, so I know that the people seeing this saw her breakdown on her account yesterday and her calling me a snake and saying she hates me, etc., so I wanted to tell my side and ask if I was in the wrong on anything.\n\nAnyway people keep telling me she wants to talk to me so I unblock her number and she starts getting pissed that I told her business. She says that I'm one of the only people she trusts to tell things to and that I betrayed her telling her business is a semi-public post like that. I agreed and said it was dumb and then I deleted it and apologized. She apologized for all the stuff she did yesterday even though she doesn't remember most of it. She says that i'm really the only person she trusts to say these thing to and doesn't like I told her our mutual friend what was happening even though she asked. I apologize again.I tell her that I was going to ask her out yesterday and she asks if I still want to. I said that I'm thinking about it.\n\nFast forward to now. She's telling me how much she loves me and doesn't understand why I don't want to date her anymore. I don't really know why either. I still want to date her and still love her. This whole situation just gives me a weird feeling about the future of the relationship or if it would even work. So Am I the Asshole? Also, is it a good idea for us to go out?",

It's one of the ways I express myself, and it's a fairly personal thing. I play for me. Im not a beginner at either but I'm also not super skilled. I like to play when nobody is home, or with headphones plugged in to the amp so only I can hear it. (Partially out of courtesy and partially out of a need for privacy). \n\nHere's my dilemma. My parents keep asking me to play them something, but I abhor the idea. I'm not confident with my skills enough to perform in front of anyone, and even if I was, I don't like being put on the spot like that. My refusal to share my music has been the topic of some contention. I've heard the supportive side from my mom, \"we don't expect you to be Jimi Hendrix, we just want to hear you play.\" As well as the more accusative side from my dad, \"What's the point of even playing music if you won't let anyone hear it?\"\n\nTo be fair, I didn't pay for either instrument, they were gifts from my parents. But they are making me feel like I owe them a performance. I've told them how personal it is to me, and compared what they were doing to forcing a teenage girl to read her diary aloud. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

This guy was tailing me fairly closely over the short distance of freeway I had to cross to get home. Mind you, I was driving about 65 in a 60. Once I pulled onto the off ramp and pulled into the right lane to turn right (it connects with another road so it's two lanes leading up to the light) and he zooms past me and pulls in front of me, turns, and speeds off into the night. \n\nI mean I get having a nice, fast car and wanting to drive it fast or wanting to get home quick because it's late, but does that piss anyone else off?

    "selftext": "I have a best friend, Jack, who is in his early 30s.\n\nI'm a woman in my mid 20s. Before I met Jack, I was raped twice.  I was suicidal for years following this and do not want to elaborate for obvious reasons.\n\nJack suspected this and was always very considerate. One night I very strongly implied what had happened to me. After that, Jack would randomly bring up \"fake feminists\" who make up fake rape accusations or accuse men of raping them by simply looking at a woman. The kind of fake posts you see on TIA. He never did this previously, and because I knew him, I could tell he actually believed that he was doing it to help me, in an extremely misguided *look OP, I'm on your side and I want to show that I'm against anyone who cheapens that word* way.\n\nThe second time he did this - in front of our coworkers, at the office no less - I sat in silence for ten minutes while he went on, staring at the table to stop myself from crying before I excused myself and blew his phone up later calling him out because how dare he start bringing that shit up at work when I had confided in him. That what he was doing was encouraging me that I did the right thing by never reporting what had happened because all people like him do is encourage the \"fake accusation\" thing and turn it into some fucking joke unless there's a man there giving his permission for a woman to call it that (for the record - what happened to me was textbook rape and I don't mean to dismiss male experiences). That the shit he was accusing those liars of, I had also been accused of and people like him were why victims never come forward. I was very harsh, and very upset.\n\nHe apologised sincerely and immediately. Told me that he had figured it out since before I implied it, that when I implied it that confirmed it to him, that he knew I was upset at the office but chose to \"keep going\" (??), and that what he did was fucked up but he sees now how offensive it was and he'd never do it again.\n\nA year later Jack moved eight hours away. A month ago, Jack tells me that he really cherishes our friendship and he's thankful that we're still mates. He hints towards our only fight by saying that he's sorry for the stupid shit he's said. He didn't really bring it up, and he let the subject drop. I kept the subject going and I mentioned how the person who did it to me later apologized but then also asked for pictures. Jack replies:\n\n&gt;to make light of the situation, which I'm not sure I should do, but to highlight it's ridiculousness.... \"hey you raped me\" \"yeah soz, hey got any sweet pics I can fap to later? Also I want to touch you, that cool?\"\n\nThat affected me. I know it's not as bad as the first time but he goes right back to making jokes about this, *right after* he apologized again and said he never would do it again. I didn't cuss him out this time, I made it clear that I never again wanted him to describe it as \"light hearted\" and that it was really fucked up. He did apologize again but it didn't feel as sincere because he did also partially defend himself.\n\nI showed the messages to my partner, and he's shocked at what Jack said. We both agree that Jack doesn't mean to be insensitive on purpose, but that he keeps putting his foot in his mouth. Jack and I have always had a special friendship where we were like siblings and we've always gone out of our way to help each other, and we know we don't have many best friends. My boyfriend says he'll support me no matter what and he agrees that what Jack has said was bad, but that he knows Jack and I are really close and he'd hate for me to lose someone like that.\n\nI feel like I can't keep putting my mental stability on the line to make some guy feel better about himself. I never try to force people to speak how I want (I always stay quiet and avoid that person if they're one of those fake accusers), but I also am not going to keep hanging out with people who keep making jokes about the worst thing that ever happened to me despite being warned. Jack knows I tried to kill myself years ago because of it.\n\nWe haven't spoken since, and I know he's giving me space. The problem is that he's visiting my hometown soon (already booked tickets) and he'll be visiting all of our coworkers since we used to work together. Our office knows that he and I are really close, and they ask me often about him. I don't want to see him, but if I don't go then they'll ask about it a lot. I also had offered him my boyfriend and I's house as accomodation which was one of the reasons he bought the tickets. I don't want him in my house at all now.\n\nAm I overreacting? Should I stay friends with him? Should I leave him but still give him an explanation as to why I don't want to be friends with him anymore? I'm not trying to ghost him or give him the silent treatment, I just straight up do not want to see him or relive memories of what happened to me. We have never fought over anything else in the past.\n\n**I am aware that I'm going to be told to get a counsellor and I agree with that, but I also want to get opinions on what I should do regarding my relationship with him since he'll be visiting my office soon.**\n\n**TL;DR: After my best friend found out I was raped and that I tried to kill myself over it, he would make horrible jokes about it because he thought I would like them. I had made it clear that I didn't want to be in contact with someone who did that. He has apologized but keeps doing it. I want to cut him out of my life to work on improving myself but I'll be questioned a lot if I do. I will also be forcing him to spend $150-250 because I won't be around to drive/accomodate him for an upcoming trip (but he has a good paying job and can easily afford this).**",

She wouldn't let up with it and acted as if it was some moral tragedy that I was going to have a second beer without buying her one. We don't share finances or anything and money is tight for both of us.\n\nWe kept fighting for the whole night. She pretty much just kept repeating \"How can you be so shameless? To order another big beer for yourself without ordering me a small one! I'm ashamed for you!\". I kept chalking it just a difference of opinion that isn't really a big deal, but she just kept being so over the top about it and drawing conclusions like she thinks I'll restrict finances in marriage (but no way in hell I'm marrying her without her having her own income after this) and talking about how others (friends) have treated her to more things and stuff\n\nI think she's the asshole here because I shouldn't be expected to pay for more than I offered to pay for.

    "selftext": "After having lived away from home for about two years, I'm back in my home town during my summer break from school. Initially my plan was to stay one week with my mom and one week with my dad. However, I have since gotten a full time job and have mostly been staying with my mom as it was ideal that I would drop her off at her train in the morning and drive myself to work. \n\nOn top of the full time job I still have the part time job I had initially gotten for the summer. Living with my mom has created a couple of issues that I am trying to set boundaries for. For example, I don't personally smoke or drink much and am not comfortable buying my mom cigarettes and alcohol as I believe she smokes too much and drinks too much (and gambles online too much). \n\nYesterday, after having worked at my part time job I got a text from my mom asking me to pick her up cigarettes, wine, and a few groceries on my way home. After it took 10 minutes for me to get the convenience store clerk to sell me the right cigarettes (I don't know anything about cigarettes nor about the type she likes), I'd had enough of it. Why was I buying these things I don't approve of after a long day at work, when my mom had the whole day off and lived a 5-8 minute walk from the convenience store. With road closures due to recent flooding and running her errands (in a plaza a 5 minute walk from our house, something she could have done during the 4.5 hours I was at work), it took me nearly an hour and a half to get home. \n\nI told my mom that I wasn't comfortable buying her cigarettes and that I would no longer be doing it, and she did not take it well. Telling me about how she always does things she's not comfortable but *fine*, if I was going to be like that. And how she would have run the errands herself if I hadn't been out with her car all day. So, I suggested that if me driving myself to my part time job on the weekend was such a problem for her, I'd be perfectly fine with her dropping me off at work instead. She told me that she was planning to do that tomorrow (now today) anyways as she had some exchanges to do at the mall.\n\nToday I went downstairs to make some breakfast and get some water before getting ready for work. As I'm doing so my mom asks that if she lets me drive her car would I be willing to go to the mall and do these exchanges for her after work. I was still half asleep and told her \"Oh, no not really. But if you really want me to, I will.\" Since then I've been given the silent treatment, my mom refuses to engage in any of my attempts to talk about things.\n\nBut the reason I don't want to run her errands for her is because I have things I need to do myself. I need to make lunches for the week (because I work full time, like her), do my laundry, walk the dog, clean my room. I'm also planning on staying at my dad's this coming week to get some distance from my mom before I become too bitter about everything.\n\nI feel like an asshole for saying no to my mom, that I will not run all of her errands for her. But I'm working up to 55 hours a week, and she wants me to do these errands so she can sit at home and do nothing on the weekend while I'm working. \n\nEDIT: spelling and grammar.",

We texted over the summer for a bit but every time I tried to schedule a date to hang out, she would say she was busy and she never tried to schedule an alternative time so I assumed she just didn't want to and stopped texting her. She messaged me again when Uni started back up, and we sort-of dated for about a week before she broke up with me. \n\nSince then we've been on-again off-again friends, though only really over text. We hung out for a bit after breaking up, but over Christmas we got into a row and never really starting hanging out again. After end-of-year exams she messaged me again asking to go out for drinks. However, every time I tried to schedule a time she rejected me without suggesting a new one, so I assumed she didn't actually want to. I tried being direct, but she still made no attempt to follow up on her offer to get drinks.\n\nSo I've just stopped texting her. Without telling her why or so much as a goodbye.\n\nI feel awful about it, though. Whenever people do this to me it just tears me apart, but I can't help but feel like telling her would be worse. And I'm afraid I'm just being oversensitive. \n\nI spent high school holed up in my room learning Java, so I know fuck all about navigating social situations. Am I being an asshole?

    "selftext": "So this Saturday is my 18th birthday, and to celebrate I'm going for dinner with my closest group of friends, which consists of 8 people, and going clubbing after. I made an event on Facebook about a month ago, saying the plan was dinner and clubbing, and everyone except one guy said \"going\". Yesterday, one of the guys that had said \"going\" on the event texted me saying he couldn't come clubbing, but would come for dinner and a few drinks afterwards. This guy is one of my best, if not my best friend in the group - I've known him since I was 10. When I asked him why, he said he was going out with some other friends because it's the only night they could all make before everyone went off on holiday for the summer. I said I was looking forward to celebrating with everyone, to which he replied that he was going out with us basically every day next week (which is true), and he wanted one night with his other friends. He then said, I quote, \"lool if you're salty I'll come with you guys thought you wouldn't mind\".\n\nI told him that I was quite disappointed because I considered him a good friend, and regardless of the occasion it's a dick move to commit to something a month before and back out the week of the event, never mind when it's a close friend's 18th. After this he basically said he'd cancel with the other group and come with us. He then tried to make the excuse that he didn't know we were going clubbing and thought it was just dinner, although that doesn't really make sense to me since his first text was saying specifically that he could come to dinner but couldn't come clubbing. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I really do feel like I have some right to be upset, but on the other hand I also kinda feel like I'm forcing this guy to come to something he doesn't want to, which is obviously not my intention.

I honestly believed I had some sort of mental disability as a child.  She said to everyone at my brothers funeral that she wished it was me instead.  This caused me to try and kill myself as I was already destroyed by his death. \n\nFast forward a few years I am considering college, and thinking about working a bit first to get money to do so since my mom said she has no interest in help, and that was fine.  Well my aunt(the matriarch of my mothers side of the family) calls and is upset I am not going to college.  My mothers dad left my mom a great deal of money specifically for me to go to college.  I tell her I did not know about this and she speaks with my mom, and tells me she will kick my mother out of the family if I do not go to college.  So my mother decides she will help me go to college now.\n\nNow during college she called my dad and convinced him to help pay too and he does.  He has always paid more than his fair share of child support and always gave me money.  He was just always distant emotionally.   \n\nIn college my mother contacted my first serious girlfriend and tried to convince her to leave me(she later did this with my current wife).  She has called my employers(at least twice) and made up lies about me to try and get me fired.  I borrowed some money from her and paid her back the amount i borrowed.\n\nNow 5 years after college I tell her my job is going well.  She says that I can now pay her back.  She claims I owe her $40,000  For raising me, paying for my college(my aunt the now has severe dementia), and interest on the loan i borrowed.\n\nI do not trust her to be honest.  I honestly believe she will lie cheat and steal to get anything she can.  She kept bothering me to pay her some form of money as a sign of good faith I will repay the rest.  One of my cousins called me and told me not to pay her because she is planning to use it to take me to court showing I agree that I owe her.  She is not hurting for money.  I know she has a couple million of dollars and multiple homes.  \n\nSo I blocked her on all social media.  I only call her on holidays and try to avoid her altogether.  I feel guilty because she is my mom, but even when I do call her half the time she emotionally bashes me.  I just hate dealing with her.

After about fifteen minutes of this I lose my temper and cuss them out.\n\nSo for context I live in a small town and a majority of the people here are conservative and listen to nothing but country music. I like to read books and listen to music. I listen to Punk Rock and Metal among other genres, so the majority of my shirts reflect that. I often wear shirts from classic rock, punk rock and metal bands. Some examples are: Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Paul McCartney (from when I saw him live), the Doobie Brothers, the Misfits, Ramones, and Black Flag. The only general merchandise store in the whole county is a Walmart in my town. As there is nothing to do a lot of people just hang out there. \n\nSo earlier today my sister and I went to Walmart as she needed pants for her new job. As she walks around doing her thing, I go straight to the book section and see what new books they have. About halfway between the front entrance and the book aisle I noticed that there were about four or five Amish or Mennonite (I don't know the difference between Amish and Mennonite people) people staring at me. I look down at my shirt and realized why they were staring at me. I was wearing my black Misfits shirt with the Horror Business EP cover on it. I just shrugged it off as I am used to getting stared at for stuff like this. \n\nAs I make my way to the book aisle I noticed that they were heading that way. I get there and started looking at Louis L'Amour books when they people walk into the aisle, again I shrugged it off as all people read.  I the finish looking at books then go to the CD section to see if they had a copy of ...And Justice for All by Metallica. I start heading that way and do do these people. Yet again I shrug it off as a coincidence. I get to the last place I saw a copy of that album and they didn't have one. I walk to the five dollar section (Where they had everything from Kill em All to The Black Album without Justice) and pick up a copy of Dookie by Green Day. That's when one lady from the Amish group calls me a vermin or something to that extent.\n\nI kindly ask the lady to repeat herself  and she repeats it. I just ignore that like the staring as I am used to the occasional remarks. Then another one of those ladies started telling me that \"I should have a little decency and not advertise such Satanic bands...\"  After this I asked them politely to leave me alone.  Pretty soon after I ask them to leave me alone they all started to insult me. After five minutes I ask an employee if they could help me out with getting these people away but he wasn't much help... After about ten more minutes of this constant nagging about how I \"am a demon sent to kill small children\" or something ridiculous like that I thought \"I'll show them what a demon is like.\"\n\nI lose my temper and told them to go suck a dick and to find other things to do than harass teenagers in a Walmart among other things with a whole lot more colorful language. \n\nAm I the Asshole for yelling obscenities at them?",

    "selftext": "This just happened about 30 minutes ago. I live in a rural area and I have a large yard with an underground fence for my dog.  Even with her having the underground fence, I still make sure someone is always outside with her, for this exact reason.  When FedEx or USPS deliver a package, they pull in the driveway and wait until I can get the dog inside.  Actually the USPS driver likes to get out and pet the dog so I don't bother calling her inside when USPS arrives.  The problem I have is with UPS.  Most UPS drivers will pull in the driveway but some refuse.  I have no idea why, the driveway is HUGE with plenty of space to turn around in, but for whatever reason they will stop in the middle of the road with their hazard lights on and walk up the driveway.  Well one particular driver likes to walk up the steep 15' bank down the road from my driveway and walk around the back of the house to deliver packages onto my side porch.  He's done this at least 4 different times that I can remember.  Today he decided to do that and my dog and kids were outside.  As he's walking around the house, my dog sees him and runs up to him and starts barking like a freaking lunatic, trying to stay between the deliver guy and my kids.  So the delivery guy starts hitting her with the box and screaming and cursing as loud as he can.  This made my dog completely insane and she wouldn't obey my commands.  I had to physically pull her away.  She did not jump, bite, or attempt to bite.  She has never bitten anyone and is mostly just excited to see who's here when a car pulls in the driveway.  She isn't normally like this and I think it's just because this driver basically snuck up on her.   \n\nAm I an asshole for not being able to control my dog in this situation, or is the driver an asshole for taking a detour to my porch?",

All I ask is that whatever is dirty goes into the laundry hamper.

So I stopped washing anything that wasn't in the hamper.

We started hooking up and we were moving towards being exclusive. I was never 100% there but she was so I decided to go for it.\n\nThroughout the relationship I've always had a wandering eye; naturally because I am so young. A lot of nights thinking what my life would be like with another girl. \n\n*Fast forward to 2016* \n\n\nI got fed up with the feeling eating at my insides and broke it off with my girlfriend. Destroyed our friend group (she slept with my best friend)\n\nMind you, she is a fantastic girl aside from the above. Sought after by a lot of guys. She's intelligent, loving, great motherly instincts. What a lot of guys would consider \"wife\" material. Sometimes I think she's everything I want in a girl (minus looks somewhat).\n\nWe got back together a few months later because I'm a ***** and was getting depressed.

    "selftext": "Hello! I'm feeling like an asshole here, and would like an outside opinion.\n\nI met this guy online. We've been on 4 dates over the past 3 weeks. He's lovely and we get along great, share a lot of the same interests, and have very similar beliefs. We're both 21/22.\n\nOn my profile, I stated that I'm looking for someone within 100 miles, that ideally I'm looking for a long term relationship, and that I'd like to take things slow. All of this was discussed and agreed upon before we even met. We both are looking for those same three things. We also both agree that \"long term\" is something longer than a year.\n\nCurrently, we live approximately 45 minutes from one another. Being close to each other is important for him, and I would agree, but not to the same extent. Quality time is important to him, and this 45 minute drive isn't bad for me at all. He lives close to some of my extended family so I happen to be in or near his town fairly often, so it seemed to work out.\n\nToday, he tells me that he plans on transferring to another college in about a year, which happens to be a little over 3 hours away, and *much* more than 100 miles. I wasn't sure how to respond, so we just talked about how great of an opportunity that this is, how he'll further his education, etc. \n\nThe more I think about it, the less I like it. One year *is* a while, enough to know if we're compatible in the long term or not. If we aren't compatible long term, no harm, no foul. We're young, we can move on and find other people. However, I fear that if we *do* find ourselves together 11 months from now, I won't be comfortable with long distance. In my current situation, I would be unable to make that drive, and I wouldn't expect him to while going to school there. He wouldn't get the quality time that he desires, and I fear that we will grow to resent each other. Long distance isn't for me, which I discussed as my reasoning for \"within 100 miles.\" \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for not wanting to continue seeing him? I haven't said anything to him about this yet, because I've been trying to collect my thoughts on the matter. It almost feels like there's an \"expiration date\" for us dating.",

    "selftext": "We had new neighbors move in on the right hand side of us(if you're facing the street) about a month and a half ago. A young couple (somewhere between 26-31) and their two young boys (ages 4-6), plus 3 dogs.\n\nWe live in a quiet part of town, the houses are modestly priced for their size and sit on tree-lined streets, both a high school and an elementary school are within walking distance, kids ride their bikes down the sidewalks(it is not safe to ride them in the street, we sometimes have speeders) and play in their front yards without fear of unsavory characters or flying bullets, the metro station is within walking distance, there's a park also within walking distance; its the perfect type of place to start and grow your family.\n\nAfter talking to them, I learned they came from a gated manufactured home(see also: mobile home) community (coincidentally, the same one my ex just moved into, so I know it well.); where they come from security patrols regularly, kids play outside in the street, and the speed limit within the community is a strict no-nonsense 10 MPH(you WILL get caught, you WILL receive a ticket), the  lots are about 3 feet apart so if you so much as SNEEZE your neighbor knows about it, and there's absolutely no parking on the street. \n\nTheir old community was basically the real life equivalent of a \"tutorial level\" for a life simulator game. \n\nWhen they first moved in, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. It's very easy to hear what's going on over there because they don't have very much furniture, and nothing on the walls. The adult male has an older model mustang in bright red. As a car girl, I was impressed, until I heard him start it and realized he'd taken the muffler off. On purpose. **Strike one.**\n\nThen, one day I'm coming home from work (around 8 pm, so it was starting to get dark), their moving van is parked in front of the house. I park my car, and I'm sitting in my car, with it turned off and scrolling through my phone when out of the corner of my eye the cab of this moving truck lights up, the passenger side door opens and a child no older than 4-5 clumsily climbs down out of the cab of the truck, he stands in the street for a couple minutes (door still wide open. We occasionally have speeders down my block, no kid is safe in the street) and looks down the street, and then at me sitting in my car. He has a pacifier(binky, dummy, whatever you like) in his mouth and he's chewing on it. He then walks around the door, and pushes it closed with all his might(but it doesn't close, and the light in the cab stays on), he walks up the driveway of his new house, and disappears around the back of the house. Its then that I see his older brother(6-7) is sitting in the cab of the truck, in the driver seat, pretending to drive. He gets in and out of the truck several times running around  in the street, to the passenger side of the truck, climbing into the truck, climbing across to the driver side, then doing it all over again. Eventually the older boy goes inside too, and the moving truck sits there, cab lights on, both doors slightly ajar. I wait; thinking someone is going to come close the doors(surely people know where there kids have been?), it stays on all the way after I shower and change my clothes and I am heading out for the night with friends. I walk over, close the doors, and make sure the interior light turns off, get in my car and leave. Letting your young children play inside of a truck and in the street unsupervised? **Strike two.**\n\nThe next morning, I'm awoken a few minutes before my alarm to a man SCREAMING in obvious rage; his voice is low, guttural, and dare I say scary, I've never heard a man talk to ANYONE that way (my own father is rather soft spoken, and so are a lot of men in my life), he's yelling at someone to \"just leave it the fuck alone, stop touching it\", and when I hear the answering cries of a small child, I peek out the window in our kitchen and see him wailing on the youngest boy with a closed fist. There's an open moving box on the driveway near them, and some foam puzzle pieces (the big toy ones, for the floor) are strewn about. I'm a little shocked, and part of me *knows* that he shouldn't be hitting his child that way. But, I am not a parent, and don't feel it's my place to say anything. I have to leave for work, so idk what the conclusion of this particular incident is. Beat your kids in the driveway for just being kids? **Strike three.**\n\nOver the past couple of weeks there's been more incidents such as these, and other incidents as well. \n\n- Screaming matches between parents (\"Are you really going to sit on your ass and not bring up the laundry so I can fold it?!\" -a presumed loving wife to her lovely husband). I had a friend over and we were sitting on my front porch just talking, and the screaming was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk.\n- I thought it was a little weird that they left all their lights on, and left the doors open and the A/C on, but figured that they knew what they were doing. They got their electric bill after a month of living there, and Dear Old Dad almost had a coronary. At their old community the way their electric bill was calculated was that the whole park got charged one fee(by the electric company), and it was devided by the number of lots that were occupied at the time, meaning it wasn't unheard of for a family of 4-5 to have 45$ electric bill no matter how much they blasted the A/C, or left lights on. It's not like that out here in the real world, where your electricity is your responsibility. \n- The male counterpart getting in his (NOISY)mustang and peeling out of the driveway doing 45 to \"cool down\" after every argument. Considering there's a fight at least twice a day....\n- the children misbehaving within the home and getting screamed at/punished. Seriously, I always know when they are sitting down to eat dinner because it's always a screaming match between the parents and the kids, with plenty of threats, swearing, and punishment. These kids can never escape the table without an ass whooping.)\n- the dogs barking for some unknown reason (not a problem with me, we have a rottweiler, he barks too), and both adults full blown screaming at, and hitting all three dogs to the point that the dogs are crying/coweri away from them. \n- the older boy has some sort of anger issue (I wonder where he learned that from), and if he gets frustrated at all or doesn't get his way, a screaming match will ensue.  Just wordless, seemingly endless, piercing yells because he cannot think of any other way to relieve his stress other than screaming. \n\nToday, I don't work until 4pm, so I've been home all day. During lunch, I heard what I thought was another screaming match between the boys break out next door, and then heard the father laughing. While cleaning the kitchen, I listened to what was being said (oh, this is also not hard to do because since getting their electric bill, they now leave every window open instead of using The A/C. If I stand in my kitchen, I can hear the dad's Pandora playing on his cell phone. I am privy to every. Single. Conversation. that happens within that house, whether I want to hear it or not.), and the dad had a toy the older boy wanted. The dad was playing the \"up high, down low, too slow\" high-five game, and if the older boy could hit his hands, he could have the toy. Clearly an adult is going to win this game every time, and every time the boy lost, he would let out a scream that could wake 3 centuries worth of dead folks, getting louder and louder as his frustration grew. Eventually, the boy was crying in frustration, and his dad was just laughing his ass off, loudly. Probably the only time I've ever heard the guy laugh. While not abusive, still he's being a fucking dick, and the kid's screaming had my anxious (and old) rottweiler pacing back and forth and panting. \n\n**TL;DR: my new neighbors are trailer trash, the father beats both his kids and all three of his dogs. His wife is a giant cunt who never watches the kids and let's them play in the street. There's constant screaming matches that have disrupted my sleep, and caused friends to look at me like \"wtf is going on over there?\" The constant screaming is making my own dogs anxious. Would it make me an asshole to file a noise complaint?**",

I feel his uncle is enabling him too by never saying anything so it's like it's up to me to say something and it'll prob not accomplish anything either bc the baby thing is a good reason and I feel like I'll sound like an asshole confronting him about him exaggerating his role in watching his kid despite it seeming pretty obvious that he is.  \n\nSo would I be an asshole to present my pov and belief that he's just lazily exploiting his position &amp; making my job harder?

So today, I was looking at the selection of Macbook Pros at Best Buy when this small, cute girl who had the blue best buy shirt came up to me and asked me what I was looking for. I really knew what I wanted in my mind, and as a tech nerd, I knew everything about the MBPs, but just to politely engage her, I told her I was interested in the MBP 15. \n\nShe started talking about all the features it had, and when she finished I told her, \"Thank you very much. If I think I'll buy today, I'll for sure call you over\" (cause I get that they receive a comission). I was sure that implicit in my response was a notice that I didn't need her assistance any longer. She replied by thanking me, but then she continued to talk about how the new MBP is different from the previous gen for like 2/3 minutes. I then told her, \"Alright, I understand, thanks again\" before walking away to the windows PCs. \n\nThe bitch (sorry) followed me there and began to trash talk the HP Spectre I was looking, at which point I purposefully began to break eye contact with her and just focused solely on the computer. Whenever she would finish talking, I would reply with \"cool\" just to emphasize that I was trying to distance myself. \n\nBut holy shit she wouldn't stop talking and following me around, at which point I told her, \"Look, I thought I was making this clear. Thank you, but I don't require your assistance anymore.\" She looked fucking mortified when I said that, and I swear she was gonna tear up. There were two guys and a family of four in the area around me, and they all heard me. You should've seen the look on their faces as I said that to this girl. One of the guys shook his head and said, \"You dick.\" \n\nI attempted to defend myself (which I now regret) by saying, \"No, I really appreciate the information she's given me, it's just I don't need her anymore for my shopping.\" The other dude, who I presume was friends with the guy who called me a dick, said, \"Yeah, you should apologize, asshole.\" I didn't want any trouble as a weak, skinny guy, so I tried to sincerely apologize and said, \"Hey, look, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I was just done with you at the moment\" (horrible wording, I know, but I was flustered at that point). The best buy girl just slowly walked away, shoulders slumped. First dude said, \"Fucking asshole!\" and walked away with the second dude. The mom in the family of four shook her head and walked away with the rest of the family. \n\nLook, I don't think of myself as an asshole, it's just that she was being really annoying and pushy as a salesman. I even promised to call her over if I decided to purchase the MBP, but I was trying to politely make it clear that I didn't need her anymore. Honestly, I think the people surrounding me only felt bad for her because she was petite and pretty. I swear to god if she were a normal looking guy no one would've batted an eye. \n\n\n",

Laura eventually tells me that I am her best friend. I am dealing with my own isolation and major depression, but Laura helps me manage it by supporting me like nobody else in my life ever has. Last winter, Laura tells me that her relationship with Greg has fallen apart. They barely speak and she's sleeping on the couch, the only reason she's still there is that of her cats and that she can't afford her own place. Before the holidays, Laura tells me that she loves me. She goes on a trip back home for Christmas, tells me about plans for possibly getting a promotion at work and moving, or just going back home for good. After she returns, she starts to go downhill emotionally. Greg knows what's going on, knows we're talking, and monitors her devices. In March, after telling me that she will call me the next day, Laura ghosts me completely, offering no warning or explanation. I contact her mother through Facebook and find out she's safe, but that's it. And that's where the last post ended.\n\nIt has been a real rollercoaster since then. I moved, started a new job, and began therapy. I went completely all-in with socialising, going out every night to meet people, see shows, anything and everything I could find that might distract me. As a dedicated introvert, that was difficult and exhausting for me, but it almost seemed to be working. I had honest moments where I thought things were getting better.\n\nMeanwhile, I was in semi-regular contact with Laura's mother. Right after Laura ghosted me, I sent her a gift (careful to make sure it went to her work and not her apartment so that Greg wouldn't find it). Just something I saw her like on Facebook because at the time I had no idea what was going on, thought maybe she was just mad at me for something, or thought I was mad at her. Whatever it was, I did it to provoke a response and I did get one.\n\nThe day after I got my email notice saying the package had arrived, Laura contacted me to say she got the gift and liked it. That she was sorry and that she had to go.\n\nI should explain again that Laura had broken off contact before, and even when we were still chatting regularly through Skype. Some days she just couldn't muster the will to say anything. Usually, I'd keep chatting at her, trying to encourage her, tell her about my day, that sort of thing, and she would come back and say that she liked it when I did that whether she said anything back or not.\n\nThat was the mindset I still had after she contacted me about the gift. I'd just about given up on things but after that, I renewed my efforts to be there in some capacity. I realize this is going to seem real dumb and rather pathetic, but it is what it is. She was my best friend and I simply had nobody else to talk to. So I would write through Skype whenever I had extra time (she never actually logged off, just went AFK), and every weekend I would send her an email. I hoped that she could see the good that she was still doing for me, or that anything might get her to say something. Yeah, there were bad days, too, but I don't think I was ever mean even when I second-guessed myself. And I was also a bit careful about what I said because--as Laura's mother explained herself--we all knew Greg was probably monitoring and that was the reason she stopped in the first place.\n\nAfter a bit of this, still with zero response though I could see that she was around, I got the bright idea of sending a letter. I couldn't mail it directly because Greg would know my address, but I talked to Laura's mother and she agreed to forward it for me in one of her regular care packages. So I set about putting my heart and soul into it, trying to say everything I hadn't before, sealed it up and sent it off. I couldn't get stamps for a return letter, but I wrote that she could just pick up a postcard on the way to work and send me ANYTHING, even if it was just \"Fuck off and die.\"\n\nTime passes, Laura's mother gets the letter. I'm feeling okay again with my little plan. Chatting more with Laura's mother, and I'm pretty sure she knows what's going on, too, though neither of us says anything. But she's not telling me off, either, so I'm encouraged.\n\nOne day, I make a random comment on a Facebook post and Laura's mother immediately messages me. She says that she had the letter all boxed up and ready to go, but Laura found out and asked her to send it back to me without opening it. And that she'd decided to try and work things out with Greg. \"I'm so sorry,\" said Laura's mother. I'm just glad I wasn't working that day because I did not deal with it well despite having suspected that would happen anyway.\n\nThe worst part of it for me at the time was that she never once said anything to me directly and I couldn't understand why. Was she afraid I'd get mad at her, try to hurt her? And if I was what both her and Greg wanted, then what would it matter if he knew she was telling me to bug off? Was she trying to hurt me on purpose? Because this was basically the worst way to go about things and she KNEW that I was still waiting. As I said, we'd both discussed it before the ghosting.\n\nUnable to sleep, I did what is probably the wrong thing and wrote both an email and a social media post expressing that sentiment. More as well, and I'm sure I went over the line. I just thought that if we'd been friends at all she owed me at least an explanation to my face. I'm sure you know most of what goes through a person's head in that situation.\n\nI'll say that I wasn't sure whether she was getting any of my emails at the time. For all I knew, she'd blocked me weeks ago. And I deleted the social media post the next day.\n\nThat done, and after leaving a softer goodbye with her mother, I figured I'd done everything I could and there was a heartbeat or two where I could see the other side.\n\nAnd then Laura contacted me again.\n\n\"The last few months have been the darkest period of my entire life.\"\n\n\"I saw what you wrote. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Talking to you is too hard. I just wish we could be friends. I just want to be alone now.\"\n\nThat's nothing like what I expected and any bit of anger I'd had turned instantly into concern.\n\nShe asked me not to email her about it and so I didn't. The last thing I wanted to do was make things worse, because it keeps going downhill from there.\n\nOver time, with her initiating all the short contact, she explained that her promotion at work fell through so badly that she lost the only friend she'd thought she had there. (\"It would be better if they'd just fired me.\") That she no longer wanted to go home because she considered herself too much of a burden for her own family (She'd just learned that someone there was sick, but it's only diabetes and her mother assures me there's nothing close to life threatening going on. But for Laura, it's coming all at once, so I get it.), that she wanted to completely give up on everything else, and that she was even having thoughts of suicide. (\"The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself is that I'd miss my cats.\")\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure what to make of that, either. It felt so unreal. The next day, I reported everything to Laura's mother, including a log of the brief chat. I asked if Laura had ever been suicidal before and her mother said that, yes, she had, and promised that they would step in before it got that bad. Yet, everything I said was news to her and Laura told me that if she were ever going to do it she wouldn't tell anyone, her mother and me included. Her mother wanted to know if she was being abused. I could have said yes but I didn't think Greg was like that. \"We just want her to come back home.\"\n\nI kept my promise about not contacting Laura directly but I stayed up every single night till 3 am (to account for the time difference) to be available in case she had anything else to say. I tried to explain that you can't just stop caring about someone no matter how many times she told me I should move on and forget about her. And what do you do when your best friend tells you that she's been thinking about those sorts of things?\n\nThe method she used to contact me was incredibly awkward but also left no trace, which is why she used it. At one point, someone I met suggested WhatsApp as a possible Skype alternative that lets you erase your message log. When I brought that up to Laura, her response was, \"What would I even talk about? How much I wish I were dead?\"\n\nThings fell into a bit of a routine again. Every night or two, she'd come around, usually not for very long, but it was enough to see her and know she was there. She told me a few more things. I never asked about Greg because I was too scared, but if they were working things out for real then I didn't think she'd be worse off than ever before, right? That doesn't make any sense. I reported whatever I learned to her mother who talked more and more about wanting her to at least visit. We both agreed getting her into an environment where people cared would make all the difference.\n\nMeanwhile, I'd started to neglect other aspects of my life. The constant, niggling worry and lack of sleep interfered with work and being home every night to wait up for her put a damper on my small social life. I didn't care.\n\nShe cracked a joke. She said I made her smile. I thought things were happening.\n\nThen it all stopped again. No warning, no explanation. It has been two weeks, more or less, without a word and I'm back at square one. But I see her there and I can't say anything. I see her there and I start to feel like an asshole stalker because I'm invested and I just don't know what's going through her head. Nor do I know what will happen tomorrow.\n\nI understand that she says talking to me is difficult, that she thinks she hurt me and regrets that. But even without the love aspect, she was my best friend and she changed my life. She was the one person who every made me feel like I was good enough and now it's as if she's saying that when it really comes down to it, I'm not. And I don't know how to express any of this without it seeming like I'm blaming her for something because I'm not. It's only that which keeps this sort of post anonymous right now. I know it hurt her last time and the thought of making things worse for her. Yet, I can't sit on my feelings and let them poison me again from the inside. An hour of therapy a week is not enough when I can barely get into this after we've caught up with the rest of my life's mess.\n\nLaura's mother has been on vacation for the last week and I left her out of it. Then it's July 4th. After that, my only plan is to tell her everything, start to finish, if she'll hear me out. If it can help, I'll look as bad as I have to. Maybe things have improved, maybe Laura doesn't need me anymore. There are some vague plans for her to visit her mother again later in the year and it could be that's when she finally tells me what's going on. Or maybe not.\n\nIs it too much to ask for some closure?\n\nIf you made it this far, I apologize for putting you through that. I'm sure there are other, more fitting places to put this sort of thing and if I had friends right now I trusted to talk to about it, I would. The last person I opened up to about this ghosted me, too, and I can hardly blame her. So, you know. But seeing Laura there nearly every day, having so much I want to say and holding back and always wondering why, going through those loops of reasons as I attempt to fathom what's going on in someone else's head--it's too much. And my own head, too. What if I'm holding on beyond all reason because it's all I have? There were moments, even days, after she contacted me again where I felt like giving up myself, throwing away what progress I'd made and maybe just going back to the cult I'd left. I wouldn't believe any of it, but I know how to fake it and at least I'd have people around who gave a shit.\n\nI really do feel like an asshole about this and if venting on the internet is the best I've got, well, catharsis is catharsis at this point and I'll take what I can get.

The wife decides to stop in a 'T' intersection of the parking lot halting any possible traffic from 3 directions. I ask her to pull forward so I can unload the kids better and not have to worry about cars that might come from in front of us or behind us (the way we came in), let alone from the passenger side. I cede my end of the point/argument, swallow my pride and get out to get the first child, then as I'm unloading my 2nd child out of the car, a car tried to exit facing us from the front. She then aggressively tells me to hurry up so she can let the car out. (My original point was realized and validated).  I continue getting the second (non walking) child out. I grab the hand of the first one to go to the building. \n\nAn older man whom I don't know, is behind me by about 10 meters, as I get buzzed in, I hold the door open long enough so he can get to the door before it closes and locks since it takes about 5-10 seconds for the door to close (because of the thingie that slows doors down) all while keeping an eye on the older kid (only 2 but as tall as most 5 year olds) because I know she will press any buttons in the elevator she can reach. By the time the elevator opens for me (and my kids) he is in the building and right next to me, we get on the elevator. The front door had NOT closed YET. Only later I discovered that my wife was behind the old man AND SHE THINKS I CLOSED THE DOOR ON HER ON PURPOSE. She didn't even see the older man somehow. She only noticed me before she looked for her purse (I assume that's why/how she didn't see him) plus I thought she was staying in the car.  \n\nNow she doesn't wanna go to anywhere. This is THE ONE THING ALL YEAR (so far), I WANTED US TO GO TO. \nIn the interest of trying to keep this as fair as possible, I won't mention HOW other times, she seemingly sabotaged other trips I wanted to go on, just know that things like this have happened before.

    "selftext": "My girlfriend and I live in an apartment, and sometimes our next door neighbors play music very loudly. Sometimes, it's loud enough that the wall vibrates, and other times it's not quite that loud but still very audible. They haven't played music during quiet hours (10 pm to 7 am), which I'm thankful for. They also seem to play the music in 10 second intervals. So it's not a constant stream of music, but those few seconds occur unpredictability and the music is intense/loud. I don't know why they do this, but felt that it was important to note for context.\n\nTo be honest, the music really irritates me. It has woken us up around 8:30 am on a few occasions. It's hard to relax after work around, say, 7 pm when I'm anticipating the next burst of music. We've lived here for two years and haven't had this particular issue with any of our previous three neighbors here.\n\nI don't want to ask them to stop playing their music altogether. I just don't think that I should have to hear their music, regardless of whether it's quiet hours or not. I want to go over there, introduce myself, explain the issue, and politely ask them to lower the music's volume. Another redditor said that I'd be asking for a huge favor by doing this and should even bring them cookies or beer for honoring the request... I'm inclined to view it as a common courtesy.

I don't exactly have great social skills, so please help me. While I don't really get in major arguments that often with people, I do get into somewhat trivial arguments with my close friends and family at least once a month, and a common aspect of those arguments is that I'll continue to argue if they backpedal, unless they also give a good apology.  I'll give a specific example that happened a couple days ago. I'll do my best to be as accurate as possible, but I don't think the quotes that I'll give are 100% verbatim. I think they're close, though.\n\nMy boyfriend and I, who both play a lot of video games, were talking about video games over the phone. We talked about Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I had mistakenly thought that my boyfriend had played it before, and he corrected me, telling me that he played it for only an hour before stopping. He likes the series, but he didn't like Dragon Age II much, which discouraged him from continuing the series. I like the entire series quite a lot.\n\nAfter that, we moved on to talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, which is one of his favorite games, and I'm looking forward to playing it someday. He talked for a while about everything that he loves about it, and at one point, he said, \"Oh yeah, the reason that I stopped playing Inquisition is because Xenoblade Chronicles does it better.\" It wasn't clear what \"it\" was, but I think he was referring to the sidequest system and the gameplay.  I don't know much about Xenoblade Chronicles, so I don't really have an opinion on that, but I actually don't especially like the gameplay in Inquisition either.\n\nBased on his tone and his words, I found what he said to be a bit dismissive about a game that I really like, and while I tried to let it go at first, I ultimately decided to tell him that that was a rude thing to say about a game that I like, and I went on to say that that is a foolish reason to not give a game more of a chance, especially when that game was pretty well-received and many of his friends like the game. While I tried to say that calmly, I'm sure I sounded a bit irritated.\n\nHe, also sounding irritated, responded that it wasn't dismissive or rude because he also likes Dragon Age (the first game, anyway) and he intends on playing Inquisition someday, too. He also said that he was praising Xenoblade Chronicles and not insulting Inquisition. \n\nThis is the part where I think I was an asshole. I told him that he was insulting Inquisition because of the way he phrased it and because he gave it as a reason for why he stopped playing after an hour.  We then got into an argument about what he originally said, and after a minute or so, when it was clear that this wasn't going to be resolved with a \"Sorry, I was rude,\" I said, \"I'm willing to drop this, if you want. I don't think there's any point in continuing to argue about this.\" He was very quiet for a minute, and when I asked if he was okay, he said, in a forced calm voice, that he was sorry for being rude and dismissive and that he didn't want to talk any more tonight. \"Good night.\"\n\nTo be honest, I actually wasn't that upset about the conversation anymore and more worried about him, which is why I decided to ask about my behavior on here.  We have since apologized to each other, and he even sent me a gift on Steam (because of the Summer Sale) to apologize, though I actually feel uncomfortable when I receive apology gifts, especially when I consider myself to also be at fault.  I thanked him for it, though, of course.\n\nSo, in those types of arguments, where I argue with someone when they backpedal and they try to say that they didn't say/mean to say that when I believe they did say/mean to say that, am I an asshole? I think I was, at least a little bit, because what if he was telling the truth? I think for him, regardless of what he actually said, it probably was the truth.  On the other hand, I've backpedaled before, and I remember a few times in high school where I tried to lie and pretend that I didn't say what I know I said.  Either way, assuming that I know someone's thoughts is rude, too, right?\n\nWhat would a kind person do, in my shoes? Accept their not-apology? Explain my point-of-view, let them tell me theirs, and drop it? Don't bring it up in the first place? \n\nTL;DR: Am I an asshole for arguing when someone tries to take back what they say? Specific example: Boyfriend and I got into an argument about video games. He said something dismissive about a game that I really like. I said that what he said was rude. He said he didn't mean to insult the game. I said he did mean to insult the game. Am I the asshole in that situation for not dropping the argument after he said that he didn't mean to insult the game?\n\nEdit: Typos.\n\nEdit: Thanks for your replies and your verdicts, everyone. And an even bigger thank you to those who went out of their way to explain their perspective. I apologized to my boyfriend again, and he took it very well and doesn't seem to hold any negative feelings regarding our argument. As for my question about arguing when someone qualifies or takes back what they said, the consensus is not to do it when it's a trivial argument, I think? And also to believe the person when they're qualifying what they're saying. I'll try to do that. I probably won't respond anymore because I need to focus on other stuff and I'm not sure that anything new will be said.",

    "selftext": "Sorry for the wall of text. All of what is listed below happened over a year ago, I just find myself thinking about this person from time to time and would like some perspective. Thank you.  \n  \nThroughout my college years I was fortunate to spend my summers at working a prominent local resort/landmark. It was unique in that it is located on a fairly small island with a tight knit community that\u2019s population over triples in size over the summer do to tourist demand. A lot of the larger resorts and businesses on the island had something of a tradition of hiring overseas students on work visas for the busy season. For me, as a traveler, it was a great way to meet some excellent people from around the world. When I was 22, my 3rd consecutive summer working at this island, I met a brother (Ahmed 23) and sister (21 Zahra) from a middle eastern country and we became fast friends. I won\u2019t list much detail about that summer, but the important detail is that we became close enough that when they went back to their home country at the end of summer, they pleaded with me to come visit and stay in their home as well as tour me around the landmarks of their wonderful country. I went for 3 wks in January that year and had a truly magnificent time, meeting friends &amp; family, eating local food and going out at night. I really felt blessed to have made these friends I got along with so well.  \n  \nWhen the next summer came around, Ahmed did not a work visa to come back to the island but Zahra did. The job she was to work provided employee housing, but I was tasked by her brother and parents to keep an eye on her. Which of course was no issue, Zahra and I got along like 2 peas in a pod. We had the same sense of humor, liked many of the same hobbies and so on. It\u2019s worth noting here, that well she was absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, I knew that we would certainly never have an intimate relationship due to her Muslim background, which her family took extremely seriously. She never said it directly but it was understood she could only date Muslim men.  \n  \nThat summer was so much fun, mostly because of her. I had been given a promotion prior to the busy season starting and was now a restaurant manager working roughly 70 hrs a week. She was working multiple jobs to save money for her schooling and to help with transport between jobs, I let her use my new Scooter (doesn\u2019t require motorcycle license) all summer long, as I had my own car as well. We were practically attached at the hip if we were not working. We\u2019d squeeze in meals between shifts, either going to one of the excellent local restaurants or cooking for each other. We\u2019d play cards with friends or go to parties on the rare nights we had off. A cpl of times during the summer we were able to go off island (no easy task during that season) to go shopping or to introduce her to family and friends (always made clear we were friends, not dating).  \n  \nZahra\u2019s bday was late in the summer and she had confided in me for her birthday she would love to go to an American football game. I\u2019m a fan, and try to go to one game a year if possible so I got us tickets (Over $150 each) along with one or two other gifts to help make her birthday feel special being away from her family and friends from home. She also wanted to plan a trip for the two of us to go to NYC for a few days before she left to go back to her home country. So I had aligned the football game with the dates she had given me, so essentially we\u2019d have 4 or 5 days of fun together before she returned home. I was able to use some air miles of my dad\u2019s to get the tickets to NYC at a heavily discounted rate.  \n  \nThis all came crashing down, in early September when Zahra received news from her university that would not allow her to enroll if she returned in late September as she had been planning for months. Unbeknownst to me, she was planning on going to school approx. 3 wks after the semester started. So naturally this meant all our plans were off the table and she had to go home in 4 days. She was upset, I was bummed too but I reassured her time and time again that it was ok, and an honest mistake. We\u2019d find other time to hang out and who knows maybe try to meetup in Europe for a vacation over the winter.  \n  \nSo with just a cpl days left to hangout, I had every intention of spending as much time as possible with her, Zahra was now one of my very best friends. But she was different. I left work early to take her to dinner, she said she wasn\u2019t feeling well, but when I returned a cpl hrs later with tea, her roommate said she had left with one her other friends. The next day she had said she wanted to go to our favorite place for lunch, but again when I arrived she had changed her mind and wasn\u2019t hungry and would rather take a nap. She wanted to play cards for her last night with everyone. Not only myself, but about 5 or 6 other employees of the same business (different depts) moved schedules around to play with her. Again, when I went to pick her up (as stated before, playing cards was %100 her idea, and scheduled by her at another friend\u2019s house), she wanted to cook dinner with a girl she had only spent time with 1 or 2 times over the summer (and someone she repeatedly spoke poorly of, she wasn\u2019t close with this girl at all). I was bummed again, but we played without her. It did rub a lot of those guys and girls the wrong way too, as they had shifted schedules to see her.  \n  \nThe next day, she was leaving, I got a half-hearted hug and a \u201cwe\u2019ll keep in touch\u201d. She left my scooter keys with someone less than trustworthy, which pissed me off, though luckily nothing bad happened.  \n  \nAfter Zahra left, I missed her tremendously but felt that things had largely run their course. She messaged me about 2 months later, but not to talk or catch-up, but because she wanted advice on some homework. I helped her, then that night, I just felt used. I truly valued her as a close friend, but then in a moment of clarity, it seemed like I had fallen into a pattern of giving and her just the opposite. Or if not that, perhaps I had done something to make her change her mind about me, which resulted in the cold treatment. So I decided to ghost her, and stop replying to all contact. Its been over a year, she still sends messages from time to time, after almost a full year, she acknowledged some of the things listed above that hurt my feelings. I\u2019m just curious if I did the right thing, she pops up in my head occasionally, a funny memory or inside joke and I really miss her, but largely feel its for the best. She has returned to the island, but I have a new job in a different city, though not too far. Now that I work a normal 9-5 schedule, I often contemplate going out there, but anxiety of being confronted after ghosting her does set in, and I\u2019m normally not an anxious person at all. I guess I'm asking, am I an asshole here? I've noticed recently that I can be very stubborn like my father and I guess I just want some perspective. Thanks  \n  \n**TL;DR - Met a foreign girl, and fast became best friends. Decided to ghost her after plans fell through and she became indifferent/cold towards me.\"\"",

(I managed to pick up some but it's mostly basic and non-conversational.)\n\nA friend and I were talking today over lunch in English, along with two others. I excitedly said that I managed to talk with someone on the phone in the local language. A friend on the table then said something along the lines of \"well, it's not really much of an achievement since you've been here for two years now\". I didn't like this comment but tried to be light about it and said something like sure, but it's really difficult for me -- and that's true. And perhaps I haven't been really making a gallant effort in learning it. But then she kept on making examples of other people who managed to do so. I tried to take all of it as jabs or jokes and it kept going on.\n\nIt came to a point where I felt that it was less of encouragement and more putting me down for not being able to get a hang of the local language because of how she kept on about other people managing to get a hang of it in a shorter period of time. I never heightened my voice but it was clear that I was upset when I said something along the lines of \"a little encouragement would have been great\" and \"i kinda feel bad now from what you're saying\". She said something along the lines of okay, then we don't have to talk about this.\n\nAfter that, the table went quiet until the end of the meal. No one started a conversation after that happened and it felt awkward and I feel that it was somehow my fault.\n\nAfterwards, I talked to her and she claimed that she was just trying to encourage me by giving the examples and she didn't appreciate that I allegedly painted her as the villain. She wouldn't admit that what she did might have been construed as discouragement. (Is it?) In fact, she said something along the lines of: \"I tried to make it clear that it was encouragement in the middle of the meal then you reacted like I was the bad guy\". However, I don't remember any of it. She might be telling the truth for all I know. Who knows.\n\nAnyway, we are friends and we talked about it. In the end it's just been some misunderstanding. She took offense because she felt I was painting her as the bad guy (and that's why she tried to stop the conversation), and I took offense because I felt she was making fun of me / implying I was inadequate for not being able to learn the local language as quickly.\n\nAm I the asshole for making the lunch awkward? And, for the next time something like this happens: Was I too sensitive? Were my reactions valid?",

He has a sponsor and is a sponsor himself to about 4 people.\n\nYesterday my SO came home from work after having a couple beers with a friend. I found an empty beer bottle in his lunch box and threw it away. No issues.

I also give him a certain time where if he doesn't contact me I'll go apeshit and start calling his family to find out where he is. I have told him he is under no circumstances to tell her our address, that we will not accept furniture from her (we're furnishing our apartment and she has a fair amount in storage) so she can't ever say we \"owe her\". I've also told him, if we ever had kids, his mom may not be in their life at all, supervised visits *maybe* when they're older.\n\nContext is this: his mom is abusive, and he's stuck in the victim mentality of hoping she'll change. She has physically abused him (once threw a brick at him, threatened to hit him in the dick with her high heel, punched him in the face, and even defended my boyfriend's brother when he pushed my boyfriend down the stairs). She has financially abused him and ruined his education by forcing him to model from the age of 7 to 11, which he missed on average a day or two of school a week to do, and he only ever saw $400 dollars of what we estimate amounted to thousands if not tens of thousands. He missed so much school his friend thought he was dying. She was severely mentally ill at a point (delusional parasitosis) which made the abuse get worse, even though my boyfriend was essentially her only caretaker and essentially parented his little brother (yep, same one who pushed him down the stairs). She has also disowned him multiple times and said heinous, awful things to him. She even once tore into me, called me a bitch and a slut, because we wouldn't do what she wanted. His parents went through a terrible divorce and continue to use their adult children to antagonize each other.\n\nI grew up in a really good family and my parents consider him part of our family. He has friends he hangs out with, he loves his brother (whom I'm a tad more forgiving for since his multiple concussions apparently caused him rage issues but I'll still never forgive him for pushing my boyfriend down the stairs) and his sister, who was also abused by his parents, is amazing and I encourage him to stay close to her. \n\nI just know that it's so shitty to prevent your partner from seeing someone and I worry I'm being overbearing. Part of me thinks he's an adult, he should make his own decisions, but I just think about him coming home sobbing and bruised because his mom hit him again. But now that all her kids are going to be out of the house this fall she's turning on the charm and I think trying to maintain control over him. And every time I talk about the cycle of abuse and how he can end the victimization he just gets heartbroken and says \"she's my mom\" and I don't fucking know what to say to that. I've never had a family member hurt me like that, I don't know what he's feeling. I want to protect him but I don't want to overstep his boundaries either.

Were both fairly busy buy realistically I could see her whenever I wanted still, but I am usually tired and just want to go home during the week. This means that weekends are usually the only option when it comes to hanging out. Biggest gripes I have are that A) she has no license and refuses to get one B) she still lives 40ish minutes away from my house, with no traffic. We live in NOVA so there's always traffic. All of this means to me that a day of hanging out is more like a weeks worth of driving. Go to her house, go to activity, go get food, go to next activity, go get ice cream, go see a movie, take her home, I go home. She's always wanting to do lots of things, which I am perfectly happy to do because I genuinely love her and enjoy spending time with her but after 2+ years (this happened last summer as well) of waking up at 10:30am on Saturday and not coming home until 1:30am I feel burnt out. \n\n\nThis all came about when I forgot to ask her to hang out a few weeks ago. I was super busy at work and it slipped my mind to ask her about our weekend plans. We fought and I asked \"what if I didn't even want to hang out\". She replied along the lines of \"that's stupid what's the point in dating if we don't see each other.\" We pretty much ignored that side of the argument and dealt with the rest of it until it came to a peak yesterday and I basically told her I had had enough and said some things that I somewhat regret. She now refuses to talk about it and is \"giving me what I want\". Which is basically \"you can hang out with me whenever you want but I'm not going to ask you\". I've since offered compromises (which she has rejected) like \"we limit ourselves to only a couple activities a day\" or \"we hang out earlier while only doing 1-2 things so I can go home early\" or \"we do small things over the course of Saturday Sunday\".\n\n\nWe have a long list of problems that basically stem from me being too insensitive and her being too sensitive.

In preparation for my move, I was looking into a short term rental for a few months while I looked for a more permanent place.\n\nThough a networking group, I found a woman, lets call her Alice, who lead me to believe that she was looking to sublet her apartment for a few months. We communicated, tentatively agreed on price and arranged a time for me to see the place in person.\n\nI get there, and Alice is not around, but the landlord is. Let's call the landlord Charlie. I introduce myself, and Charlie the landlord shows me around.\n\nCharlie the landlord tells me that while he has offered to lease the apartment to Alice, and they tentatively agreed on terms, Alice has not yet actually leased the apartment. As in, had not gotten a key, not signed a lease, not paid a deposit.\n\nObviously I'd only be able to sublet the apartment from Alice if she actually followed though on leasing it in the first place. Charlie the landlord added that he personally disliked Alice in their previous dealings, and that it was too bad I only wanted a short-term place, because he would much rather have me as a tenant.\n\nIt was a nice place, a reasonable price, and I was actually looking for a long term rental in the area - I just wasn't expecting this to be it.  I told Charlie the Landlord that if it was really available, I would take it on the spot. Charlie the landlord agreed and emailed me the lease. I read it over; we negotiated for a few minutes; then I wrote a check and Charlie the landlord handed me the keys. Mine.\n\nCharlie and I met the next day and signed the physical lease that matched what we'd agreed to. We made fun of Alice's unethical emails asking me to send her cash to secure my sublet of an apartment that wasn't hers.\n\nCool. I have a nice new rental. I finished my house hunting early. I don't need to deal with a temporary rental. I saved the cost of moving twice. Charlie and I don't have to deal with Alice, who it turns out is kinda-sorta a fraudster.\n\nAlice was furious and sent me several emails threatening to sue various people.  She apparently also had a heated exchange with Charlie.  I replied to Alice once, to say that neither of us had any say in who Charlie ultimately decided to offer a lease.\n\n\n**Alice's side - I'll try not to speculate on her motivation:**\n\nI was about to rent a great new place. The only wrinkle is that I was going to be traveling for work for a few months and I couldn't really justify renting it and leaving it empty. Then I met Bob, who offered to sublet it for a couple months while I was away. Perfect!\n\nI arranged for Bob to meet the Landlord and see the property. He said he liked it, everything was going smoothly. I just needed Bob to send me a security deposit before I leased it, so I wouldn't be locked into the lease with no one to live there.\n\nThen, Bob and Charlie showed their duplicitous colors because the next thing I know I'm getting a call from Charlie that the property is no longer available.\n\nFucking Bob! What am I supposed to do now?! I was counting on this lease going through. And Charlie offered to lease it to me, everything was arranged!

I thought the price was very fair, about 15% off from the price of the camera alone.\n\nI got a message from an interested lady who asked me a few questions about it, then requested to meet up. She lived about two hours away from where I am, so I agreed to meet her in the middle. \n\nI drove for about an hour and met her outside a police station. She inspected the camera, was happy with it, and when we were about to close the deal, she tried to haggle the price with me. It wasn't a bad offer, per se, about $75 off from my original price, but that irritated me for several reasons. One, she had never once mentioned the price throughout our numerous texts, and I'd also driven an hour out of my way to meet her as a courtesy. I told her no, that the price was firm, and she could either pay the full amount or I was leaving.\n\nShe got extremely angry and told me I'm an asshole, her offer was a good offer, etc. I repeated that I was leaving if she didn't have the full amount, and she told me to fuck off and keep the camera.\n\nWas I wrong for not accepting her offer on the spot? If she had brought it up in the beginning, I honestly might have, but I feel like you should hammer out all the details of a transaction before you agree to meet. Since she never once brought up an issue with my price or provided a counter-offer, I assumed we were good to go. It just pissed me off that I went out of my way to meet her halfway, then she had the balls to argue price with me. AITA here?",

    "selftext": "Good Morning! \n\nSo, like the title says- my three nieces (who're like ages 13 and 9 or something IIRC) came down with my mother yesterday when she returned from visiting Hot Springs, AR. \n\nLet me tell you something about two of these three girls. They suck. So badly. The third isn't terrible only because she's pretty young and not really super cognitive of what's going on around her. Let's call them Molly and Susan for context. \n\nA little bit of history- I'm 24. I'm adopted. I don't live at home. I DO live in the same city as my family.  My mother has a son from a previous marriage who is ABOUTTT 40ish years old. He's ex military. VERY much a southern man living in Ft. Worth. He has the traditional nuclear family. Three daughters. A dog. A wife. A chevy. And him and I NEVER were on the same page until I was about 17-18. He always teased me about being a little more feminine (I'm gay) He wasn't particularly warm. The only real reason we're any closer now is because he apologized for not being very \"brotherly\" my whole childhood. \n\nAdditionally- my mother does this shit where she'll put words in people's mouths and then swear to god she's telling the truth. For context, if I don't come rushing over to her home the first chance I get to see my awful spoiled rotten nieces then I'm \"breaking their hearts because ALL THEY WANT is to be able to see their uncle Youngaydult! It's ALLLL they've talked about\" (none of which is true). \n\nThe major problem though is these girls are SO negative and unable to keep themselves from saying the first negative thing that comes to mind. \n\n\"Why does your hair look like that?\"\n\"Why does your face look the way it looks?\"\n\"Why do you shorts come above your knee? You're boy\"\n\"Why do your nipples poke through your shirt\"  \n\"Why do you drink?\"\n\nIt's like every time I'm in the room some critical analysis needs to be conducted of why I'm the way I am and what's worse is the same huge question is always promoted; \"Why don't you ever come over when we're here? Why don't you like us\"\n\n...? Like... it's not rocket science to me. Maybe it's ridiculous that a 24 year old is so insecure that the words of a child can dent my ego so badly but I just would rather not be around it. I tried to explain it to my mother but she doesn't get it and is afraid if she says anything it'll result in her granddaughters not wanting to see her. \n\nSo- to me it's just better to stay at arms length.

A few days ago he told me that he wanted to be friends with a girl I know, \"Alyssa\", who has bullied my friends in the past. For example, she will draw fake self-harm marks on her arms with a marker and show them off at the lunch table as a way to make fun of a friend of mine who used to have a cutting problem, and also as a way to get herself negative attention. There's many other things she does, like pretending to be an alcoholic, bulimic, dying of cancer that magically went into remission the next day, a new thing every week honestly. It is very obviously fake that she doesn't have any of these issues.\n\nI told Rob that he probably doesn't want to be around Alyssa because I care about him and I didn't want him to be exposed to that kind of negativity, and I went into some details of all the things she's done. It wasn't a jealousy thing, I just didn't want him to deal with the stress of being friends with her. I had even told him about all these things a while before when I was venting about her. He said that he's never seen her do that himself so why should he take my word for it? I left him on Read.\n\nThe next morning my friend Cas texted me that Alyssa is now making a huge stink about my conversation with Rob the night before. I called Rob to ask what he told Alyssa and he said \"everything you said, basically just all the reasons you hate her. I thought that if you were going to talk trash about Alyssa she should get to defend herself\". \nMy friends are saying that Rob is the asshole in the situation, but I honestly still have a lot of doubt. I'm very angry at him for telling Alyssa, a girl he barely knows, all the bad things I told him about her, but I did say some pretty nasty things that I truly meant, because I hate when somebody romanticizes serious issues.

She didn't have a computer so I borrowed her my laptop (I had two at the time) with the words \"You can keep it as long as I don't need it\". Fast forward 7-8 months, I got let go from my job and my laptop died while I was still looking for a new job. I let my sister know I'll be needing my laptop back when she visits (she was visiting my parents whom I live with on a monthly basis). She agrees and when she visits she \"forgets\" the laptop. I was a little annoyed but I didn't give her shit, I just told her to be sure to bring it the next time. This is where the asshole part comes in. Suddenly she's not visiting my parents for a few months because she's so busy. I have to use my father's PC and he's being an asshole about it, telling me to fuck off of his computer as soon as he sets his foot in the house. Then my parents decide to visit them in the summer, about a month ago. I tell them to please return my laptop since they're visiting. They agree. Few days later father's coming back (mother was staying longer). He gets home, I ask where's my laptop (which I really need because thats how I look for a job and I dont think I have to explain why someone needs a computer in 2017). Turns out they were scheming the entire time not to return my laptop. He tries to play the \"we're family, we have to help each other\" card. My sister and her boyfriend both have decent jobs. I tell him it's easy to help people when you're giving stuff away thats not yours. I'm really angry at this point. Not only have they stolen from me, but they schemed behind my back. I didn't know which was worse and I was kinda at a loss for words. My father just wanted me to drop it throwing manipulative shit like \"one day you\"ll understand\" at my face. I saw the arguing was going nowhere and I'm never getting my laptop back so I drop it. I always had a shitty relationship with my parents and sister but this still caught me off guard. He was nice about me using his computer then for a week and reverted to asshole mode after that.

Mods please let me know if I should post this in r/Advice instead.*\n\nBackstory: So my mom's side of the family is pretty huge, and pretty religious. I have 8 uncles and aunts, and then comes 30 something cousins. I've never been extremely close with most of this side of the family; I hated going to family gatherings (almost always at my rich doctor uncle's house), and the family would rarely come visit us at our house, one state away, even though we had plenty of room for everyone (2 acres of land with a sizeable 3-level house, can't remember exact sq. footage). So yeah - we'd always have to plan to go about 2 hours away (if I remember correctly) and spend the day there. Not much to do except socialize with cousins, whom I felt were all very much like their parents. Like I said, I was never really close with them and I didn't quite fit in with the family model - religion, college, money, family, kids, etc. The main ones being religion and college I would say, they would always ask about it and I would tell them honestly I had no interest in either. Eventually, I wound up working in the medical cannabis field which really separated me from that side, specifically because that uncle is a doctor and was completely against it. So much so that he was unwilling to let my dying grandma try using it to treat her illness. I have been receiving wedding invites of my cousins, none of whom ever ask me for my address or mention the wedding; I'm assuming they'd ask my mom who would give them my current address and I'd have a wedding invitation waiting for me one day after work. I'd always decline.\n\nAnyway, hope that's enough to give you all an idea.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if it's okay for me to basically remove them from my Facebook and any other social media... possibly removing them from my life? I never felt like many of them were ever there for me or cared about what I was doing or interested in. It was just the whole \"family\" aspect of it. Sure, I never took too much of an interest in their lives but I feel like I was fairly honest about how I felt on that regard. I'm not into marriage, religion, college, etc. I know my mom knows how I feel about this, and I think she understands.\n\nAm I an asshole for feeling this way? Let me know if any additional information would help. Any criticism, comments, advice are very welcome. Thanks!",

She's not allowed to say no, but I can say no. She's not doing that anymore. She's going in on the contracting hours, and leaving on her contracted hours. 18 hours a week. 3 days a week. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. She won't be coming in on Sundays. She won't come in for 'a few hours' after Uni.\n\nB: You don't have any right to speak to me like that. She will work when I say she works.\n\nM: No. She won't. She will work what her contract says she works. If you want her to work different hours, draft a new contract, which says she will be paid for these hours, and stipulating her new role with these new duties, resulting in better pay. Otherwise she won't be coming in at all. And I will speak to you however I want.\n\nB: Then she won't have a job.\n\nM: Then you won't have a slave to boss around all day with no credit. And I'll be calling the Department for Work and Pensions and telling them of your business practices, if she suffers any negative consequences because of this.\n\nB: ... Tell her I'll discuss this with her tomorrow.\n\nM: I will. But just so you know she will be looking for a new job as of tomorrow. She will continue to do her best for you as she always has, but consider this informal notice of her desire to quit. She will give formal notice when she has a new job.\n\nHang up\n\nGF, who was sat there listening quietly but not interjecting, told me \"I shouldn't have said that\" and \"It's fine\".\n\nI said I don't think she has to put up with that, and to tell the truth I think she should have stood up for herself weeks ago.\n\nGF: \"I can't get another job like that with those hours\"\n\nM: \"You can, there are loads of places. And it was only half serious anyway. You can stay there indefinitely so long as he behaves himself.\"\n\nGF: \"What if he fires me?\"\n\nM: \"He can't fire you for something someone else did. That's unjust dismissal. And you can take him to Tribunal anyway. He won't risk it\"\n\nGF: \"Then what if he just makes it worse\"\n\nM: \"Then I call DWP and you quit. I wasn't joking\"\n\nThe conversation ended there. We didn't really argue but she was definitely in a mood. She was cold in bed that night and she barely said a word to me Sunday.\n\nThis was Saturday night. Fast forward to Monday (he didn't call her in Sunday, for a change), and she goes to work. He's fine to her, she arrives on time, and leaves on time, and seems fine when she gets back.\n\nSame yesterday.\n\nBut my GF still seems off with me now, Thursday.\n\nI was just trying to help her, because I know she wouldn't have said anything herself because she's not that kind of person and I know her uni work is starting to suffer for it. As is her health. I've never seen her so stressed.\nAITA?\n\nTL,DR: My GF boss is an asshole. Makes her work long hours. I call him up for a chat and make him stop being an asshole.\n\n\nEDIT: I realise today is Wednesday but I drafted this for submission on Thursday *last* week. I just didn't post until now as I wanted to see if she changed. She is still in a mood with me, but it's a lot better.",

    "selftext": "Before I get destroyed by all the waiters/waitresses on Reddit I acknowledge i am the asshole. BUT let me tell the situation and let me know to what degree of assholery I have achieved. \n\nSo I went out with some coworkers to a restaurant that's open til 2 am. We arrived and the whole party of 11 was seated by 1230. So it's not like we were egregiously late. When we get there the waiter was very kind and cool and said to hold on he forget his pad but he was gonna take out drink order. He was back quickly and we begin ordering drinks. I don't drink but several of my friends ordered some beers and I ordered a coke. It wasn't til after they ordered a specific beer that he mentions they are 1 dollar. Well obviously everyone (except me) changed their order to 1 dollar beers. We also asked for menus and utensils because no one brought them. \n\nHe returns timely with the drinks and the menus and all was swell. By this time it was about 1240. After maybe 10 minutes he comes back and they order a second round of drinks. Again he brings them out, not as fast as before but not a huge deal. He mentions that they are running out of glasses which is fine we were totally understanding and in no rush. I mention to run me 1 more coke when he can. I still had Hal a glass so I wasn't in a rush. \n\nAs he brings the second round we are also ready to order, which we do. A mix of entrees and appetizers and we pretty much let him know to keep the beers coming. There was no mention of the kitchen closing or last call...I'm sure you can see where this was going. At this time it was around 100. \n\nAt about 130 we were getting fairly annoyed because he hasn't brought out the third round of drinks. Right as we were talking about it he comes with the round. Great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd we let him know just keep them coming. After this a manager comes out to our table. She says that she has bad news. X appetizer is not available so choose something else. Also the kitchen is closed so we can only make fried foods. Uhhhhhh ok no biggie we only orders a couple of those so we just get wings. She adds, oh one more thing Y entree is not available. Wtf. This was only my reaction because Not only did I order appetizer X but I was also the only person who ordered entree Y. I am not a rude person at restaurant I usually just accept whatever I get no matter what so I just said ok let me have a menu. Once I get the menu the waiter leaves. I look at my friends and I'm like fuuuccckk. How the hell am I suppose to know what is fried and what isn't. He just left me there to guess. \n\nAt about 145 we get anxious and send someone inside to get the next round of beers. They come back and tell us they are going to bring out the drinks with the food. Um no we are thirsty and want them now. We didn't say that but you get my drift. We wait and wait and at 2 they come out with the food and drinks. Keep in mind my whole order was unavailable so not only do I have to watch other people eat my order still has to ha taken again. I tel the waiter what can I get since I know you said it has to be fried. He says \"well you can get wings or fries...\" yes the pause was included. This asshole told me the only thing I can order was fucking wings and fries. Whatever like I said i take whatever so I just orders 2 orders of wings. \n\nI'm glad my friends were there cuz they shared food and we were still having a good time. We were never rude or said snide remarks. We took what we got and just kept asking for drinks that never came. \n\nFinally my food comes. He doesn't bring any drinks even though we keep asking. He just says sure. My other friend had to beg to get water and I still had never received my second coke. I'm glad I didn't order any spicy wings. \n\nThe mood was still great no real complaints so time for the check. So we wait, and wait, and wait, and wait. By 230 we were getting very anxious and begin discussing what the fuck is wrong with this place. We discuss leaving but myself and a couple other friends are against it. One of them starts getting nervous that we might actually leave and goes to the waiter at his little computer and asks for the check. I shit you not this is what he said, \"oh uhhh idk I really don't remember what y'all ordered.\" She returns empty handed and we begin discussing for real about leaving. At 245 we said fuck it and left. No one followed us we were not sneaky. We straight up WALKED out and no one said a word. \n\nSo tell me AITA? BTW we left 12 dollars on the table  which I'm kinda mad about cuz I wanted to leave nothing. \n\nTLDR: received incredibly bad service at a restaurant and left. Waiter over half an hour for the check and never received it and even asked for it but never got it. ",

    "selftext": "I requested four days off of work, months in advance. It wasn't for any good reason, I got tickets to go to SDCC with a friend. I work in fast food and we're always short handed, but that's by design. There's a stack of applications on the desk but the RGM and the supervisor would rather hire very few people and force everyone else to work the jobs of three people so their bonus at the end of the year is bigger. I've also never called out sick before, and the only other time I requested days off was two days when I was part time and I put them in months in advance.\n\nNow, I've worked at this store for nearly a year. It was my first job, and I started out part time. However, I was quickly made full time, and I'm the only full time non manager in the store. Many of the managers have complimented my work ethic. That's not even me tooting my own horn, most of the people we hire do the bare minimum, call out constantly, then finally quit a few months later.\n\nWhen my manager told me that she probably wouldn't be able to give me my days off I started telling my coworkers that I was searching for another job and would quit  if I didn't get them. I didn't tell her directly, but because fast food is barely a step up from high school in that everyone lives on gossip and drama, I knew she would hear it one way or another. It should also be mentioned that this wasn't a hollow threat, either. I felt entitled to these days. I put in applications elsewhere and brought a letter of resignation with me on the day the schedule came out. This wasn't just over comic con, either, it was a culmination of fast food being a soul sucking hell, shitty managers unwilling to spend money to fix anything (we almost got closed down during our last corporate visit because so many of our machines were broken. They put in no uncertain terms that the reason our score was so low was because of how much shit was broken, but the supervisor bitched at all the employees who did everything right nonetheless), and just a generally shitty work environment. But me not getting those days off would have been the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nAnywho, I know I turned into a bit of a prick at the threat of not getting my days off, but as one of the hardest working people in that store I feel like I deserved a little break. Now that it's over and done with I feel kind of bad for how things played out (not for going to comic con, I had a blast), but it's really not my fault that they fucked themselves over by hiring only a few people and placing a ton of responsibility on minimum wage employees.

We've been staying here for a few days, me and my mom we were sleeping in the same room. There are two beds in that, one of which is normally a couch but can turn into a bed. \n\nAnyway, tonight my mom decided to sleep in the other guestroom, so instead of sleeping on the couch/bed, I slept on the bed she slept the night before. In the middle of the night, I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back to the room and just behind me enters my mom and drops herself on my bed. I tell her I was sleeping there, she doesn't respond. I'm annoyed but don't say anything, I tell her to at least give me my pillow so I can sleep on the couch/bed. She then tells me she will if I get her pillow from the other room, which I do. Then I proceed to make my own bed (at 3 in the morning), and lay on the barely made bed. Then my mom tells me to open the window cause it's getting warm inside. That's when I get really annoyed and don't respond. She repeats the same thing over and over, also waking up my sister, and 2 minutes later gets up. Seeing that I refuse, she takes my phone and says she won't give it back until I comply. She then tells me she will make my vacation a suffering if I don't open the window, and that i have no right to go against her will now that i am an legally an adult, and reminds me of all the things she has done (granted, she has done a lot for me, just as any mom would). I explain to her it's 3 in the morning, that I don't normally go against what she says, but that she is being very unreasonable making me do all this stuff after kicking me out of the bed I was sleeping in. She goes nuts and hits me, before saying she will make my vacation hell. Eventually, just so she stops being what I think is very childish behavior, with my sister sleeping and my uncle and aunt in the opposite room, I open the door. She then gives me my phone back. \n\nSo I think my mom is clearly being a jerk, not her typical behaviour, but am I an asshole for refusing to open the window?

It's been an amazing relationship so far. No huge fights, we've beaten her depression together, and we've just in general been really happy. I love her. \n\nI was her first everything besides a kiss. I have had sexual partners in the past, so I've done all of it before, but for her I'm  her only experience. \n\nShe talked to me about wanting an open relationship. She at first said that she felt like \"not enough for me\" and that getting more experience under her belt would make her more confident. But soon the reasoning started more leaning towards \"I didn't really get to experience the stuff most people experienced in highschool, and I feel like I'm missing out\"\n\nI said no to this. I don't want an open relationship at all, but I'm open to the idea of swinging with other couples (only other couples. No three ways)\n\nShe said that it is something she wants to experience, but I asked why do you want to experience that when our sex life is awesome. She didn't really have a response other than \"it's just something I want\". I kind of snapped at her and said \"really? Because for me it's sounding like I'm not enough, and you just want other guys dicks\"\n\nShe started apologizing (it's her nature to do that) and said she feels really bad about wanting that and shouldn't feel that way. I apologized for snapping at her and said that i understand where she's coming from, but I just can't do it\n\nShe still feels awful and is still apologizing weeks later, and I feel awful because I feel like it may have been out of line to shoot her down like that. \n\nI recognize it's completely within my \"rights\" to say no to an open relationship, but was it out of line for me to get upset? I just felt so jealous and hurt that she wanted to be with other men. \n\nEdit: we had a conversation about it. It went very well and some stuff came out about her mental health that sorta explains everything. We've found compromises and things are looking much better. Thanks you guys!",

We don't keep any dirty dishes or anything out, our house is just a little undersized and cluttered with bills, baby stuff, and objects.\n\nWhen my Mother-in-law comes over, she tends do make little adjustments, move things around, and clean things that I don't think necessarily need to be cleaned. A few examples:\nWe have a cat that eats plastic, and we tend to keep him locked out of rooms that have the potential for him to eat something. The bathroom is one example, and as a rule we keep the door closed. I came home from work, and although I had new towels and things were tidied up, the door was left open. \nOur downstairs has a dehumidifier that is set by me to take the humidity down to a manageable level(under 50%). Most days when I come home, it is cranked all the way up to max, and the room is 90 degrees because it's been running all day. I am the owner of the house, why would I not have it set properly?\nThings are generally moved around, and things like remote controls have been taken off the coffee table, and put into some random drawer. We always keep it on the coffee table. \nI'll often have things for work, that just disappear and end up put in a drawer.\n\nI appreciate that chores are getting done, but I kind of blew up at my wife when the cat ate a dryer sheet that on the floor of the bathroom that is supposed to be closed.. I suppose I am also a little insulted that she doesn't think our house is being taken care of, when actually it's a pretty typical looking house for a Gen Xer. \nAm I just a control freak that is overreacting, or is it ok to have boundaries, and get angry when they are passed?\n\nEdit(am I allowed to edit?): I would like to remark, that the term \"blowing up on her\" was probably a little more dramatic than what happened. It was more of a mutual back and forth fight, but I was the one that provided the topic of discussion. In fact, the way it happened was more like\n\nMe: \"The door upstairs was left open, and I think the cat ate some plastic.\"\n\nHer: \"Why are you telling me, it wasn't my fault?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not blaming you, I just wanted to let you know.\"\n\nHer: \"But when you say it like that, it feels like you are blaming me.\"\n\nMe: \"OMG, I'm not blaming you.\"\n\nHer: \"See, like that.\"\n\nMe: \"HOLY SHIT! I AM NOT BLAMING YOU!\"\n\nHer: \"SEE! NOW YOU'RE YELLING AT ME!\"\n\nMe: \"YOU'RE YELLING AT ME!\"\n\nHer: \"Well if you don't like how my mom cleans! Maybe you should do your own laundry!!!\"\n\nMe: \"This isn't about laundry at all! It's about shutting the damned door!\"\n\nAnd I just asked her to read this and verify that this is how it happened and she said \"Yes, it happened like that, but you said it in a nastier tone.\"",

Evidently the resident's committee of the building have decided that they want to keep an eye on who is parking where. I didn't bother putting it on the car because I know everyone (there's 20 flats) and we have a distinctive car that everyone knows is ours, which is always parked in the same spot of an evening because the other spaces are difficult with my wife's mobility issues and the car seat for our son.\n\nAnyway yesterday I spot out the window one of our neighbours examining the car and noting something down on a clipboard. I ask him if he needs any help getting a closer look. He tells me if I don't put the ticket he's made on the car then it'll have to be towed. I tell him I'm not going to bother because everyone knows it's our car, it's in our space, they have no right to tow cars here anyway because there are no parking enforcement signs and that he can get over himself.\n\nHe tells me \"Well we've all decided this is what we're doing\" and suggests that we don't have the right to complain because everyone else owns their flat and ours we rent.\n\nI feel that (and my wife agrees) some of the residents are opposed to the flats being let out and that they want to force us out and the owner of ours to sell up.

    "selftext": "I started talking to this girl (we will call her Janice) a week ago, and we seem to hit it off on OKC\u2019s chat. Janice\u2019s profile seemed alright and I found her attractive, and we were both looking for something serious and long term.\n\nThe two of us eventually decide that we can meet over the weekend on Sun afternoon. Janice lives 2 hours away from me at a smaller city (I am at one of the bigger cities in the states). So, I decide to make the trip to a public place close to her so we can meet for the very first time in person, because I have friends in a different city not so far away from her. And I was planning to crash at their place for the night since I got Monday off. We also decided early on to not share any personally identifiable info (like last names, phone #s etc.). If we met at a public place at a specified time, it wouldn\u2019t be that difficult to find each other since we know how either of us look like. And OKC\u2019s app can be backup in case plans change last second. I always do that if I am meeting someone new through the interwebs/darkweb, and don\u2019t share those details if both of us are happy with doing so until after the first meet/date.\n\nFf to last evening, we were chatting and somehow, we end up low-key sexting. We both gave in and did so for a good hour or so, it was hot, and I hate doing so with strangers, but my knees can only take so much. This morning though, Janice starts telling me that she can\u2019t wait till Sun, and clears up Sat (which she was spending with one her friends). I cannot drive over on Sat because I had other errands. Janice is OK with driving over to my city on Sat and that seemed like an OK compromise. But turns out she gets super-anxious driving in big cities with traffic. The thing is most public places are in the heart of the city. Janice suggests if she could drive up to my place and if we could then drive down to the city or take an Uber together. I initially say no, but later end up going along with (even though I hated it). After some time, Janice starts complaining about how she has to drive 4 hours to meet me, and that she wished she had family/friends in the city I live in so she could stay over for the weekend, and that she\u2019d be spending all weekend on the road. And kept doing that every time I tried to talk about something else. I do night shifts, and this really was cutting through my skin of patience, so I tell her that if our date goes well, she\u2019d be more than welcome to crash at my place for the night or the weekend depending on her plans for Sun. That seemed to stop her from complaining. And by stop, I mean just completely stop sending me messages.\n\nI assumed Janice got busy so I took a nap before my classes. I woke up at noon, and got several messages for her with a completely different tone. She called me a creep for trying to bring her to my place for an entire weekend before even meeting her. And doesn\u2019t feel comfortable knowing I am OK with bringing complete strangers to my personal space like that. I re-iterate that I was offering in case she wanted to get some rest, if driving back seems exhausting and only if I feel comfortable with her after meeting her in person. Janice tells me how I am probably just looking for sex and want to force her into sex, and that our height difference makes it easy for me to rape her (she\u2019s more than a foot shorter than me). This infuriated me like crazy because we\u2019ve talked about the height difference before. She was always intimidated by it, and me being bigger than most people didn\u2019t help that matter. I was cranky and groggy because naps are shit and I\u2019ve still got a long day ahead of me. So, I tell her that she does not have to go out to meet someone that she isn\u2019t comfortable. She lashes out further and calls me a dick for saying things she never implied and that I pulled the plug without even trying. That men like me are pigs and like putting their appendages in every hole they desire, regardless of age, gender or consent. I told her I found double-standards annoying earlier and she seemed to use it perfectly to provoke me. I call her the shallowest waste of a hole that no man wants to stick appendages into, yeah I suck at these (I have been told my use of profanity is cringe-worthy so I try not to use it), block her and delete the messages and was in awe how things turned out to be over the course of the week. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand what I said, implied, assumed or did wrong. I know this story is biased and one-sided but that\u2019s the most objective I can be right.  \n\nSorry for the long post/rant.",

This was before I even moved out of my parents house and had my own stable income. Now that I've moved out and am living on my own and I've seen that she's not the best with money, I no longer see that as feasible. Over time my opinion changed.\n\nOne night she started a fight with me because I didn't buy her a drink after she insisted I buy it for her because it's \"only $1\". She has her own money from her parents and also lives with them. During the fight she went on and told me how I must've \"been lying\" about being fine with supporting her... 2 years ago. I told her that my opinion on that changed and I would expect her to have her own income if we get married\n\nThere have been other times too where she tried to hold me to opinions I had two years ago when we first started dating.

This trip is to a halfway point about 3 hours from where we live, it's a small 2 bedroom hunting cabin that I spent my summers in. There's no cable or WiFi, no cell signal, just you and nature. The cabin is significant to my father and I so we chose there to meet up.\n\nNow. My SIL Mary has been voicing that she wants to go too, which means bringing the baby.

    "selftext": "About a month ago, I was editing my roommate's paper on her laptop and accidentally spilled water on it. Long story short, the laptop short-circuited and was completely fried. I did everything I could during the week after to help her, including lending her my old laptop indefinitely (which she is still using), emailing professors for assignment extensions, and taking her laptop to multiple repair stores for a diagnosis, one of which managed to get a couple of assignments back to her the next day and eventually clone her entire HD, which I paid $150 for. Unfortunately, the laptop itself was too water-damaged to be saved. I offered to pay the current value of the laptop to her, it was the most basic model 2014 Macbook Pro Retina, and on Craigslist was selling for between $750-1000. We agreed that I would pay her $800 since I already paid $150 for the HD extraction (so a total of $950). \n\nTo me, since I'm paying for the value of the laptop, I'm essentially buying her broken laptop for $950, and now own that broken laptop and am free to sell it for parts and make back some of the money. She sees it as me paying because I spilled water on it and am paying for the replacement, and doesn't think I should have the old laptop. I need some perspective, is my expectation reasonable or am I the asshole here?\n\nEDIT: Additional context, I'm a student so $950 is a large amount of money for me (I'm not saying I shouldn't have had to pay or anything, obviously I broke it I pay for it, but just that it's a significant chunk of money and making back $200-300 from selling the old one would have a bigger impact).",

Well while i was vacuuming her bed to put the bedding i washed that day back on <we have dogs so i was de furring> she came in and turned off the vacuum behind me. She then grabbed me by my hair and pulled me off, getting in my face about the house not being clean saying \"what have you been doing all day\".

You couldnt have done anything\" <note: i will admit it looked bad since i spent a few hours dissasembling ang cleaning the vacuum trying to fix the suction> so i sit quietly as she smacks me in the back or head and continues yelling about how i just sit on my ass and don't contribute to anything.

She stops hitting me and looks shocked a second before grabbing my wrists and i start shouting how when she gets in my face i reacted and im only human. I just reacted. I didnr want to its just the urge got so bad i did it without even meaning to. She just shouts and makes me leave before calling me back and talking. She asks if i think im too hard on her then points out how many chances i get to do things before they get this far. When i said i react i meant her hitting and pulling my hair but i guess she thought i meant about the chores. Or she was saying its all my fault for not doing it in a timely manner im not sure. Im not going to talk to her about it because i learned before that that just creates more shouting <note i have NEVER touched my mother before this moment.

I've also learned that this is quite common in America, I don't know.\n\nI'm a sailor, from the UK working for the UK Government. And I recently put into port in a not very friendly country that will remain nameless, and the only place the company I worked for felt safe to put me was a US Navy base. \n\nThis base is not officially US territory, because it's in another country, but it's granted all the privileges of it. It's a pretty big base and, naturally, has a *lot* of Americans.\n\nI decide to go to see a movie. I'm bored and I haven't had the chance to do that for a while, so that's what I go do. I go alone because for me that isn't an issue.\n\nIt's a pretty packed theatre, and at the start of the movie, the US National Anthem starts playing.\n\nThis is a little weird, but whatever I roll with it. Then everyone in the theatre stands and puts their hand on their chest. Everyone except me.\n\nI find this to be extremely strange, but I don't laugh. I just don't participate. \n\nAnyway, the anthem finishes and it's no problem, everyone sits down. But this one guy (GUY 1) who is sitting next to me, the *second* his bum touches the seat \"so what's the deal buddy, you hate America?\" or words to that effect. \n\nI'm taken back by this, because I didn't think I had done anything wrong, I say something like \"What? No. Why would you think I hate America?\"\n\nAnother person (GUY2), behind me, obviously hearing this, chimes in \"In America we show respect to our flag and our nation, don't care what you guys do but this is America\" (I mean, it technically isn't but I don't argue the point).\n\nME: \"Well, I'm not American and to be honest I had no idea this was a thing\".\n\nGuy 1: \"You're in America, I don't care where you're from. Respect our country\".\n\nME: \"I do respect your country. But, sorry mate, I didn't know this was something I had to do\"\n\n\nIt carries on for a little while, not too long cos, y'know, movie theatre and people want to watch the movie. \n\nI sit and watch it, and despite feeling the odd glance from Guy 1, 2 and a few other silent observers, I still enjoy it. The movie ends, and everyone claps... Except me. \n\nI also didn't know this was a thing, and seemed very odd for me. But whatever. I stand up to leave, and find Guy 1 blocking my way. He wasn't being overly aggressive, but definitely wasn't being friendly \"If you don't like America you're welcome to leave our base any time buddy\" and storms off...\n\nI go back to the ship, have a pint, and basically spend the rest of the night confused as to what the fuck I did wrong... \n\nMy position is simple: I don't hate America, far from it. I actually like the country. It's just not something I had ever heard of or experienced and I didn't know I was expected to stand. Also, though I didn't mention it at the time, I'm not American so it's not my anthem. Why would I stand?\n\nAITA?\n\n\nTLDR: I'm British. Went to a movie on a US Military base in a foreign (not American) nation. Didn't stand for anthem. They didn't like it.",

    "selftext": "My wife and I are taking a long weekend to visit my parents. They live out of state, far enough that flying makes more sense than driving. \n\nAnyway, my wife has a really large family on her mom\u2019s side and they\u2019re spread across the country.  Every time we go on a trip or take a vacation it seems like we\u2019ll be near someone on her side or an old friend.  It never fails that she wants take a half a day to see them and \u201chave lunch.\u201d  I hate this.  With the exception of her mother, aunt and a few cousins, she has shallow relationships with the rest of her family.  The \u201csee each other once every 5 years kind.\u201d  It makes me very uncomfortably because I\u2019m not a very social person.  It takes me time to talk to new people, but whenever we see her family I\u2019m peppered with questions and feel like I\u2019m being interrogated.  \n\nBack to this weekend.  Earlier this week, before we left for the airport, my wife mentioned wanting to have lunch with her great uncle and his wife.  I told her we should talk to my parents before making plans that impact them.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday.  My parents picked us up from the airport and on the ride back to the house she again mentioned wanting to have lunch with her uncle before we leave Sunday.  My dad sort of brushed it off, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.  We had a few things we wanted to show you.\u201d  \n\nI should mention my family has never been good with direct confrontation.  I\u2019ve worked on it a lot in my life, but we\u2019re very touchy sometimes, feeling like we\u2019ve been but on the spot.  This is nothing short of a full rebuke from my father.  \n\nNow to today.  We\u2019re again in the car when my wife suddenly pulls out her phone and calls her Uncle\u2019s wife and makes plans for us all on Sunday.  I was shocked, so we\u2019re my parents.  At this point I should mention that her great uncle is 88 and has really bad dementia.  His wife is about 20 years younger and while very nice, it\u2019s not pleasant being around them.  I\u2019ve met them twice, once at my wedding and once a few years later and both times her was very loud and yelling that he wanted to go home.  \n\nMy parents know this.  They met him at the wedding.  When we got back to the house they pulled me aside and asked what the hell that was all about.  I apologized and told them I was sorry and I\u2019d talk to her.  \n\nThe second I brought it up she said \u201cwe\u2019d talked about it\u201d and everyone was on board.  I told her she was mistaken, no one said they wanted to do that and told her I was angry she was so presumptuous to assume that I, let alone my family, would want to have lunch with someone who has such disruptive dementia.  On top of that I told her I was angry that she just steamrolled ahead with these plans and put us all on the spot.  \n\nIn response my wife threw a fit and demanded an apology.  I refused and now she\u2019s locked up in the bedroom and won\u2019t talk to me.  \n\nI\u2019m really frustrated because she\u2019s acting like she did everything perfectly normal and I blew up.  It\u2019s like she has zero sense of self-awareness.  My parents are definitely not going and I wish I didn\u2019t have to, but I probably must if I ever want my wife to talk to me again.  \n\n\nTLDR: while visiting my parents my wife made lunch plans for all of us with her great uncle who she has seen twice in 5 years and maybe 7 times in her life.  He suffers from severe dementia and is loud and borderline abusive.  I told my wife it was inconsiderate and rude to make these plans without having an actual conversation with us about it.  My parents don\u2019t want to go and neither do I, but I will likely be forced to.  ",

Spouse is furious, hurt, and accuses me of forbidding their actions. I explain that I cannot forbid things, obviously.

We were in one city up til now, but we drove in to the city we fly home from today (we arrived today and fly home tomorrow.)

My mom married my step dad when I was 14 and while I consider him my Dad, he was never around before I hit puberty. \n\nThe issue is, my mom wants to switch to a hotel in one of the hotels with two beds instead of having us stay in both hotels. The other hotel room is free, so it's just a convenience thing. She asked my opinion and I told her I wasn't super comfortable staying in a room with my step dad, especially because I'm on my period right now. I love him like he's my father, but I'm a grown woman. I don't mind sharing with my sister in the slightest, we even shared a bed in the last room. I know it's inconvenient and it's only one night, but I'd really rather not share a room and bathroom with my step dad. My mom is annoyed and keeps saying \"we'll see,\" but it just seems ridiculous to not just use the other room. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit- Because it's been asked a few times already: the second room is free. It will not cost anyone anything extra to use it.

    "selftext": "So this girl. Me 34m, her 28f. We're neighbours, and great friends, and I genuinely enjoy her company, and we've fooled around a bit but it would never work because we always get in dumb arguments and she gets ridiculously insulting and I won't date someone who says hateful things when they lose their temper.\n\nANYWAY. Yesterday she asks to borrow my vacuum, and I say fine, just bring it back tonight (I'm very protective of my vacuum). She groans a bit, and I'm like, why do you need it for more than a couple of hours at most, you can come borrow it any time you want, you just can't keep it overnight. A few hours later she asks what I'm up to and I say not much, want to come for dinner? and she says \"nope, I'm out for the night, xo.\" And I say \"so, does that mean you're done with my vacuum,\" and she says \"don't worry, I'll lock up.\" And I say \"Haha, listen, I want my vacuum,\" and she says \"Is that really your brain process works? Are you kidding me? I'll be over with your damn vacuum in an hour.\" Two hours go by, and I message her, saying \"hey, what's up?\" She replies: \"Hello you.\" I say \"Vacuum?\" And she loses it: \"Omg...you're fucking pathetic, I actually hate you, come get your damn vacuum.\" I think she's mad that I don't trust her with it. I'm not a super trusting person, I don't think that makes me an asshole, but whatever. I go over to her house and get the vacuum. She's drunk and belligerent and mean, and I leave, and I send her a message saying something like \"No idea what your problem is, but I'll come and ask you tomorrow.\"\n\nNext morning (this morning). She asks my buddy (31m) and I if we want to go for brunch. I tell buddy that I'm still super unimpressed with her for being so rude, and that I'd LOVE to go to brunch with her and call her out for it. Buddy laughs and says he will not bring me if I don't agree to behave, so I agree to behave. We get to White Spot and we're talkin' and getting along great, until the conversation turns to her being mad at me for talking shit about somebody...then she says that she read my phone once and saw all the shit that I talk about her. I roll my eyes...buddy interjects that whatever I was saying probably didn't feel to me like \"talking shit.\" She pointed out the time that I told some other girl that I couldn't meet up with her because I was \"babysitting a drunk.\" I just shrugged and said \"so?\" \"A drunk,\" she says. I look at her and say \"You are a drunk.\" I mean, she is. Buddy is already excusing himself to go and have a smoke because he knows this isn't turning out good. Girl looks mad and maybe a little hurt. She says to me \"You look me in the eyes and say that with such confidence...,\" so I double down and look her right in the eyes, \"You. are. a drunk.\" Bam, she throws her drink in my face and storms off. The glass hits the seat and rolls onto the floor and shatters. Server asks if I'm alright. I shrug and order a coffee. At this point I really want my eggs benedict.\n\nSo my questions today are:\n\n1) Is what I am doing here in this thread \"Talking shit about her?\" Would she be justified in being angry at me for this post?\n\n2) Am I the asshole for telling a drunk to her face that she's a drunk?\n\n3) Am I the only one who feels really uncomfortable lending out their vacuum?\n\n4) Is it bad of me to be more concerned with being right than with her feelings in this situation? Because I frankly find it difficult to care. Some part of me cares, but a bigger part of me is like \"stay away from this girl,\" but an even bigger part is like \"troll her about it.\"",

Also, you can use this tag if you are anticipating a conflict in your own life based on current differences of opinion that are likely to come to a head.  Since the overwhelming majority in this sub object to the idea that a person's thoughts or feelings can make them the asshole, it is important that you anticipate what you or the other party is going to do about the problem, and allow judgement of the potential actions, not the ideas.\n\n*Please be clear on whether the story is completely made up, or just something you are anticipating based on your actual life.*   See below for examples.\n\n\n**Hypothetical Example:** \n\n&gt;[WIBTA] Would I be the asshole if I call the cops and got my cheating wife arrested?\n\n&gt;My wife cheated on me with a string of dudes while I lived out of town working a construction project to help pay her way through college, among other things.  Now that she has graduated, I find out she has changed the locks and wants a divorce.  Since she already broke all trust in our relationship, would I be the asshole if I called the cops and told them one of these guys is selling drugs out of her house, which he is?  She'll probably get arrested and jailed, but I want to move back into the home I hold half the mortgage on (but have realistically paid 90% of), and don't think I'd be able to win free access to it if the drug issue never came to light.  \n\n&gt;(No, none of this has ever happened to me in real life.)\n\n\n**Semi-Hypothetical Example:** \n\n&gt;[WIBTA] Would I be the asshole if I cut my Dad off of Netflix?\n\n&gt; About four of five years ago, my father retired to another state and was trying to cut back on bills and live within a fixed income.  I suggest he try Netflix instead of cable, and gave him my password and blessing to set up his own profile and use my account.  (I actually checked with Netflix, [and they allow this](\nhttp://fortune.com/2017/07/11/netflix-hulu-password-sharing/), even with users who don't share a household.)   He's been happily using my account ever since. \n\n&gt;A few days ago, he called me to tell me how much a huge pain in the ass passwords and logins have become in his life and started rattling off current passwords he's using to describe how much he's had to complicate them to satisfy password rules.  Eventually I realize that somewhere between a quarter to a half of all the passwords he uses are exactly the same as or are based on my Netflix password!  He's even registered himself for some sites with a username I like to use and combined it with my password!!  I'm really pissed about this because while neither of us is a security expert, we both know it's a bad idea to use the same password on multiple sites.  I have broken this rule myself whenever possible, but I think that's my risk to take on my own account.  Him using my password makes me wonder how many crazy virus heavy places he's been on the web and how many unidentified e-mail attachments he has opened and been oblivious to.  But I don't want to upset my dad, and I only calmly say, \"Gee I never imagined that me giving you a password for TV would result in that password being used all over the web for stuff that I don't know is secure.   What if you get a virus with a keylogger, and it notes password combinations, and tries them with all the e-mails in your address book??  I don't think that's really likely, but why make me take the risk?\"  He said he basically forgot whose information was whose, and got in the habit of using it as a base for new passwords.  \"It's no big deal.\"  I let it drop and we talked about other topics.  Eventually, the topic of unanticipated risks and consequences re-emerged and I made a wry comment about how giving out my password had unintended consequences, and he said I am crazy and paranoid to think I will ever be hacked because of his use.  I really don't want to upset him, so I let it drop.  \n\n&gt; It is worrying me, though.  So today I reset all my passwords that relate to that root password, and changed my netflix password.  Would I be an asshole if I changed my Netflix password and told him to get his own account, if he still wants one (which he does)?\n\n&gt; **TL;DR** - My dad was trusted with some of my login info and has absent-mindedly used it for his own accounts all over the web.  I think this is thoughtlessly risky so I'm changing everything and not giving him back access to the account he was using.\n\n&gt; (Yeah, this is basically true, but I haven't changed Netflix or cut him off yet.)",

    "selftext": "This is my throwaway because I don't want my friends knowing my main. It's also a small issue I'm posting purely out of curiosity- my fianc\u00e9 and I have a great relationship and I walked away before this dissolved into an actual fight, but I'm interested in opinions. \n\n\n*The Disclaimer:* I was diagnosed with chronic insomnia when I was 10, and I'm 26 now. Last year I was finally prescribed a sleeping pill that worked. As in, for the first time in my entire life I can sleep through the night (and fall asleep under four hours) while being sober. I used to have to drink myself to sleep, but no longer! (Yay for not using alcohol as a crutch)!\n\nAlso, I work two jobs and my fianc\u00e9 works odd hours at his one job, so time together to commit to television is a little limited.\n\n*The Issue At Hand:* I was home by five today and my fianc\u00e9 by four, giving us a rare afternoon together. I'm celebrating a promotion that lines right up with Stranger Things coming out. Obviously we have the makings of an awesome night. \n\n\nI ran out of my sleeping pills last week and I have a refill but haven't had the time to pick it up (two jobs). As a result, I'm fucking tired. I've been tossing and turning for nights, skipping my skin routine and makeup routine for the sake of an extra five minutes with my eyes closed. I've also been going to bed earlier (normally around 10, but I've been turning in between 7:30 and 8). I know that seems ridiculously early, but when you need to devote half your night to trying to fall asleep, you need all the time you can get. My fianc\u00e9 and I have lived together for two years, so he is well aware of my sleep disorder.\n\n\nWhen I got home at five, I wanted to watch the first episode of Stranger Things right away. He told me he wanted to wait, until after dinner. He was thawing out some food. That's fine by me. But 7 pm rolls around, that's TWO HOURS, I've suggested putting it on twice now but he wants to wait until after dinner. Having not slept in several days, I'm a yawning machine. He says, casually, that he's going to watch it without me if I went to bed. I thought he was joking because we're huge fans of this show and watched season one together, even if it took a while to sit down and watch an episode (remember, not a lot of tv time). \n\n\nBut, no, he went on to say it was not fair to expect him to wait if I went to bed because he is working all weekend (Sundays are my one day off), and that he would probably end up watching a few episodes without me. This kind of hurt my feelings because I work 60 hour weeks to help keep us afloat, I'm not home as often because I have a second job, and I always wait for him to watch a show if it's one we watch together, even if it's my day off but he won't be home until the late evening.\n\nWe didn't get far in the conversation before I walked away. Because I don't have my meds I've been having a few drinks to help me sleep, and I've been argumentative before after a few drinks, so I didn't want to let the fact that I'm tipsy dictate my decision making, so I told him I wasn't mad, but I thought it would be shitty if he started without me and I went to bed. I think we should have talked it through more maybe, but also it's just a tv show and not worth the argument, especially if I've had drinks. I'm not an angry drinker but if I'm tipsy and he says something hurtful I take it harder than usual so I left the room instead. \n\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation? Be honest, friends tell the truth. \n\n\nTldr: I'm cruisin for a snoozin but my man is turning up his need for Stranger Things to 11. \n\n\nEdit! I decided this was stupid, we talked about it, laughed about out it, and now I'm eating the delicious dinner he cooked and were are loading Netflix right now!",

I got a stable job, began renting a house in a very nice suburb, and had three cars in my name. Well... Then I got laid off and immediately started looking for work again. I had enough of a cushion to hold me steady for a few months. Or so I thought.\n\nI got pneumonia about a month into being unemployed. I had been flippant and hadn't bothered looking into individual insurances, I was positive that what ever job I landed would have a benefits package. Medical bills started adding up quickly and I was in over my head before I knew it.\n\nI found a way out of my lease and my parents agreed to let me stay with them until I was back on my feet. I now sleep in their basement on an awful hide-a-bed couch with absolutely zero privacy or personal space. I got a job close to their home and I've been climbing out of my hole for three months now. I sold two vehicles and used the money to pay a good majority of my medical expenses. But in that process, I wound up short on car insurance the first month I lived with them. My mother offered to help me with it and I agreed to pay her back.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I went to pay my insurance again, only to find that it had been paid. I immediately asked my mom if she was the culprit, expecting it to have been a nice gesture. One that I would thank her for and offer to pay back once again. But this time was different. She absolutely tore into me about how she shouldn't have to be saving my ass when I can't pay my bills. She told me that she's been taking and opening my medical bills and keeping track of what I owe, and paying them. Which is ridiculous to me because I've been making bi-monthly payments on them this entire time unknowingly. She told me that she opened my auto insurance bill and saw that I was a week late, so she took it upon herself to 'save me once again', as she put it. Again, total nonsense since I've asked her to do so little for me and I've been financially independent since I was sixteen. \n\nI got my dad involved and at first he sided with me. But all she had to do was shoot him a dirty look and he was all onboard with me being ungrateful and irresponsible. I finally got fed up and told my mother that she needs to get her nose out of my finances and that she was only making matters more confusing and frustrating for me. She countered me by stating that I would have to start paying them rent since I think I'm made of money. There is no common ground!\n\nShe's positive that her actions were justified and necessary. I'm half way through my twenties and have had plenty of time and experience in handling my own money and bills. She tells me that she will continue opening my bills and paying them because she doesn't want me to be a homeless nobody. This is really infuriating and I'm toeing a fine line between respecting my parents and being angry with them not respecting me. God forbid I have a say in it either way. \n\nAm I the bad guy for not being willing to let her continue trying to manage my money? She grills me on what I have in my bank account, what my paycheck amounts are, and what I'm spending my money on. None of this is any of her business.\n\nI typed this in a moment of frustration, and I'm sure I missed details that would help. Ask me and I'll answer anything you want to know.

As you can see, \n\nHere's where the trouble starts: last year I was irresponsible and allowed myself to get randomly matched to a roommate in the honors dorm. \n\n*no big,* I thought, *if it's an honors kid they'll have some semblance of personal responsibility and I'll be fine*\n\nEnter the shit roomate. The first red flag was when I moved in and saw the way he treated his mom. We're both sons of immigrants and my time away from home has just made me more appreciative to all the work that my parents did to put me in an expensive school, so I cringed a little inside when I saw him treat his mom like an impatient, entitled brat. But whatever, a lot of people have issues with their parents and are fine otherwise. The issue is that now he treats me the same way.\n\nLike a child, he doesn't clean up his messes or does his share in the work of cleaning up the room. All the cleaning supplies that his parents got for him are apparently there for me to use. He leaves puddles and toilet paper rolls on the bathroom floor and piss on the toilet. All this is fine, as we have two other suitemates who pick up the slack enough for it to be barely noticeable.\n\nThe real problem is that he adheres to the typical fucked up college schedule, where he goes out on weeknights and comes back super late drunk/high, makes a lot of noise, then goes to bed. The suitemates and I have tried communicating to him about the noise, but he just blows us off. Out of all of us premeds, he(a philosophy major) is the only one who doesn't have to get up in the morning, and usually sleeps through the morning and takes long naps throughout the day, which makes it sustainable to him, but is destroying me. At a certain point I gave up and just shifted my schedule to work/play games until he comes home, then go to bed.\n\nToday he came home as I was working late, high as balls, and asked if he could smoke in the room. I said no, because the night before, he did, and I was up all night because of the smell. He said he was just gonna do it anyways, and I told him I already was accommodating him as much as I could, and that I was as entitled to the space as he was. That didn't go over well. He basically called me a shut in, and told me that normal people lead normal lives and leave the room every so often, because he never gets any time to himself in the room. Just for the record, I left the room at 8:30am and was bouncing between classes and labs until 9:00pm. At that point I was tired and pissed enough that I went in on him, listed all my grievances, and stopped short of calling him an idiot. He again called me a loser, and started in on that college bro lecture on how I wasn't living life. I asked him why he needed the room to himself so badly, and he said it was because he needed to do work. Fat chance. I've lived with this guy long enough to know that his M.O. does not consist of this thing called \"work\". For him, college is just a party ticket (the school I'm in is pretty famous for being a party school) and an expensive gym membership. He just wants the space for sex and as a nicer hangout with his friends. I told him he was being entitled, and that if he had any real complaints I'd be fine with them. He called me a pussy, said I wouldn't be able to fight him if he wanted to make me leave, and said he was high as fuck and asked if I was jealous.\n\nI thought it would be fine if we just stayed out of each other's way like normal roommates it would be fine, but between him not being an adult with day to day stuff and threatening me with the same bullying I hadn't experienced since elementary school, I can't take it anymore. As I'm sitting in the common room fuming, I keep thinking about how I could report him for drug use and threatening me and get him out of my hair for good. But obviously (and the reason why I'm here) the consequences are harsh. Our college and state is on the more draconian side of things, so whatever drops on his head will be heavy. \n\nMy concern over him harming me is not to the point of alarm, although it is real. I don't feel comfortable sleeping in my own bed tonight. I'm scared of what he might do, but I'm more pissed at getting kicked around like this. At this point this sub is what is keeping me in check to dropping them hammer on him. Thanks for the help.\n",

    "selftext": "  Throwaway. Sorry for any typos. I\u2019m on mobile and pretty mad right now \n\n   Let my preface this by saying me and my brothers are all in college this year. Well one of them took a gap year to play hockey. Last year, they were seniors in high school, so they were still at home with my parents and being 100% supported financially by them. Clothes and electronics (laptops, new Xbox) and all. For the past three years since I\u2019ve been in college, I\u2019ve been in college, I've been financially dependent on them for my plane ticket home from school, my phone and food when I'm home. Everything else I get is paid for by a student loan that I have to pay back. \n  Last year for the holidays (we don't really do Hanukkah or Christmas, just a random day where we give eachother a few presents), my brothers got Calvin Klein winter coats, Lululemon clothing, $200+ cologne (they were 17!!!) and new phones. I got a pair of socks and a graphic shirt. I shit you not. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful for getting something. I honestly didn't care if I got anything at all. I just felt like shit watching them open all of those nice gifts and then I got socks and a shirt.  \n   It was an awful feeling because one of my brothers (the one taking the gap year) is the obvious favorite in the family and everyone including friends and extended family know it, but my mom refuses to admit it. He gets whatever he wants throughout the whole year including really expensive designer clothes and brand new hockey equipment which is upwards of $1000 for the skates he uses. If he does that get what he wants, he gets nasty and violent. \n   This year, my mom asked me to go shopping for present s with her and I refused because I went with her to buy all of my brothers presents last year and spent hours finding the perfect stuff for them and got nothing in return. I didn't need anything over the top, just a little more effort than socks. \n   So I called my mom out on what happened last year and she went off on me about how I'm ungrateful and how I'm gonna a put her in her grave and that she does everything for me and how she has no money. I fucking lost it. I mean every now and then she\u2019ll buy me a new dress or a new phone case or something like that if we are out shopping together, but I never DEMAND she does it. She does it because she\u2019s my mother and she\u2019s being nice even though I cpuld buy those things for myself. And my parents dont live paycheck to paycheck but they definitely struggle sometimes. Yet she buys such expensive shit for my one brother all the damn time and if anyone in the family calls her out, she explodes. She just visited him at a hockey tournament in Arizona for a week (we live in NY and she flew and booked a resort hotel) but then we struggle to have food in the fridge. \n   I don\u2019t need to get gifts from her for the holidays. I really dont care. I just find it unfair that she gets my brothers such nice things then makes up lies for why she wont get me anything nice. It just makes me feel like she does\u2019t care about me as much if that makes sense. I\u2019ve told her this, but her response is that I\u2019m a spoiled bitch and I\u2019m going to put ber in an early grave. \n   So, reddit, am I the asshole for calling out my mom?\n\nTL;DR: am I the asshole for calling out my mom for getting my brothers super nice gifts for the holidays while she got me socks and a tshirt. She claims im being spoiled. All I want her to know is that my feelings are hurt. ",

My cousin is mentally damaged, most likely from the stuff with her mom. I understand that. I understand that she's just a child and that she's been through hard stuff. \n\nIt's just that, the cousin in question has molested my four year old brother(he doesn't live with me. He lives with his mom. I caught her in the act when I went to check and see if they were asleep. Don't want to go way into the details but it was super obvious what was going on.) that same night she admitted to doing similar things to other kids, both male and female. Sometime after that she went to stay in a mental facility. My mother all of the sudden discharged her AMA two days ago. The reason being... She was being accused of molesting two children in the facility. I don't know why but my mom doesn't believe she did it, but it seems obvious to everyone else especially considering her history. I also think that my mom knew it would mean that we'd have to be investigated by DHS. \n\nAnyway, we moved into my grandmas house while she was away. We live in a three bedroom house with 6(including her and myself ) children and two adults. So because we didn't have enough rooms we decided to make the sunroom my bedroom. All is good. Until the cousin gets home and everyone is faced with the question of \"where is she going to sleep??\"  Now I want to make it clear that I have no problem with her being in my room. There is no other room she could sleep in. We have a nice air mattress and we have a cot. But I got introuble today for voicing that I didn't want her to sleep in my bed with me. She creeps around at night and I don't want to wake up to her touching me or anything weird. It's gross. I've caught her creeping on me in the shower and when I'm getting dressed. I used to just think it was curiosity since I'm older and she might have been curious about the female body or whatever. But then the molestation thing came out. I don't want her sleeping in my bed with me but my mom is acting like I'm being immoral. \n\nOh and she is 9 and I'm 16. I want to make it clear that I'm in no way afraid of her. I just don't want myself put in the situation to where I could be fondled in my sleep by ANYONE, of any age or gender. ",

She lives off welfare and she has 8 children from 5 different fathers. She currently lives in a small camper on my grandmother\u2019s property. \n\nSo, I ask her to give me a ride to my therapist. Everything went well. Then on the way back she said I had to pay for gas. I find this rather insulting. My mom owes me an occasional favor and if she can\u2019t even pay for the gas to drive me somewhere, it means it\u2019s not a favor. I shouldn\u2019t have to coff up money for her to do a simple task. So she drives back with all her younger kids in the car, 5 children all under 10. Then she drives past mcdonalds and my sister cries for mcdonalds. Then we stop somewhere, i bought my other sister a drink, and after that she pulls into mcdonalds. She asked me if I\u2019ll pay for it and that she\u2019ll have plenty of money to give back later because her boyfriend is going to give her a lot. I really don\u2019t want to, but I agreed if she would pay extra. I threw in one burger for myself and just decide that\u2019s my dinner. The cost amounts together to 14 dollars and I said she can pay me back 20. She made me pay for gas last time so in my mind it sort of makes up for it. \n\nSo then her boyfriend doesn\u2019t show up. Then she said he\u2019ll be there tomorrow. Then he doesn\u2019t show up. She demands I buy her a coke because \u201cI\u2019m having withdrawals\u201d. I bought it for her. Then she drives to her drug dealer\u2019s. I can\u2019t prove shs bought drugs but she usually buys Xanax from him. That night we get into big a fight, about some other topic. I storm off.\n\nThen I show up the day after *that*, asking for my money. She just starts crying and arguing with me, telling me she drove me somewhere and how it was only 14 dollars and I got myself something too. I was just so pissed off from yesterday\u2019s fight that I didn\u2019t give a fuck about her crying. I basically stormed off again uttering \u201cworthless!\u201d \n\nAm I the asshole in this case?

Earlier this year when my parents asked me what I wanted, I asked them not to buy me any gifts and to please only give me cash as I have some credit card debt I'm trying to pay down as soon as possible.\n\nWe just finished opening our gifts, and I know how ungrateful this makes me sound, but there was not a single thing they got me that I like or will use. I got a sweater that's three sizes too big (XL when I wear a S), some jewelry that is my mother's style and not mine at all, a phone charger that's for some Android phone (we all have iPhones), nuts when they know I have an allergy, etc. No receipts for anything so I can't exchange or return them. I put on a fake smile and said thank you for everything, but my family saw through that pretty quickly. They kept asking me, \"you don't like what we got you?\" over and over. At first I told them of course I like my gifts, but they kept pestering me like they wanted me to admit I didn't like them. So finally, I asked them if they wanted to know the truth and they said yes. I told them I appreciate them shopping for me and the time it took to pick out gifts, but that yeah, there were some things I didn't like.\n\nBoth of them got upset and asked me why I don't appreciate them and why I had to ruin Christmas. I admit I got defensive at this point and asked them why they kept bothering me about it if they didn't want to hear the truth. They have always told me never to lie to them even if the truth isn't pretty, our family can be super blunt at times, so I figured if they kept asking they wanted to know how I really felt. This started to escalate into a fight and my dad stormed into the garage and drove off. My mom just shut down and stopped talking to me so I went to bed. I think in the morning I'm just going to go home.\n\nAITA for telling the truth about not liking my gifts? Should I have just kept lying?",

I expressed my concern over foreign influences in the country, especially those coming from the jewish lobby and said how I believe national socialism would be better system than the one we currently have as it prevents corruption, puts emphasis on love for one's nation and has no tolerance for anything harming the volk. Some people started insulting me but teacher was able to maintain order. \n\nA bit later a topic of women's rights came up. My position was that women should be valued memebers of society but not equal to men. Adolf Hitler put it nicely in one of his speeches: \n\n\"If the man\u2019s world is said to be the State, his struggle, his readiness to devote his powers to the service of the community, then it may perhaps be said that the woman\u2019s is a smaller world. For her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home. But what would become of the greater world if there were no one to tend and care for the smaller one? How could the greater world survive if there were no one to make the cares of the smaller world the content of their lives?\n\nNo, the greater world is built on the foundation of this smaller world. This great world cannot survive if the smaller world is not stable. Providence has entrusted to the woman the cares of that world which is her very own, and only on the basis of this smaller world can the man\u2019s world be formed and built up. The two worlds are not antagonistic. They complement each other, they belong together just as man and woman belong together.\"\n\nI did not say those exact lines in class but something similar.A few feminist classmates had a meltdown and said I was sexist, racist, horrible person and stuff like that. At first I remained calm and told them they shouldn't hate someone based on prejudices they hold  and suggested they read works of Hitler Goebbels, David Duke and few other authors. However, they kept insulting me so I finally lost it and told them to go fuck themselves. The class was dismissed as it got out of control and now I need to visit the principal's office tomorrow as one of the feminist girls reported me for \"hate speech\". \n\n",

I am always in \u201coffline mode\u201d so I really don\u2019t mind that he\u2019s using it, until recently. \n\nOn to the story\n\nLately I\u2019ve been online because I\u2019ve been listening to new music, but every time I go on Spotify, he\u2019s on it. If you don\u2019t know, Spotify (the regular version) isn\u2019t meant to have two people listening to it, so I can\u2019t use it while he\u2019s using it.

I told her I'll always support her (and obviously hope for her relationship to work), but that I don't like and never will trust her boyfriend. Because I expressed my feelings for him, she got upset that her closest friend doesn't approve of the man she loves. After this, we no longer saw each other as often as we used to. We didn't fight or anything, but she did get pretty upset and defensive over my opinion. We both have a lot of free time to see each other, so not having the time to get together isn't the problem.\n\nOut of the last 7 times (I recently started keeping track lol) I've tried making plans, 4 times she told me she couldn't because she felt like staying in. Okay, that's fine, I get it, but then 2 of those 4 times she ended up going out with another mutual friend (I saw her in snapchats from our mutual friend). The other 3 times we had plans and she either \"forgot\" (and went out with someone else) or canceled last minute. During these couple of months she has not tried to make plans with me at all.\n\nSo recently, about 3 weeks ago I decided to stop trying to make plans and let her reach out to me. She hasn't, but a little while ago I got a text asking me if I wanted to help her move. I helped her move last time, and she told me she wouldn't have burdened me (by helping her), if she had a bigger car. I have a large suv, which is why she asked me back then, so I feel like now she's only asking me because she needs to utilize my truck. \n\nTL;DR: A friend who has been avoiding getting together because I told her I don't like her cheating boyfriend, has reached out to me (for the first time in 2 months) and asked if I wanted to help her move. Trying to make plans has been completely one-sided (from me) for the past couple of months, so I'm reluctant to say yes to helping her since this is the first time she's asked to \"get together\" in a while.

If we have a crowded memorial service, I\u2019ve got a bad feeling that someone is going to try to pull something on the anniversary when 700+ students are all packed in one place.\n\nI really want to propose to the coordinator, principal, and possibly the superintendent about safety precautions, as well as change event plans so it\u2019s not crowded and dangerous.

Since I can\u2019t vet everyone on the sub for relevant life experience, or law degrees, or medical degrees, or social worker licenses, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable that I should tell a stranger to trust that their advice is well-informed, or even the completed thinking of an rational adult.   \n\nBecause of this, we\u2019re now instituting the rule that **All submissions that ask for advice will be removed.**\n\nWe\u2019re not yet saying that commenters may not give advice; we just need it to be clear that it\u2019s not what we do here.  As long as you make your judgement clear, follow up advice is allowed.  But please be careful about spouting off when you may not know enough to really tell someone what to do.   Before you tell someone to throw a punch in righteous fury, try to remember you don\u2019t necessarily know the legal consequences of battery where he lives, or if the target has deadly martial arts training, or rather an undiscovered heart condition that means he\u2019s going to die if he takes a harsh tap to the chest.  Please just be mindful.  We\u2019ll be forced to remove potentially reckless or violent advice due to reddit\u2019s policies alone.",

So yesterday we agreed to have salad so I made both of us one: I told her that the meat I put in it was tofu and she ate it all up. I asked her if she enjoyed her meal and she said that she loved it. Then I told her that she just eaten an animal and enjoyed it. I expected her to be happy to realize that meat didn\u2019t taste bad but she actually started crying and hasn\u2019t talked to me after. I can kind  of realize where she is coming from but for the most part it seems like she is the asshole for ignoring me for trying to help her. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "Preface: Every year, my calc teacher assigns the cross section project, which is incredibly time-consuming and difficult. In my junior year, I did the project for the first time with my longtime friend, who I've partnered up quite frequently for projects. This could be a biased opinion, so take it as you will, but I believe I'm usually a fairly competent partner; I make sure to finish my part on time with effort. I can say with certainty that I did not slack on this project and gave it my utmost effort; we were one of the earliest groups to begin and I worked steadily every time we met up to do the project. However, I completely screwed up on it and had to essentially redo it so it would be more aesthetically pleasing (aesthetics factored into our grade). Unfortunately, because I'd already wasted so much time, I couldn't finish it alone and had to beg for my partner's help. She'd already finished her part and as a result, she grew very annoyed that she had to spend extra time on mine. I also asked her for her help last minute because it was only until it was too late that I realized I couldn't finish it alone, and going over to her house so late at night (10 PM - 1 AM) did not help her mood.\n\nFast forward a bit later into the year when we were about to form groups for a club project, I realized that she kicked me out of her group. Since we've partnered for the same project every single year, I was really hurt that she kicked me out. At the time, I didn't know why she kicked me out, but I gathered up my courage to ask her what she was mad at me for. She gave me this long message about how I was always super difficult to talk to, always compared test scores, and always invited myself over to her house for projects (calc project) and didn't even clean up after myself. She said her kicking me out was the result of pent-up frustrations, not merely one event. I gave her a halfhearted apology for all my misdeeds, and I say halfhearted because I was pretty angry too by the time I finished reading her message (I know half-ass apologies are always bad, but please keep reading). I sent a long message back about how I was always the one who messaged her first (I counted), how she'd only message me first if the topic was homework, so how I was I difficult to talk to if she never tried? I also admitted that I used to frequently ask her about her test scores, but she would always tell our other, mutual friends and not tell me, so I couldn't help but feel left out; as a result, I kept pushing my questions. (This habit was also a freshman/sophomore thing, and I'd long since stopped once junior year began, which is the year we had the calc project.) Not to mention how she would always take to teasing me about this one guy even though I'd stated many times that I hated being teased like that (sooo many people did this to me, it stopped being funny after freshman year and I wanted to be known for myself, not for this relationship.) The calc project I admitted that I screwed up, but I didn't think it warranted being kicked out of the club project we worked on for two years together.\n\nSo anyway, am I the asshole in this situation? Have I just been a terrible friend/project partner all these years and not realized it? Was I the asshole for not apologizing properly? Our mutual friend reckons that I should've apologized for everything even if I didn't think I was wrong, while my other friend doesn't think anything I said would've made a difference. In the meantime, I've become a more conscious project partner and thought about how my actions/attitudes might affect my partners, if that means anything. However, I just want to know your thoughts about this specific scenario.\n\nSorry for such a long text, I've been feeling really down about the whole situation and want an outside perspective.\n\n**TLDR; screwed up on calc project, former friend kicked me out of subsequent club project, I asked her why, she told me why, I also released all my frustrations, am I the asshole?**",

Some people were happy about this, but many were not because top comments usually do not change after a few hours. And people wanted to see threads before they disappeared from the \"hot\" sorting. \n\nWell, you talked, we listened. Flairs are now going to be automatically assigned (if applicable) after only **six hours.** This doesn't prevent you from posting in the thread, but it allows you to use subreddit flairs more to your own preferences.\n\n\u2014-\n\nAdditionally, yesterday we tested out a contest mode where vote scores were hidden. The purpose here was to randomize content so people would not get influenced by the vote score. \n\nWell you all hated it. But today we are testing a **one hour contest mode**. This means for the first hour after a thread is posted, comments will have hidden scores and will show up in a random order. \n\nThe purpose of this change is to prevent the first few posters from becoming the top voted. We don\u2019t think it makes sense to reward people for commenting first. Scores will show up after one hour and then everything will return to normal. \n\n\u2014- \n\nPlease give us time to implement the changes. Some of you may experience temporary issues. \n\nPlease provide your feedback on both changes below!\n\nHappy judging!",
